"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid by the ducks: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house was $80,000, and Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost is:
$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 
The original value of the house was $80,000. 
The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is:
$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit:
$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, so the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he runs in a week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed her chickens need in a day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals, each chicken needs 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 9 * 20 = 180 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can group the remaining 14 glasses into 7 pairs. Each pair will have one glass at full price ($5) and one glass at 60% of the price ($3).

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 
There are 7 pairs, so the cost of the remaining 14 glasses is 7 * $8 = $56.

Adding the cost of the first two glasses ($5 + $3 = $8) to the cost of the remaining 14 glasses ($56), we get the total cost.

Total cost = $8 + $56 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find out how many sheep each city has. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she has to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the time to download the entire file: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move at all. 

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

So, the total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Initially, John drove 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Since he was trying to get home, the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around should be subtracted from the initial distance. 

Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 - 135 = 45 miles.

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Her regular pay is for the first 40 hours, and her rate is $10 per hour. So, her regular pay is:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

She worked 5 hours overtime (45 hours - 40 hours). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime pay is:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. 
So, the second month downloads = 3 * 60 = 180.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. 
To find the third month downloads, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180.
30% of 180 = 0.3 * 180 = 54.
So, the third month downloads = 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month.
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, Carlos will earn $1.5 * 7 = $10.5 from selling the lemons, but he will also spend $3 on watering and feeding the tree. So, his net earnings per year will be $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. We can divide the initial cost by the net earnings per year to find out how many years it will take:

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

However, this is the time it takes to break even, not to start earning money. Since Carlos will start earning money after the initial cost is covered, we need to subtract 1 from the result, because he will start earning money in the 12th year, but he will have already covered the cost by the end of the 11th year and will start earning money in the 12th year.

So, the correct answer is 12 years, but since he will start earning money in the 12th year, we can say he will start earning money after 11 years of expenses.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more to the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.
At the red house, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners.
At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

The total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at each house:
x/3 + 2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number she sold is 5:
x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2) = 5

Simplifying the equation:
x - x/3 - 2 - (x/2 - x/6 - 1) = 5
x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/6 + 1 = 5
Combine like terms:
(6x - 2x - 6 - 3x + x)/6 = 5
(2x - 6)/6 = 5
2x - 6 = 30
2x = 36
x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to find the difference between the new value and the initial value for each option and choose the one with the highest difference.

Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the merchant will make a higher profit from the jewelry.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

84 / 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. We started with 10 liters, but spilled 1 liter, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to first find out how old Raymond is now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15. 
4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the cost of the other items from the total: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen, and then add 10 years to Allen's age.

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, since their ages are in the ratio of 7:11.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1 point. So, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to find out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. $160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend all the money he made from selling lego sets. The difference is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his speed in miles per hour. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he runs in total. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total hours = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
Total hours = 6 hours

Now, we know that John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours.

Speed = Total miles / Total hours
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel, we need to find her running and walking speeds. 

We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 2 times her skipping speed, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. So, the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Polly's original throwing distance is 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so we multiply 400 by 3 and then add the original 400 feet.

New throwing distance = 400 * 3 + 400
New throwing distance = 1200 + 400
New throwing distance = 1600 feet

Now, we need to find out how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand. The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the flames, we subtract the dragon's flames distance from Polly's new throwing distance.

Distance outside the flames = New throwing distance - Dragon's flames distance
Distance outside the flames = 1600 - 1000
Distance outside the flames = 600

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had. Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, we multiply 5 by 8.

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.
First, we find out how many grams are in 1 serving:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Now, we multiply the grams per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). 
The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to first find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's start with the number of Post-it notes she used: 220 cups of coffee * 1 Post-it note per cup = 220 Post-it notes used.

We know that Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is the sum of the Post-it notes she used and the Post-it notes she had remaining: 220 Post-it notes used + 23 Post-it notes remaining = 243 Post-it notes.

Now, we subtract the number of Post-it notes Candice had initially from the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased: 243 Post-it notes - 80 Post-it notes initially = 163 Post-it notes.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is 2 times the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of each blue tie and add it to the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = 120 units * (3/4) = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, we multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to find the daily earnings.

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by 7.

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight removed from the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
The 10% increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year, after three years, her monthly salary will be:
Year 1: $660
Year 2: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, we multiply her monthly salary after three years by 12 to get her annual salary:
$798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

9583.20"
"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that they sold 88,000 copies combined, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the number of guests that will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2
= 18

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat.

Adults will eat 10 lbs each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat to find the total amount Ted needs to bring:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

"To find Jackson's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, to find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's improved diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time Gerald saved, we need to calculate 10% of his original time. 
10% of 40 seconds is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"To find the total number of pets, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

We know that there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80. 

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys, which is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout, which is 120 - 80 = 40.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (because 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total ounces of canned tomatoes (64) by the ounces per can (16). 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.

4 * 3 = 12

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in this number. We already know that 5 cars took the exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day, we first need to find out the total number of pages he needs to read. 

He has to read 4 pages from Science, 20 pages from Social Studies, 7 pages from History, and 8 pages from Geography. 

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.

He has 4 more days to complete all his reading. 

To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the total number of pages left by the number of days left.

Average pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.

Poppy placed a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

After Poppy placed 250 pieces, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom then placed a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500.

So, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, we subtract the hours he watched on other days from the total hours: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry had 110 cookies. So before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he meant to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation: 2x = 100, where x is the number of cookies he baked last year.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the original price (100% + 50% increase).

The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes: 
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time to hours: 
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost of the doctors to the hospital is: 
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is: 
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the revenue minus the cost: 
$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

"To find out how many elves are left, we need to first calculate how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can divide the total number of elves by 3.

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves to find the remaining number of elves.

60 - 20 = 40 elves

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract 10 from the remaining number of elves.

40 - 10 = 30 elves

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for June first. Since his expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, we subtract $60 from $500.

Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to find the total.

Total Expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total Expenditure = $500 + $440
Total Expenditure = $940

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, on Tuesday, Walt walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday, we add 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We are given that Walt's total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles. 

So, miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - miles walked on Monday and Tuesday

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's represent the number of queens as 'q'. Then the number of baby bees is 2q, and the number of worker bees is 2 * 2q = 4q.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is 700.

q + 2q + 4q = 700
Combine like terms:
7q = 700

Now, divide both sides by 7:

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. 
So, in one harvest season, John can harvest 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples harvested in one season by the number of harvests in a year.
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year.

"To find the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Then, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. The raccoon stole 2/3x, and 1/3x remained. We know that 1/3x = 6. To find x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 6 * 3 = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

This is the number of fries after Dave ate 14. To find the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it, we add the 14 fries Dave ate: 34 + 14 = 48.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards one way and 40 yards back). So, Kelly's total distance for these trips is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months. 

The price increase every 2 months is 20% of the original price. 
20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the price increase every 2 months is $4. 

Since the price increases every 2 months, in 36 months, the price will increase 36 / 2 = 18 times.

However, this is not correct. The price increase is 20% of the original price every 2 months, not a fixed $4. We need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Let's break it down:
- After 2 months, the price will be $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
- After 4 months, the price will be $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
- After 6 months, the price will be $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

We can see a pattern here. The price is increasing by 20% every 2 months, which is equivalent to multiplying the price by 1.20 every 2 months.

Since there are 18 periods of 2 months in 36 months, we can multiply the original price by 1.20 eighteen times.

$20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $20 * 55.9017 ≈ $1118.034.

Rounded to two decimal places, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $1118.03.

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 insects. So, the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

The rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them. So, the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to find the age of each bird. 

We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

To find the total age, we add the ages of all four birds: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment and then add 50% to it.

The total minimum payment is $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000 per month.

To find 50% of the total minimum payment, we multiply $1000 by 0.5, which is $500. 

Now, we add this 50% to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

$18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut a potato, we need to add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cut. 

Time to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut a potato: 5 seconds = 0.0833 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by 60.

Total time to peel and cut 60 potatoes: 1.5833 * 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate their total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's find out how much they made in total. They made $25 in profit, but we don't know their total revenue yet. We do know that their cost for each gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which is $5 per gallon.

Let's say they made x gallons of lemonade. Then, their total cost is $5x. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $10 per gallon (20 glasses * $0.50 per glass). 

Their total revenue is $10x. Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation: 
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5

So they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. They spent $3 per gallon on lemons, so they spent $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants: 160 - 60 = 100.

The number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his total expenses and donations.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$

Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$

Remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$

Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200 + 700 = 900$

Total remaining amount after all expenses and donations: 1250 - 900 = 350

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

Total number of crabs: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate the total hours he worked and multiply it by his hourly wage.

In the first week, Lloyd worked 5 hours. In the second week, he worked 8 hours. So, the total hours he worked is 5 + 8 = 13 hours.

Lloyd earns $10 per hour. To find out his total earnings, we multiply the total hours he worked by his hourly wage: 13 hours * $10/hour = $130.

"To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of white carnations. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

We also know Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time taken by the faster team from the total time taken by the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the numbers 4, 5, and 6 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities.

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

Now, let's find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probabilities = 50% - 25% = 25%

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to find out the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. We know that 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. 

Let's start with the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Since there is one hamster per cage, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents in total, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We already know that 50 pieces of straw are given to the hamsters. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 140 - 50 = 90.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find out the total number of rats, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6. 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we divide the total number of rats by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage. 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

Let's assume the trader bought 'x' bags of wheat. The cost price of each bag is $20, and the transportation cost is $2 per bag. So, the total cost price per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, and the profit per bag is $8. To find the number of bags, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net gain of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

In 10 years, he gains 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

The total number of trees after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (gained trees) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's add the money Sara already had and the money she earned from babysitting: $10 + $20 = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns each time she mows the lawn ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons for each pool.

So, the amount of water left in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water left in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water left in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt, and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back. This includes the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to find out how many dahlias are there and add that to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 
Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.
Total flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total flowers = 4 + 11
Total flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find out how many points they scored in total. 
68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students.

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type

Ram buys 25 pens initially. When the ink runs low, he can make new pens from the empty ones. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, we can divide the number of empty pens by 5 to find the number of new pens he can make.

After using the 25 pens, he has 25 empty pens. He can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from these.

Now, he has 5 new pens and the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually. He will have 5 more empty pens, which can be used to make 5 / 5 = 1 more new pen.

Now, he has 1 new pen and the 1 new pen will also run out of ink eventually. He will have 1 more empty pen, but it's not enough to make another pen since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to find the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea's apples: 52
Andrea's bananas: 24
Jamal's apples: 44
Jamal's bananas: 48
Total number of fruits: 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to find out how many dozens of cookies she's making. 

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, in total, she's making 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. 
66 / 12 = 5.5

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs.

Brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

The total amount paid is $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

"To find the total time, we need to break it down into steps.

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.

Then, it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will have aged 10 years each. So, we need to add 10 years to Mico's age and 10 years to Marco's age. 

This is equivalent to adding 10 + 10 = 20 years to the sum of their current ages. 

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 (current sum) + 20 (total years added) = 40.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S. 

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation: 
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. 
We also know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: 
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation: 
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation: 
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides: 
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3: 
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

Now, let's add up the total number of people: 12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we already have a whole number, so Maddy needs 13 pizzas.

60 miles per day * 5 days per week = 300 miles per week

Since John works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is:
300 miles per week * 50 weeks per year = 15,000 miles per year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
15,000 miles per year * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is:
$150 per month * 12 months per year = $1,800 per year

Now, let's add the total cost of driving per year and the total bonus per year:
$30,000 per year + $1,800 per year = $31,800 per year

"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 
So, Sunday + Monday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total minutes by 2. 
39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired perfectly, with no extra pages left over. But in this case, we have an even number of pages (32), so the pairing works out perfectly.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 * $10 = $500.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are 4 weeks in April, so his total bonus is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month. His total earnings from his hourly wage is $500 * 4 = $2000. Adding the bonus, his total earnings for the month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

John arm-wrestled 20 people and beat 80% of them. To find 80% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.8.

20 * 0.8 = 16

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract 16 from the total number of people he arm-wrestled.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * 2/3 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we divide 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide 10 by 2 to find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.

10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he lost (8 pounds) by the number of weeks it took him to lose that weight (4 weeks). 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We know that Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, so to lose 8 pounds, it will take:

8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 4 * 2 = 8 weeks for 8 pounds, but since 8 pounds is 4 times 2 pounds, and 4 weeks is the time it takes for 2 pounds, then 4 * 4 weeks is 16 weeks for 8 pounds, but that is 4 times 4 weeks, so 4 * 4 = 16 weeks is the time it takes for 8 pounds.

However, a simpler way to look at it is that if Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in 1 week, then it will take Sandy 4 * 4 = 16 weeks to lose what Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we're buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses first.

He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the suits is 6 * $100 = $600.

He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all his expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so we subtract his expenses and savings from his total budget: $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050.

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs in a day.

The rest of the family members (5 - 3 = 2) eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs in a day.

The total number of eggs the family eats in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs they eat in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Jane's age = 27

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the population now is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is 'D'. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to find the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we first need to find the new distance he runs each day. 

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 of 5000 meters = (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this to the original distance to get the new distance.
New distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new distance by 30 to get the total distance covered in June.
Total distance = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
Juice Box C is 11 dollars and Juice Box B is 9 dollars, so the difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the percentage increase in the daily earnings, we first need to calculate the daily earnings when they made tractors and when they make silos.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor. So, their daily earnings were:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So, their daily earnings are:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find the percentage increase, we need to find the difference in daily earnings and divide it by the original daily earnings, then multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = ((New earnings - Old earnings) / Old earnings) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

The cost of treats per month is $20.

The cost of medicine per month is $100.

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3 * Total time = 15 hours
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing. 
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding her earnings from both jobs to her initial savings, we get 200 + 75 + 80 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs to save 400 - 355 = $45.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person and then divide the total budget by that cost.

The cost per person is the cost of mini-golf ($5) + the cost of arcade tokens ($5) + the cost of two go-kart rides (2 * $10 = $20). 
So, the total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, we need to subtract the cost for Morgan herself from the total budget, since the question asks how many friends she can invite. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find out how many friends Morgan can invite. 
$60 / $30 = 2.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be $2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in a day and then divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by that daily distance.

First, let's find the distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance the train travels in a day. The train travels 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles per trip, and it makes 3 trips per day. So, the total distance per day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the daily distance: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

So, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. 
So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 7 = 21.

The principal amount is $3,650 and the interest rate is 10% per year. Since she borrowed the money for 5 months, we need to convert the interest rate to a monthly rate. There are 12 months in a year, so the monthly interest rate is 10%/12 = 0.008333 (or approximately 0.8333% per month).

However, to simplify the calculation, we can calculate the total interest for 5 months first. The total interest for 5 months is $3,650 * (10%/12) * 5 = $3,650 * 0.041667 = $152.08.

Now, we add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount she has to pay: $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08.

Her profit is her total revenue minus her total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours she spends running the stand, which is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add that to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, so she needs 9 x 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so she spends 18 x $2 = $36.

Now, let's compare the costs: David spends $30, while Dasha spends $36. 

$36 - $30 = $6

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first find out the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12 gifts) to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Inches of ribbon per gift bow = Total inches of ribbon / Total gifts
Inches of ribbon per gift bow = 144 / 12
Inches of ribbon per gift bow = 12

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's say Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles. The total number of popsicles they have together is 5x + 6x = 11x.

We are given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 165.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11. This gives us x = 165 / 11 = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find out how many popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has. This gives us 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find out how much money Tim saves, we need to calculate the total cost of his new streaming services and compare it to his old cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 = $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, he saves $4 on Hulu and Disney Plus, making the total cost $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare this to his old cable package, which cost $60 a month. 
The amount of money he saves is $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Total time spent on the song is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out 24 + 5 = 29 cards in total.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21.

Then, we add the cards she received: 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices. 

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark. 

Now, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from the remaining slices: 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks/year

So, the total number of days he works in a year is:

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk. 

For flour, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups, so 4 times that is 3 * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup, so 4 times that is 1 * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. Since Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy used in a day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The energy used in a day will be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

The energy saved in a day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved in a day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

"To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the ones he bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

The total number of corns is 80 + 60 = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 + 100 = 240.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 3/4 * 40 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of camels and dromedaries. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'.

We know that the total number of heads (or animals) is 180, so we can write an equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. The total number of humps is 304, so we can write another equation:
2c + d = 304

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' and 'd' by substituting the first equation into the second equation.

Rearranging the first equation to isolate 'd', we get:
d = 180 - c

Substituting this expression for 'd' into the second equation, we get:
2c + (180 - c) = 304

Combine like terms:
c + 180 = 304

Subtract 180 from both sides:
c = 124

Now that we know 'c', we can find 'd' by substituting 'c' into one of the original equations:
d = 180 - c
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56.

2/3x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who might want two, and 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests who would only want one. 

So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs one hotdog to have a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs, which is 26.

However, this is not the case. The 26 shortage of hotdogs means that 26 guests will only get one hotdog, but they already had one. So, the 26 shortage of hotdogs means that 26 guests will not get a second hotdog, but this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of guests who will not get a second hotdog because there are not enough hotdogs for them to have a second hotdog. 

Since 54 hotdogs were prepared, and 40 guests showed up, 40 guests can have one hotdog each, which is 40 hotdogs. This leaves 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs. 

14 hotdogs can be given to 14 guests as their second hotdog. This means that 40 - 14 = 26 guests will not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. So, her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7).

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. 

3/4 gallon * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first calculate how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Since George had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Now, subtract the money spent on chips from the total amount spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a candy bar to find out how many candy bars George bought: $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten by Rory and her mom from the total weight of the cake.

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of cake. Since the cake is cut into 8 pieces, we divide the total weight by 8:
20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people (including Sitti and Juris). 
There are 2 of them and 6 other friends, so the total number of people is 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then add the extra 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne's departure time.

However, the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, so we need to subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from Bernadette's total time. 

The difference in their departure times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes for the drive, plus the extra 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne, which is 12 + 5 = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We already know the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert the length to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3 feet per yard.

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. We can use this formula to find the width.

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature after baking and then after opening the window.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total increase in temperature is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature decreases by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim is 10% faster than Jon's. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' time for the bike ride is 5 minutes longer than Jon's. 
So James' bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

Now, we know Movie C is 75 minutes long. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4:

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. 

Now, we multiply the speed of the horse (32 miles per hour) by the time (0.5 hours) to get the distance: 
32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and it runs 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has: 
$30 - $24 = $6.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $2 less than the super ticket option. So, we can set up the equation:

$12 + $3 + x = $21 - $2
$15 + x = $19

Subtracting $15 from both sides gives us:

"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

The pen cost $2. The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. $1 less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.

So, the total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 she gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to calculate step by step.

Initially, there were 30 students with 10 pencils each. So, the total number of pencils at the start of the year is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 1/5, which is 300 * 1/5 = 60 pencils used.

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we multiply 240 by 1/3, which is 240 * 1/3 = 80 pencils.

So, the number of pencils left is 80.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks is x/2. He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. 

The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is 5. So, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, x/2 = 3.

Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get x by itself: x = 3 * 2, x = 6.

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.

The remoras are 6 inches long each, and there are 2 of them, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of students, we need to determine what fraction of the students do not have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers.

Let's say the total number of students is x. Then, one-fourth of x is equal to 20 (the number of students without desktop computers).

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4: x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has is 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days.

The total walking time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. To find out how long he has to spend walking each day, we divide the total walking time by the total number of days: 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we need to subtract 3 from the total to avoid counting them twice.

Total kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = (kids allergic to dairy) + (kids allergic to peanuts) - (kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total kids in class - Total kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors to find the cost per razor: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal. Today is December 31st, and his birthday is on July 19th. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December, there is 1 day. 
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. 
July has 31 days, but Andy's birthday is on July 19th, so we only count 19 days in July.

Total days = 1 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) 
Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 
Total days = 201 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds is:
Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound
Total calorie deficit = 105,000 calories

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total minutes of the fight is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can find Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has initially, then find out how much he gives to his sister, and finally determine how much he spends on dinner.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how many minutes Royce takes, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert the hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. Double Rob's time is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. 

Now, we add 40 minutes to this time to find out how many minutes Royce takes.

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha will need, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by 3 (since there are 3 grandchildren).

- A hat requires 2 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.
- A scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.
- A sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
- A pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.
- A pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins required: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Wednesday is 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate each of their individual rates and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add their individual rates together: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find the total number of rows, we need to find the number of rows for each color of tulips and then add them together.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips (36) by the number of red tulips per row (6). 
36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips (24) by the number of blue tulips per row (8). 
24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to get the total number of rows. 
6 rows + 3 rows = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Number of uses = 3 (cookies, granola, snack mix)
Cups of raisins for cookies = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make, we divide the cups of raisins for cookies by the amount of raisins per batch.

Cups of raisins for cookies = 9 cups
Raisins per batch = 3/4 cup
Number of batches = 9 cups / (3/4 cup) = 9 / 0.75 = 12

Number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption in kWh.
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kWh to get the weekly electric bill.
Weekly bill before: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024
Weekly bill after: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the weekly bill after minus the weekly bill before.
Difference: $3528 - $3024 = $504

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint the whole house in 10 days (since 2 halves make a whole).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we need to find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since there are 5 people, the work will be divided among them, so we divide the total hours by 5.

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs. 
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs = $44 / $4
Number of CDs = 11

Since Tom already bought 1 CD, we need to find out how many more CDs he could have bought.

More CDs = Number of CDs - 1
More CDs = 11 - 1
More CDs = 10

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and add the hours spent in the weeks where he worked out for 5 and 6 hours.

Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since he worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week). 
So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

He worked out for 5 hours a week for 2 weeks, so the total hours spent in those 2 weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

He worked out for 6 hours in 1 week.

Now, we add the total hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame will be 27 in 5 years, in 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 3 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up an equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of printer + Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost
$1,100 + $700 + Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400

Combine the cost of the computer and printer:
$1,800 + Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to know how many boys and girls there were. Since the kids were divided into two equal groups, there were 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 = 2400). So the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + 2400 = 3000.

To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save in total for the month, which is $1125.

Since April has 30 days, the first half of the month is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, in the second half, he saves twice as much, which is 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. 
Total savings = (15 * x) + (15 * 2x)
Total savings = 15x + 30x
Total savings = 45x

We know the total savings is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
45x = 1125

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

However, 'x' is the amount Elvis saves in the first half. We need to find the amount he saves in the second half, which is 2x:
2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

So, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so 3 * 3 = 9 new families are notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so 9 * 3 = 27 new families are notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so 27 * 3 = 81 new families are notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Final weight = 70 pounds
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James has 80 toys, so five times that amount is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. So, if we subtract 2 from 400, we get the number of toys Jonathan currently has. 

400 - 2 = 398

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together. 

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30 and subtract it from the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 x $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission. 
30% of $1000 is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500, she earns a 40% commission (30% + 10%).
40% of $1500 is 0.4 * $1500 = $600.

Now, we add the commission from both parts to find the total amount she earned.
$300 + $600 = $900.

"To find out how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, we multiply 70 by 2.

70 * 2 = 140 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles he already has. He started with 2 cases of water, each with 24 bottles. We multiply 2 by 24.

2 * 24 = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 - 48 = 92

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time it takes to swim in warm water is the same as in hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much he earns per week and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost of lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, so it costs 3 * $40 = $120.

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of lunch: $40 + $120 = $160.

"To find the total number of holes, we need to find the number of buttons with 2 holes and the number of buttons with 4 holes. 

We know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes. The number of buttons with 4 holes is the total number of buttons minus the number of buttons with 2 holes. 
So, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, we can find the total number of holes. 
The number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes is 7 * 2 = 14.
The number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes is 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to know how much coffee Octavia and Juan drink.

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from Juan's current coffee intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since James has 2 sons, and we know their ages, we can assume he'll buy candles equal to their ages. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total. Since the candles come in packs of 5, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, we multiply 15 minutes by 7 nights.

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we know Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes, we first need to find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 minutes by 1.5 minutes.

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 pages.

70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages

However, this is not the total number of pages she read in two weeks. We know she read 100 pages in the second week. To find the total number of pages, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week.

140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first find out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3x.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since 'x' is the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from 'x': 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many he bought each day.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide $70 by 7 to find out how much he can spend each day:
$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent $10 per day on wooden action figures. The number of wooden action figures he bought each day is:
$10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day
Since he bought wooden action figures for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures is:
2 wooden action figures per day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He still has $10 per day to spend, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy each day is:
$10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day
Since he buys plastic action figures for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures is:
5 plastic action figures per day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures:

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw and divide it by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On day three, he saw 0 birds. 
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. 
On day six, he saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7

The starting value is 20. 
Half of the number is 20 / 2 = 10. 
The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30. 
This value divided by 5 is 30 / 5 = 6. 
The starting value minus 12 is 20 - 12 = 8. 
The resulting value multiplied by the starting value minus 12 is 6 * 8 = 48.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees and the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven at.
Actual temperature = x + (4% of x)
= x + (0.04x)
= 1.04x

Since the actual temperature should be 520, we can set up the equation:
1.04x = 520

To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

Temperature to set: 500"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour into 60 minutes. So, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes, we get 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to this, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy and her friend brought.

A dozen cups is equal to 12 cups. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cups and dishes:
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes: 24 + 44 = 68

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's 10% off, so the discount is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. The price of 1 box after the discount is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we know that 1 box has 90 contacts and will last 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours each of them worked and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours are 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours are 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill worked 3 hours at $10 per hour, so she earned 3 * 10 = $30. John worked 7 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 7 * 10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This means if the number of blue jelly beans is B, then the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since 1% less is the same as 99% of the original amount).

We also know that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This means if the number of blue jelly beans is B, then the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since 1% more is the same as 101% of the original amount).

We are also given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Number of green jelly beans = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost. Since he loses weight with Cheerios and gains weight with donuts, we add the absolute values of the weight change: 8.75 (gained) + 6.25 (lost) = 15 pounds.

100 (initial invitees) + 100 * 2 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, let's calculate the number of people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day as follows:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means if we go back 5 years, his age at that time multiplied by 2 equals his current age. 

Let's call Jerry's current age 'x'. Then, 5 years ago, Jerry's age was 'x - 5'. According to the problem, x = 2(x - 5). 

Now, let's solve for x: 
x = 2(x - 5) 
x = 2x - 10 
x - 2x = -10 
-x = -10 
x = 10 

So Jerry is 10 years old now. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of 2 implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. 
He also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). 

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's call the smallest angle 'x'. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other angles. The angle that's twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. The angle that's three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since 90 degrees is the largest angle, that's our answer.

- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire undergoes in a year. 
Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, it rotates 725 / 2 = 362.5 times per mile.
Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so in a year (12 months), he drives 400 * 12 = 4800 miles.
The total number of rotations in a year is 362.5 * 4800 = 1,740,000.

However, we can simply multiply the number of pumps per washing by the number of washings and then divide by the number of pumps per washing to find the total number of washings for 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. 

Now, we know that 1 pump gives 60 washings. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. 

To find the cost of each pump, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of pumps. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the total number of pumps is 120 washings * (2 pumps / 120 washings) * (1 pump / 2 pumps) * (60 washings / 1 pump) = 60.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so its height became 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day and then divide the weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

"To find the number of students, we need to first find the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of 72 is 72 / 4 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. The number of seats occupied by the students is 54 - 18 = 36.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to find the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, we add the remaining plays for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

Total number of plays before they break: 1509"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours each time. So, the total number of hours per week is 2 hours/session * 2 sessions/week = 4 hours/week.

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125. To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we can convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second by dividing by 1000.

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply her speed by 3600.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately, then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then subtract Adam's current height from it. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take him to be tall enough:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars to the company. 
The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire each car. 
30% of $25,000 is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost to the company is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

The total revenue from selling the cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. 
So, the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600.

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 
So, the price of the silver jewel is $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. 

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed. 
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to first determine the maximum amount his parents are willing to pay per class, which is $10. 

Since Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60, we can calculate the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes: $60 / 10 classes = $6 per class.

However, his parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. To find the maximum number of classes he can miss, we need to find the number of classes that would make the cost per class $10.

Let's say Manny misses 'x' classes. Then, the number of classes he attends is 10 - x. The total cost remains $60.

We can set up an equation to find the number of classes he can miss: 
60 / (10 - x) = 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):
60 = 10(10 - x)
60 = 100 - 10x
10x = 100 - 60
10x = 40
x = 40 / 10
x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple:
$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30 per apple

Now, let's find the cost of 5 apples:
5 apples × $1.30 per apple = $6.50

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange:
$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10 per orange

Now, let's find the cost of 5 oranges:
5 oranges × $1.10 per orange = $5.50

Finally, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total amount Clyde will pay:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Height (H) = 3 feet

Volume = L * W * H
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot.

Time = Volume * Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they are $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The towing package cost is not given, so we will assume it is $0 for this calculation.
The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and add the bonus, then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary:

New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $21000 / 2 = $10500

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21000 + $10500 = $31500

Since the bonus is only given once, we'll calculate the total yearly income by adding the bonus to the new monthly salary multiplied by 12:
Total yearly income = ($21000 * 12) + $10500
Total yearly income = $252000 + $10500
Total yearly income = $262500

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 800

So the sales from green hats is $800. The total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200 = 900

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's use 's' to represent the number of sheep and 'g' to represent the number of geese.

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

Sheep and geese both have 1 head. The total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve the second equation for 'g' by subtracting 's' from both sides:
g = 20 - s

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'g' into the first equation:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70

Combine like terms:
2s + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:
2s = 30

Divide both sides by 2:
s = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 
20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants to buy a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days. 
So, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. 
He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.
He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.
The total cost of these items is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Newspapers delivered to District A and C = 198 + 209 = 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers delivered to District A and C

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by 1.5 hours per recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. 
Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe to find out how many recipes John learns: 48 / 1.5 = 32.

"To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we first need to find the number of math teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining 40% are math teachers.

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90
Number of math teachers = 150 - 90 = 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps.

Total time math teachers spend sleeping = 60 * 6 = 360

"To find the total number of good days left in the month, we first need to find the total number of good days Christina had. 

We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. In the next 3 days, she had 2 good days. 

So, the total number of good days is 12 + 2 = 14.

However, the question asks for the number of good days left in the month. Since we already know the total number of good days in the first 30 days and the next 3 days, we need to find the total number of days in the month. 

A month can have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. Since we don't know the exact number of days in the month, we will assume it to be 30 or 31 days for this problem.

If the month has 30 days, then the total number of good days left is 14 - 12 = 2. However, this is not possible since we already know that the next 3 days had 2 good days.

If the month has 31 days, then the total number of good days left is 14 - 12 = 2. This is also not possible since we already know that the next 3 days had 2 good days.

However, if the month has more than 30 days, then the total number of good days left is 14 - 12 = 2.

But we are given that the first 30 days had 12 good days and the next 3 days had 2 good days. So the total number of good days left in the month is the number of good days left after 33 days.

The number of good days left after 33 days is 14 - 12 = 2.

However, we are given that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. So the first 24 days had 8 good days. The next 6 days had 4 good days. The next 3 days had 2 good days.

"Let's say Sally has 'x' number of books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write an equation to represent this:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3

Now, we subtract the current height from the target height to find the remaining growth needed.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining growth by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Katarina has 68 cookies
Max has 73 cookies
The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies
Summer has 96 cookies

Total number of cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's call the original length 'x'. 

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5). This gives us 1.5x.

She also added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So the final length is 1.5x + 20cm.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each half and then add them together.

Mowing half the lawn in turtle mode: Since it takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn. 
60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

Mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode: Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take half that time to mow half the lawn. 
40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both halves together to get the total time.
30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. 
They've spent 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 
So, the total time they've spent walking so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time they've spent walking from the total time they have:

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we need to first find out how many cookies Greta and Celinda baked in total. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies they baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

They ate 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's call the age of one twin 'x'. Since they are twins, the other twin is also 'x'. 

Now, we know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. So, the age of that triplet is 'x - 7'. Since they are triplets, the other two triplets are also 'x - 7'. 

The combined ages of all five children is 44. We can write this as an equation: 

x + x + (x - 7) + (x - 7) + (x - 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 
5x - 21 = 44

Add 21 to both sides: 
5x = 65

Divide by 5: 
x = 13

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first find out how many minutes he has before dinner and then subtract the time he spends on his homework.

John has 3 hours before dinner. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

John's homework takes 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. So, the total time for homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time for homework from the time before dinner: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to first find the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies. $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of 4 candies is $1.20, so the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved in 10 years, we first need to find out how many coins they save each month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in a year, he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in a year, he saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in 10 years.

Rong saves 240 coins per year, so in 10 years, he saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 336 coins per year, so in 10 years, he saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have saved, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved.

Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to find the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines are 40% of the total bill. The vaccines cost $20 each, and there are 2 of them, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Since the vaccines are 40% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 
$40 = 0.4 * Total bill
To find the total bill, we can divide both sides by 0.4:
Total bill = $40 / 0.4
Total bill = $100

Now that we know the total bill, we can find out how much John leaves with. He brought $125 with him, so we subtract the total bill from that:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of all the fruits in it. 

First, we need to find the cost of each fruit:
- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of an apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of a banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits to find the total cost of the crate:
$5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color of squares. 

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of each color of squares to find the total number of squares: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she already has and the total number of people attending the function.

Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 8 * 5 = 40.

Total chairs Mia already has = 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people attending the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need to consider that there are already 8 high chairs, which is enough for the 15 babies (assuming one baby per high chair). So, we only need to consider the number of regular chairs needed for the adults.

Number of regular chairs needed for adults = 42 adults.

Mia already has 40 regular chairs, so she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

Betty has 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Marta: 105

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate how many slices were eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There were 5 pizzas in total (Bryce and 4 friends), each with 12 slices. So the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas. 2/3 of 3 pizzas is 2 pizzas. 2 pizzas have 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The 2 remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate ¾ of 2 pizzas. ¾ of 2 pizzas is 1.5 pizzas. 1.5 pizzas have 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

In total, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

To find out how many slices were left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. 
The dog takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we find the average time by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, then dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. Then, we can write an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, 2000 people out of the remaining 3000 had voted. The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we need to divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces in a pack.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores.
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores.
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed.
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total sleeves by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate candidate A's votes as follows:
20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find out how many votes candidate B got, we can calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:
50% of 20 = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know that candidate A got 20 votes and candidate B got 30 votes. The total number of votes they got is:

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube and makes 7 cubes, so he uses 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube and makes 8 cubes, so he uses 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, but she's trading for large buttons, we need to find out how many large buttons she gets. Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left, and she trades them for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. In total, she has 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we can leave the answer in terms of small buttons.

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Since he wants to make 4 liters of juice, he will need 4 times the amount of oranges. 

4 liters * 5 kilograms/liter = 20 kilograms of oranges

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost will be:

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we know Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more. 
So, Ezra's total is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, she taught 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she taught less than 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount of money he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the amount of money he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:
Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the number of pencils he gave away.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 
1/2 of 50 is 25. So, he gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 
3/5 of 25 is (3/5) * 25 = 15. So, he gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost, we need to break down the movies into three categories: series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in each series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these series movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie in a series
Total cost of series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these remaining movies are older movies, which is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of these older movies is $5 each:
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of these normal movies is $10 each:
Total cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to find the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the distance they drove. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 * 4.5
Distance = 225 miles

Now, let's find the distance they hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:
Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance they hiked:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored. 

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points for enemies: 
Emma gets 10x points for enemies.
Ava gets 10(x + 8) points for enemies, which is 10x + 80 points.

Points for berries:
Emma gets 5y points for berries.
Ava gets 5(y + 3) points for berries, which is 5y + 15 points.

Points for time:
Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 't' seconds left. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so Ava has 't - 4' seconds left.
Emma gets 30t points for time.
Ava gets 30(t - 4) points for time, which is 30t - 120 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:
Emma's total points = 10x + 5y + 30t
Ava's total points = (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)
Ava's total points = 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

The difference between their scores = Ava's total points - Emma's total points
= (10x + 5y + 30t - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30t)
= -25

The difference between their scores is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract 60 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many times they ride their bikes a week, we need to calculate the total number of rides for both Chase and Rider.

They ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides for each of them. Since there are two people, the total number of rides for these 5 days is 15 rides/person * 2 people = 30 rides.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. For 2 days, that's 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides for each of them. For both people, that's 12 rides/person * 2 people = 24 rides.

Now, we add the total number of rides for the 5 days and the 2 days: 30 rides + 24 rides = 54 rides.

"Let's break down the information we have. Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

We know that Bob initially had 4 white fish, so the total number of white fish he has now is 4 + x.

We also know that Bob initially had 3 orange fish, so the total number of orange fish he has now is 3 + 2x.

The total number of fish Bob has now is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of fish:

(4 + x) + (3 + 2x) = 24

Combine like terms:

7 + 3x = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3 is not a whole number, but since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to re-evaluate the equation.

Let's re-evaluate the equation (4 + x) + (3 + 2x) = 24, considering that x must be a whole number.

7 + 3x = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Since 3x = 17 doesn't give a whole number, let's try to find a combination that works.

We know that Bob bought 17 fish in total. Let's try to find a combination of white and orange fish that adds up to 17 and satisfies the condition that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

If Bob bought 5 white fish, he would have 4 + 5 = 9 white fish in total. To have twice as many orange fish, he would need 18 orange fish. But he only had 3 initially, so he would need to buy 18 - 3 = 15 orange fish. This doesn't add up to 17.

If Bob bought 4 white fish, he would have 4 + 4 = 8 white fish in total. To have twice as many orange fish, he would need 16 orange fish. But he only had 3 initially, so he would need to buy 16 - 3 = 13 orange fish. This doesn't add up to 17.

If Bob bought 6 white fish, he would have 4 + 6 = 10 white fish in total. To have twice as many orange fish, he would need 20 orange fish. But he only had 3 initially, so he would need to buy 20 - 3 = 17 orange fish. This doesn't add up to 17.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses. 

Since the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the round trip (to and from work) is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

He drives to work from Monday to Friday, so the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since Carrie spent all the quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we multiply the number of twenties by 3/5, then multiply the result by the value of each twenty:
10 twenties * (3/5) = 6 twenties
6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

Number of eggplants = Number of eggplant plants * Number of eggplants per plant
Number of eggplants = 8 * 4
Number of eggplants = 32

Total number of fruits = Number of tomatoes + Number of eggplants
Total number of fruits = 110 + 32
Total number of fruits = 142

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total TVs sold are smart TVs. Since they sold 40 TVs, the number of smart TVs sold is 40 * (1/4) = 10.

One-eighth of the total TVs sold are analog TVs. The number of analog TVs sold is 40 * (1/8) = 5.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold. 

Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - Smart TVs - Analog TVs
= 40 - 10 - 5
= 25

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find out the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to reach 32 degrees.

Degrees to be raised = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the degrees to be raised by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs = 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups.

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Now, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find 3/5 of the groups, we multiply 10 by 3/5.

10 * 3/5 = 6 groups

Since each group has 9 people and each person brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of people per group and then by the number of seashells per person.

6 * 9 * 2 = 108

The final answer is: 108"

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month is:
260 employees * $4000 per month
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we need to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours they work.

Billy's starting wage was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a $0.50 raise, so his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another $1.00 raise, so his current wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so it's $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:
Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230
Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's say the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

Since the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we need to find the difference in the distances they traveled:
Distance between the cars = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
Distance between the cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between the cars = 20 miles

It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic. So, with 144 chips, he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be to cover 12 square inches. 

To find the length, we divide the total square inches by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Total quarts of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 
There are 10 quarts of tea left, so the total quarts of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long. So, they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, they will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long. So, he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.

Let's represent the amount of zest as 'x'. Since she uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, fragrance is also 'x'. 

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, salt is 2x. And since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, sugar is also 2x.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces

Combine like terms:

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of each color of eggs to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

The shipping cost is calculated by adding the cost per pound and the cost per mile. 
Cost per pound: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Cost per mile: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price.
Refund amount: 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose.
Total loss = Book cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24 + $3.00
Total loss = $11

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she had initially and then subtract the total cost of the items she bought.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost of the items she bought is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate how much he has produced in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we subtract the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production of the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
   18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 
   72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
   Convert hours to minutes: 
   8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

3. Time spent on makeup: 
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 
   90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Now, add up the time spent on each activity: 
288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes

The total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 1128 minutes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, and costs $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, but the initial installation only includes 4 mirrors, so she needs to install 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the initial installation only includes 1 chandelier, so she needs to install 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the initial installation only includes 10 pictures, so she needs to install 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation + the cost of the additional items = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we can add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to start with Pompei's ability and work our way up.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 1 * 12 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, we divide 18 hours by 3 to get the time for one kangaroo.

Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that it will take a turtle twice as long to travel the same distance as a kangaroo.

Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to find the total time it would take for all four turtles to travel across the highway. However, since they are traveling together, the time remains the same.

Time for four turtles = 12 hours

The price of the laptop after the trade-in discount is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam made and then subtract the slices he ate.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam sliced 3 large apples. So, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam sliced 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the slices from large and small apples to get the total number of slices: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam ate 15 slices, so we subtract 15 from the total number of slices to find out how many are left: 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to calculate how many liters of milk his current cows produce. 

He has 3 cows and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, 3 cows produce 3 * 5 = 15 liters of milk per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the production of one cow: 10 / 5 = 2.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
Since the original length is 12 mm, the used length is 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 
The used length is 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 
The used length is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length. 
Since there are three glue sticks, the total original length is 3 * 12 = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes. Since he collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack is $10 / 5 = $2 per pack.

Since the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per pack of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4 per pack. Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the information given. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it also includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long, its runtime without the encore would be 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime becomes 2x + 15.

We know that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month and then divide that by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles he drives in a month is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12/2 * $0.5 = 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

First, we know there are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Next, we add the number of boys and girls playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38.

Finally, we add the total number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer: 18 + 38 = 56.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost. 

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop. Since there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300 lollipops. The total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

Next, let's find the total cost. The total number of lollipops bought is also 300 (since they sold all the lollipops they bought). The total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea Lana used for chamomile and mint tea. We know she used 15 cups for cinnamon tea. 

Total cups of tea = 27
Cups of cinnamon tea = 15
Cups of chamomile and mint tea = Total cups of tea - Cups of cinnamon tea
Cups of chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15
Cups of chamomile and mint tea = 12

Since Lana divided the cups into 3 rows and created equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the total cups of chamomile and mint tea by 3 to find the total cups in each row, and then divide that by 2 to find the cups of mint tea in each row.

Total cups in each row = Cups of chamomile and mint tea / 3
Total cups in each row = 12 / 3
Total cups in each row = 4

Cups of mint tea in each row = Total cups in each row / 2
Cups of mint tea in each row = 4 / 2
Cups of mint tea in each row = 2

"To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to find out how much water was initially filled in the tank. 

Since the tank was filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool had 10000 gallons of water, the tank was filled with 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Now, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

So, after 6 days, the amount of water emptied from the tank will be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water. 

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $150 his parents gave him.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so that's 5 x $10 = $50.
He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so that's 8 x $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so that's 2 x $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so that's 4 x $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10.

So, the total cost for the night will be $10 (ticket) + $10 (popcorn and candy) = $20.

He can afford to see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so:
600 * 1/3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are:
200 * 200 = 40,000 calories

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so:
450 * 1/3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are:

Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Total number of days = 5.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write an equation:
L = J + 10

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
P = L + J

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

We also know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old:
P + L + J = 100

Substituting the first equation into this equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Substituting the second equation into this equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 
60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they own from the total number of tables they need.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information given.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder (9 emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

This means the remaining emails (not work or family) are 9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to first find Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can multiply Aliya's age by 3 to find Shawna's age.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. We can multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find Shawna's father's age.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract that from the number she reported.

Courtney reported 48 people. 
20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried. 

We know Jason carried 2 balls. 
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

We also know Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we can add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls: 
1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then multiply it by 4 to get the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, and on the third day, they dug 8 holes. However, they also filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.
3. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon.

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokémon each person has caught:
- Let A be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let S be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let D be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the information given:
A = S + 5
S = 4D - 13
A + S + D = 339

Substituting A from the first equation into the third equation:
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + D + 5 = 339

Substituting S from the second equation into the above equation:
2(4D - 13) + D + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8D - 26 + D + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9D - 21 = 339
Add 21 to both sides:
9D = 360
Divide by 9:
D = 40

Now that we know D, we can find S:
S = 4D - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 147."
"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to find the total number of episodes and multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the total number of episodes by dividing the minutes per episode by 2.

Total episodes = 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, we can multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total minutes John will spend watching the show.

Total minutes = 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first part of the journey: 
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last part of the journey:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to get the actual distance between the two homes:
Distance between homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. 
Now, subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 racquets. However, we also need to consider the hybrid sets, which are half synthetic gut. Since there are 4 hybrid sets, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 racquets worth of synthetic gut. So, the total time for synthetic gut is (3 + 2) * 15 minutes = 5 * 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. We also need to consider the hybrid sets, which are half polyester string. Since there are 4 hybrid sets, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 racquets worth of polyester string. So, the total time for polyester string is (5 + 2) * 22 minutes = 7 * 22 minutes = 154 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per set, and there are 4 sets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

However, we've already accounted for the time it takes to string the hybrid sets with synthetic gut and polyester string. So, we don't need to add the 72 minutes for hybrid sets.

The total time is 75 minutes (synthetic gut) + 154 minutes (polyester string) = 229 minutes.

"To find the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to find the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister.

She started with 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's a total of 4 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

So, she sold 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's multiply the total number of boxes by their respective costs:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old. 

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. To find his dad's current age, we subtract 5 years from 48. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. To find his brother's current age, we subtract 5 years from 12. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many spaces we can fit in the flower bed. Each space is 12 inches (the width of the flower) + 18 inches (1.5 feet converted to inches, the space between flowers). 

12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches per space

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the length of each space.

1332 inches / 30 inches per space = 44.4 spaces

Since we can't have a fraction of a space, we round down to 44 spaces. However, Pat already has 17 flowers, so we subtract those from the total number of spaces.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, then multiply that by the time it takes her to sauté one group.

90 / 30 = 3

Since it takes her 10 minutes to sauté one group of 30 shrimp, it will take her 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to sauté 90 shrimp.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write an equation: 
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants: 
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. There are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, her age (H) is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute H into the equation: 
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants: 
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides: 
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. So, the total amount collected from these sources is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match. 

The lawyer will donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. So, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. 

There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

So, the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices is 4x (for kids) + 2(2x) (for adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total number of slices is 8x, we can set up an equation to represent the whole watermelon: 8x = 1 (whole watermelon).

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets 2x, so we can divide 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract it from the serving time.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost per student, then multiply it by the number of days in a month the studio is rented.

The studio is rented 3 days a week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the studio is rented 3 * 4 = 12 days a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student is $1.50. There are 10 students. So the total cost per session is $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.

Now, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of days the studio is rented in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."

4 * 12 = 48

Now, we multiply the number of babies born per female porcupine in a year by the number of female porcupines:

48 * 30 = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born:

"To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 + 4125 = 13025 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 13025 = 4975 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the charge after 3 hours of losing 7% capacity per hour. If the charge remaining was 28% after that, we can set up an equation to find the charge before those 3 hours:

Let x be the charge before the 3 hours of losing 7% capacity per hour.
x - 3 * (7% of x) = 28%
x - 0.21x = 28%
0.79x = 28%
x = 28% / 0.79
x = 35.44%

Now, we know the charge before the 3 hours of losing 7% capacity per hour was 35.44%. Before that, the power bank was losing 9% capacity per hour for 5 hours. We can set up another equation to find the charge before those 5 hours:

Let y be the charge before the 5 hours of losing 9% capacity per hour.
y - 5 * (9% of y) = 35.44%
y - 0.45y = 35.44%
0.55y = 35.44%
y = 35.44% / 0.55
y = 64.43%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.43%.

40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total number of questions to find the rest.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned from the sales is $120. This amount is the sum of the money she earned from selling large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. 

The money she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $12 * x, and the money she earned from selling small stuffed animals is $4 * 2x. 

So, we can write the equation:

Combine like terms:
12x + 8x = 120
20x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 20:
x = 6

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will have. 

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle. 

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 more bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes him to move to each bottle. 

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes of apples and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total number of apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we know that Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples per pack
= 80 apples / 8 apples/pack
= 10 packs

"To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn is:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, we add 2 feet to the length and 2 feet to the width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we find the area of the fabric by multiplying the new length and new width.

Area = length * width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2.

Total area = 2 * 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than 85 is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
5 more than 204 is 204 + 5 = 209.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we'll subtract that from the total losses.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

There were 3 races in total. 

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as 'x'. Then the second person took 'x + 80', and the third person took '2(x + 80)'.

Since the total amount is $1920, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine 'x' terms and constants:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8: 21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 0.375 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x.
- The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 (since it's 4 more than the second set).
- The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2 (since it's half of the second set).

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can set up an equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms and multiply by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

First set = x + 4
First set = 6 + 4
First set = 10

Now, we know the number of English and German books. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she already has. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, she has 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10. 

80 / 10 = 8

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll find the discount amount and divide it by the original price, then multiply by 100.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:
60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour
3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs:
14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. Then, he walked 2 miles back home. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can divide the total distance by his walking speed to find the total time it took him to reach the store. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the two amounts.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, the cost would be 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.

If she bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.

Now, let's find out how much money she saved by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, we can calculate it as follows:
300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes

Now, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. 15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so we can calculate it as follows:
15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes

Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 (half the price of an MTB, which is $500) = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, let's subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate the total weekly minutes he spends in class and extra learning time. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes per week on extra learning time.

The total minutes he spends learning per week is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

6 * 12 = 72 inches

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child. 
72 + 2 = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. 
74 - 5 = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child. 
69 + 3 = 72 inches

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we know that the orchard sold 200 bags of apples. Since each bag costs $5, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the velociraptors must have left 270 kilograms. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the velociraptors must have started with the other half. This means that the original triceratops had 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are needed.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda) and 6 are unshaken (since 9 - 1 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas were left after Ellen and her brother took their sodas).

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply that by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

So, Billy works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total time spent on breaks per day is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Adding the lunch time, the total time spent per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 days: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement, which is $100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 per year. Since she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she needs to save a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which is $100,000 * 0.2 = $20,000 per year. 

To calculate how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she saves per year ($20,000).

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to first find out how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. So, we need to divide Sofie's total distance by 2 to find Brian's total distance. 

Brian's total distance = 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to find out how many toys the first four workers produce in total. 

Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
Two other workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 

So, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 

Since they work for 10 hours, they produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys. 

The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total, but they still need 20 more after the first four workers have finished their shift. This means the first four workers and the fifth worker together have produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys. 

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys. 

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to find the weight of Elijah's two dogs first. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs: Elijah's first dog (15 pounds) + Elijah's second dog (30 pounds) + Kory's dog (60 pounds) = 105 pounds.

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards. 

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. 

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before using half of them.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to first find out the total number of M&M's he has. 

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to first calculate half the circumference of the earth. 

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to divide the distance Alfie needs to fly (20,000 km) by the distance he flies in a day (400 km).

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
So, the 2nd fastest car can go 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the fastest car can go 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs painted is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) + $30,000 (mother) = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's first find her speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we can divide the distance by the time.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
Speed = 2 * (1/20 miles per minute)
Speed = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:
Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add all the blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total amount of water in the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is (4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40.

Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:
4 * 33 + 1 * x ≥ 40 * 5
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately.

Initially, there are 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470.

Initially, there are 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate.
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost of each sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers per day by 3:

13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost of each bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we multiply the number of bouquets per day by 12:

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers per day by 3:

84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we add the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

He buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 60% (or 0.6):
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Now, we calculate his total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks he sells by the selling price:
12 * 7 = $84

His total cost is the amount he spent on buying the rocks:
20 * 5 = $100

To find out how much money he loses, we subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene. But in this case, we can also consider that she can work on different scenes on different days. So, the total number of days will be the sum of the days for each type of scene, but we can also try to find the least common multiple or the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to find the least common multiple of the days for each type of scene or to try different combinations of scenes per day.

One way to do this is to first complete the large-sized scenes (9 days), then the medium-sized scenes (6 days), and finally the small-sized scenes (7 days). However, we can also try to complete the scenes in a different order or combination.

A more efficient way is to complete the scenes in the following order: 
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes
- 7 days for small-sized scenes
- 2 days for 10 large-sized scenes (out of 45)
- 7 days for the remaining 35 large-sized scenes is not possible in one day, so we can do 5 large-sized scenes per day for 7 days.

However, we can do 6 medium-sized scenes and 5 large-sized scenes in 6 days and 7 small-sized scenes in 7 days. Then we can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days.

So, the total number of days will be 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 days, but we can do better than this.

We can do 6 medium-sized scenes and 5 large-sized scenes in 6 days and 7 small-sized scenes in 7 days. Then we can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days, but we can do 7 small-sized scenes in one day and 6 medium-sized scenes in one day, so we can do 7 small-sized scenes and 6 medium-sized scenes and 5 large-sized scenes in 7 days and then do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days.

However, we can do 7 small-sized scenes and 6 medium-sized scenes and 5 large-sized scenes in 7 days and then do the remaining 10 large-sized scenes in 2 days.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Mason eats 5 carrots each day on weekends, so he eats 2 x 5 = 10 carrots on weekends.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of the two songs:

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120.

The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit earned is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required for 100% of one person's daily energy demand. 

Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles per person.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy demand of 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows.

Now, let's find out how many eggs each kid found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by the kids: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. So the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, John collects garbage from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. So, the total amount he makes in a week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40.

- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as 'x'. Then the length of the red rope is 4x, and the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The combined length of the 3 ropes is x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6x + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6x = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we need to find out how many pods we can get for $1. 
To do this, we divide the total number of pods by the cost of the box: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. Since each bill is $20, the total amount of money he has left is 20 * $20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money. So, he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk.

So, the chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. 
20% of 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch.

Since the teacher has 2.75 inches left, we need to find out how many 1-inch portions can fit into 2.75 inches, but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.

Let's subtract 2 inches from 2.75 inches to find out how much chalk can be used: 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many 1-inch portions can fit into 0.75 + 2 inches (since the teacher can use the chalk until it is 2 inches). 
0.75 + 2 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher uses 1 inch each day, we can divide 2.75 by 1 to find the number of days, but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to 2 days, but we also need to add 1 day for Monday.

2 + 1 = 3 days.

However, we also need to consider that the teacher has 0.75 inches left after 2 days, and he can use the chalk until it is 2 inches. 
So, we can add 1 more day.

3 + 1 = 4 days.

However, we also need to consider that the teacher will have 0.25 inches left after 4 days (2.75 - 2.5), and he cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, but he can use it when it is 2 inches. 
So, we cannot add 1 more day.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

= 8000 / 5 
= 1600 gallons

Now, we need to find the total cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that had passed the expiry date. 

Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = 1600 * $3.5 
= $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

First, let's find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy: 
$27000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

Now, let's find out the total number of books he can buy:
54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books.

Since he is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many apples Newton brought home, let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple to throw at the tree. So, he had 1 apple in his pocket.

2. After throwing the apple, 5 more apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put all but 1 in his pocket. This means he now has 1 (initial apple) + 4 (new apples) = 5 apples in his pocket.

3. Newton threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. He picked up all of these apples. Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket (from before) and 6 new apples, for a total of 5 + 6 = 11 apples.

So, Newton brought home 11 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags of coal he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, let's divide the total amount of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg):

850 kg / 50 kg = 17

So Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. Now, let's multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese slices each, so they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both how many snowballs he can make in an hour and how many melt in that time.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

So, Jay effectively makes 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs in an hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to divide the number of snowballs he wants (60) by the number of snowballs he effectively makes in an hour (12). 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to work backwards.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They also had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Since 75 bandages came from the third day's order, the remaining 78 - 75 = 3 bandages must have been left over from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.

So, the total bandages used in the first two days is 38 + 28 = 66 bandages. They had 3 bandages left over from the first two days. This means they had 66 + 3 = 69 bandages at the start of the first day, plus the 50 bandages they ordered on the first day.

Therefore, they started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages on the first day, plus the 50 bandages they ordered.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will receive an additional $10 for complete attendance.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We are given that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. 

The statement can be translated into an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, we subtract 8 from both sides: 
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'x':

"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. 
Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 * $0.25 = $4

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute.
Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 * $0.2 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Carly made 'x' cupcakes. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2.

We know that Carly's class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3.

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then the decrease in January.

The price in November was $40. 
In December, the price increased by 80%, so we need to find 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
80% of $40 is 0.8 * $40 = $32.
The price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so we need to find 50% of $72 and subtract it from the price in December.
50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36.
The price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie earns $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he earns:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he earns 75% of his standard rate, which is:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour
He has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so he earns:

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day. So, in one day, he travels 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km.

In 3 days, he travels 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered (3600 km).

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100

The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms. 
Time spent per classroom = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
Total time spent cleaning in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, 
Total time available = 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms on average:

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine how many books one bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so they can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the number of books one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she bought a total of 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so she will sell 60 eggs for 60 / 3 = 20 units of $1. The total revenue is 20 x $1 = $20.

Rose's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks. 

Cost per stick = Total cost / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = $15.00 / 30
Cost per stick = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100

The 4-legged animals have 15 * 4 = 60 legs. 

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs. 

Since each pair has 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to find the total number of blue and yellow blocks. There are 4 blue blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow blocks: 4 + 8 = 12.

We know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: The boat depreciated 30% of its original value of $9000.
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: The boat depreciated another 30% of its value after 1 year.
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = Value after 1 year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: The boat depreciated 20% of its value after 2 years.
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = Value after 2 years - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

The number of red candies is given as 54. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 54 * 2 = 108.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula.

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to find out how old he is now. 

First, we need to find James' age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is 9 years old now. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since John was 19 when James was born, and James is 18 now, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. So, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. 
Difference = Number of oranges peeled by Ana - Number of oranges peeled by Jane
= 20 - 15
= 5

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark got it for 80% off, so we need to find 80% of $400 and subtract it from the original price.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320
Discount = $320
Price Mark paid for the radiator = $400 - $320 = $80

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it took 3 hours to install the radiator.
Mechanic's labor cost = $50 * 3 = $150

Total cost Mark paid = Price of radiator + Mechanic's labor cost
Total cost Mark paid = $80 + $150
Total cost Mark paid = $230

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the total number of legs. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'n'. We know that c + n = 20 (total number of animals) and 2c + 4n = 70 (total number of legs).

We can solve the first equation for 'n': n = 20 - c.

Now, substitute 'n' in the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70.

Combine like terms: -2c + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2c = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: c = 5.

The number of chickens is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find out the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and 3 friends).

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

56 / 4 = 14"
