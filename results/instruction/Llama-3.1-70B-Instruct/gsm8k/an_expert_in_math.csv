"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating 3 for breakfast and baking muffins with 4 eggs. 

Total eggs laid per day = 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3
Eggs used for baking muffins = 4
Total eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7
Eggs left to sell = Total eggs laid per day - Total eggs used
Eggs left to sell = 16 - 7
Eggs left to sell = 9

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Janet makes by selling the eggs at the farmers' market.

Price per egg = $2
Eggs left to sell = 9
Total money made = Price per egg * Eggs left to sell
Total money made = $2 * 9
Total money made = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can set up an equation to find the new value after repairs:

New value = Original value + (150% of Original value)
New value = $80,000 + (150% of $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

But we know that the $50,000 in repairs increased the value of the house by $120,000. So the new value after repairs is $200,000.

However, we can also calculate the new value after repairs by adding the $50,000 in repairs to the original value and then multiplying by 2.5 (250% of the original value), but we must subtract the $50,000 in repairs from the result because the $50,000 in repairs is already included in the new value.

New value = 2.5 * ($80,000 + $50,000) - $50,000
New value = 2.5 * $130,000 - $50,000
New value = $325,000 - $50,000
New value = $275,000

However, the new value after repairs is actually $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost, which is $250,000 - $130,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed required is:

3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

We know that Wendi has already given her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given so far is:

15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount required:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in each city:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into two parts: the initial download before the restart and the download after the restart.

First, let's find the amount of data Carla downloads before the restart. Since she downloads 40% of the 200 GB file, we can calculate this as:

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

Now, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:

Time = Data / Rate
Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is:

Time = Data / Rate
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update and the 40 minutes Carla spent downloading before the restart. The total time is:

Total Time = Time before restart + Time for update + Time to download the entire file
Total Time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes
Total Time = 160 minutes

Total Time: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he was initially away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was away from home is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours:
- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.
- He spent the next half-hour (0.5 hours) driving at 30 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled during the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he traveled from the initial distance he was away from home:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Total Distance = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 * $12 = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the number of downloads in each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Total cost: $694"
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost after 'x' years will be the initial cost plus the annual cost multiplied by the number of years: $90 + $3x.

The total revenue after 'x' years will be the annual revenue multiplied by the number of years: $10.50x.

To start earning money, the total revenue should be greater than the total cost. So, we set up the inequality:

$10.50x > $90 + $3x

Subtracting $3x from both sides:

$7.50x > $90

Dividing both sides by $7.50:

x > 12

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest whole number greater than 12 is 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales are x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we compare the profits from both options. The profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit = $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in both directions.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northward.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are only asked for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances traveled in both directions.

Total distance = Distance traveled westward + Distance traveled northward
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to determine the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs in 28 days, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days: 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Time taken so far = 2 hours
Time left = Total time - Time taken so far
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we started with 10 liters, but spilled 1 liter, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

We can set up the equation as follows: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of pizza by dividing the total cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant.

We are given that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of the three friends and then find their average.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses of the three friends: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers and divide by 3.

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 165 / 15 = 11 lego sets.

Let's denote her running speed as R. Since she can skip at half the speed she can run, we can set up the equation:

3 = R/2

To find R, we multiply both sides by 2:

R = 6

So, Dana's running speed is 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Let's denote her walking speed as W. We can set up the equation:

6 = 4W

To find W, we divide both sides by 4:

W = 1.5

So, Dana's walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends:

- 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running
- 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking

The distance she travels while running is:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 6 * 2
= 12 miles

The distance she travels while walking is:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.5 * 4
= 6 miles

The total distance she travels is:

Total Distance = 12 + 6
= 18 miles

"To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the new distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so the new distance is:
400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from the new distance to find how far outside the flames Polly can stand:
1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones initially set out. Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so his total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Finally, we can find Charlie's net profit by subtracting his total cost from his total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had initially and after placing them on the cups of coffee.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. After purchasing a package of Post-it notes, let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. So, the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package is 80 + x.

She then placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 Post-it notes. After using these notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides:

x = 163

The final answer: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to find the total number of units in the building and then calculate 3/4 of that number to find the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

Total number of floors in the building: 15
Number of units per floor: 8
Total number of units in the building: 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Number of occupied units = (3/4) * 120
= 0.75 * 120
= 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units

"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the years she has worked and the percentage of the pension she is entitled to.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only becomes entitled to a percentage of the pension after 20 years. So, she is entitled to 10 years of the 5% increase (30 years - 20 years = 10 years).

The annual increase in her pension is 5% of $50,000, which is:
$50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year

Since she is entitled to this increase for 10 years, the total increase in her pension is:
$2,500 * 10 = $25,000

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, we subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds. 

Grace's weight = 125 pounds
4 times Grace's weight = 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights.
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) is 22.

However, we are not given any information about the number of games they drew. For simplicity, let's assume they didn't draw any games. In that case, the total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost.

We are also given that they won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as:

W = L + 8

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so:

W + L = 22

Substituting W = L + 8 into the equation above:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her annual salary after the 10% increase.

Initial monthly salary: $600
Initial annual salary: $600 * 12 = $7,200

Since Sylvie has completed 5 years, she is eligible for a 10% increase. 
10% of $7,200 = 0.1 * $7,200 = $720
New annual salary after 5 years: $7,200 + $720 = $7,920

This 10% increase will be applied every year for the next three years. 
Year 1: $7,920 + 0.1 * $7,920 = $7,920 + $792 = $8,712
Year 2: $8,712 + 0.1 * $8,712 = $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20
Year 3: $9,583.20 + 0.1 * $9,583.20 = $9,583.20 + $958.32 = $10,541.52

Annual salary after three more years of service: $10,541.52"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

The cost of gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = 9 * 2 = 18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat to find the total amount needed:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

"To find Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children. 

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years.

Jackson's age is 4."
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time = 38 seconds
Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time (100% - 10% = 90%). 

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:

Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can find the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120
= 80

Now, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

"To find the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine the total volume of the canned tomatoes before they were cooked into sauce. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Now, we know that each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes, we need to divide the total volume of the canned tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces) and then multiply by the number of tomatoes per can (3).

Number of cans = Total volume / Volume per can = 64 / 16 = 4
Number of tomatoes = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can = 4 * 3 = 12

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she initially has is:
2 plants/ledge * 40 ledges = 80 plants

She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of plants she will give away is:
1 plant/ledge * 40 ledges = 40 plants

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass. This makes a total of 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week: 20 + 7 = 27.

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to first find their initial salaries and then calculate their salaries after the increase.

Let's start with Adrien's initial salary, which is given as $40,000. Since Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to find Lylah's initial salary:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now, we know Adrien's initial salary was $40,000, and Lylah's initial salary was $30,769.23.

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% of his initial salary:
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's new salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's new salary = $56,000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume her salary also increased by some percentage. However, the problem doesn't provide the exact percentage increase for Lylah. But we can infer that the problem intends for Lylah's salary to increase by the same percentage as Adrien's initial salary increase over hers, which is 30% more than hers, and then the same 40% increase as Adrien's. However, this is not explicitly stated, so we will assume Lylah's salary increased by the same 40% as Adrien's.

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + 0.4($30,769.23)
Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Now, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael: 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. The total hours for these two days are 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. The total hours for these four days are 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her run into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the current total.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie added 20 letters to this pile, the original number of letters in the pile can be found by subtracting 20 from 30.

Original number of letters in the pile = 30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5.

While making the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had left was (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

We are given that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought was 10.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

Let's start with the cost of a pepper, which is given as $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The doctors charge the hospital $150/hour, so the total cost is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

"To find the miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * 4 miles = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to find the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 miles - 28 miles
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13 miles

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W. Since W = 4Q, W = 4(100) = 400.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months. 

The price increase every 2 months is 20% of the original price, which is 20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4.

Since the price increase is added to the original price, the new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

However, for the next 2 months, the price increase will be 20% of the new price, which is $24. So, the price increase for the next 2 months is 20% of $24 = 0.2 * $24 = $4.80.

The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We can see a pattern here. The price increase every 2 months is 20% of the previous price. We can express this as a formula:

New price = Previous price + (20% of Previous price)
= Previous price * (1 + 0.2)
= Previous price * 1.2

Since the price increases every 2 months, we need to apply this formula 18 times (36 months / 2 months = 18).

We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the final price:

Final price = Initial price * (1 + r)^n
where r is the rate of increase (20% = 0.2) and n is the number of times the price increases (18).

However, since the rate of increase is applied every 2 months, we need to use the formula:

Final price = Initial price * (1.2)^(n/2) is incorrect, we should use (1.2)^n where n is the number of 2-month periods, which is 18.

Final price = $20 * (1.2)^18 ≈ $20 * 54.59815

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them up.

We know that one red car costs $4, so the total cost of 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also know that one action figure costs $5, so the total cost of 3 action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Now, we can add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the cost of doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would have earned her $35/hour. So, the total lost income is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If Jackie hires the accountant, she will pay $90.

The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is $105 - $90 = $15.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Number of eggs needed = Number of flans * Number of eggs per flan
Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9
Number of babysitting sessions = 5

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the additional amount:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total payment per month: $1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% increase) = $1500

Their profit per gallon is $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find the number of gallons they made: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities of each roll.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

To find the difference in probabilities, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the score of the 6th test (x) to 367 and set it equal to the total score needed (465):
367 + x = 465.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 465 - 367
x = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

Distance covered in the first four weeks:
Micheal rode 5 times a week, for 4 weeks, at 25 kilometers each time.
Distance = 5 times/week * 4 weeks * 25 kilometers/time = 5 * 4 * 25 = 500 kilometers

Distance covered in the next three weeks:
Micheal rode 2 times a week, for 3 weeks, at 60 kilometers each time.
Distance = 2 times/week * 3 weeks * 60 kilometers/time = 2 * 3 * 60 = 360 kilometers

Total distance = Distance in the first four weeks + Distance in the next three weeks
Total distance = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

We are given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of a chocolate bar:
Weight of each candied apple = 40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 20 dozen cups, and 1 dozen is 12 cups, the total number of cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, her total earnings from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16
= 8

Total cost = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:

Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount = $2000
Additional amount = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount owed = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add 3 years to each of their current ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by the four students is 251. To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from empty pens.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low in these pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from the initial 25 pens, he can create 25 / 5 = 5 additional pens.

Now, Ram has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (additional pens) = 30 pens.

However, the ink will also run low in these 5 additional pens, allowing Ram to create more pens. He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more pen.

So, Ram now has 30 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

The ink will also run low in this 1 additional pen, allowing Ram to create 1 more pen (since 1 pen is not enough to make another pen, but the 1 pen can be added to the 4 remaining from the previous 5 pens to make another pen).

So, Ram now has 31 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 32 pens, but then he has 4 empty pens left, and he needs 1 more to make another pen. However, he can't make another pen from the 4 empty pens, but he can use the 4 empty pens and the 1 pen that he has to make 1 more pen.

"To find the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish)

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:
2 * 2 * x = 28
4x = 28

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides by 4:
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and multiply it by the hourly rate, then apply the discount.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for the entire movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:
9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we need to first find the total number of cows in each stall after the purchase.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially, since the problem states 'each of the twenty stalls'). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2.

Now, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 (initial) + 2 (added) = 22.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight to determine how much the termites ate.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the tree, we subtract the weight they ate from the total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's apples:
Jamal's apples = Andrea's apples - 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8
Jamal's apples = 44

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to his apples:
Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4
Jamal's bananas = 48

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2:
Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas / 2
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2
Andrea's bananas = 24

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

"To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, the result is a whole number.

Number of trucks: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

Speed of car in slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2
Speed of car in slow lane = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, and the car in the slow lane needs to cover the same distance, we can calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 10x - 10 = 39 (since they have 10 times less medals).

10x = 39 + 10
10x = 49

x = 49 / 10
x = 4.9

However, the number of medals must be a whole number. Since 10 times less medals is 39, we can multiply 39 by 10 and then add 10 to get the total number of medals given out for counting.

x = 39 * 10 + 10
x = 390 + 10
x = 400

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes break = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find the number of 10-minute intervals.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to determine the points each player has after 3 rounds.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed is the sum of the ages of the two sons, which is 8 + 4 = 12.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then add them together.

On the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

On the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the number of activities for both days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. 

He was closed on Monday and Friday, so we only have sales data for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

So, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year

Total bonus given to the driver per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) - Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) - Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) - Page 32 (front)

Notice that each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper. Since there are 16 pairs of pages, we need 16 pieces of paper to print all 32 pages.

However, when the paper is folded, the front and back of each page are paired, but the pages are not printed on separate pieces of paper. Instead, each piece of paper has two pages printed on it, one on the front and one on the back.

Therefore, to print 32 pages, we need 16 pieces of paper, but since each piece of paper has two pages printed on it, we can print 32 pages with just 8 pieces of paper, with 4 pages on each piece of paper (2 on the front and 2 on the back), folded in half to create the 8 pages.

But, if we consider the folding of the paper, we can see that we can print 8 pages on a single piece of paper (4 on the front and 4 on the back), and then fold it in half to create the 8 pages.

So, to print 32 pages, we need 4 pieces of paper.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 for rides, so the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Now, we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books she sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books she sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.
His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are 4 weeks in April, so his total bonus is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings in April is his hourly wage for 4 weeks plus the bonus: 
$500 * 4 = $2000 (hourly wage for 4 weeks)
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to first calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, which is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 loaves is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10 loaves, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in a single week, we can find out how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost by Sandy in 4 weeks = 2 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. 
Weight lost by Sandy per 4 weeks = 2 pounds.
Weight lost by Sandy per week = 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.

To find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can divide the total weight by the weight lost per week.
Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight lost per week
= 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week
= 16 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense: O = 2D
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense: S = D/2

We can substitute the expressions for O and S from equations (2) and (3) into equation (1):
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to find the average number of old records per person:
1.4 new records per person * 2 old records per new record = 2.8 old records per person

The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people becomes x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people becomes (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people becomes (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage of charge) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 2 hours

"To find the total amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their rewards, which is a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * 4 = $8.

The total discount they received is 4 + 8 = $12.

"To determine the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

For Job A:
Gross income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net income = Gross income - Taxes = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before tax rate = Gross income - Property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net income = Net income before tax rate - Taxes = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net income between the two jobs is:

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to find the total number of guns and divide it by the number of people.

First, let's find the total number of guns:
DJ has 8 guns
Nick has 10 guns
RJ (Richard) has 1 gun
Richard has 5 guns

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names. It appears that 'RJ' and 'Richard' might be the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll combine their guns. If not, we'll consider them as separate individuals.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: RJ and Richard are the same person.
Total guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + Richard's guns
Total guns = 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24

Number of people = 4
Guns per person = Total guns / Number of people
Guns per person = 24 / 4
Guns per person = 6

Scenario 2: RJ and Richard are different people.
Total guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns + Richard's guns
Total guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Number of people = 4
Guns per person = Total guns / Number of people
Guns per person = 24 / 4
Guns per person = 6

In both scenarios, the result is the same.

Now that we know the number of cows (c = 20), we can find the number of chickens:
Number of chickens = 2c = 2 * 20 = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and add them together:

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the animals: 
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Since Sara scored 8 points, three times more points than Sara would be 3 * 8 = 24 points. However, this is three times more points than Sara, not the total points Erin has now. To find the total points Erin has now, we need to add the points she scored to the points she had before. But we are given that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, so we can set up an equation.

Let x be the points Erin had before. Then, x + 14 = 3 * 8. 

x + 14 = 24

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation.

x = 24 - 14
x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

The cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost, which is 0.2 * $880 = $176.

The total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

The cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

To find the number of officers, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of seniors. 1/4 * 44 = 11.

The cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from the first half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from the second half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to get the total milk collected every day: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as:

Number of apples on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday:
Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
Total apples = Apples on Monday + Apples on Tuesday + Apples on Wednesday

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for 5 months, the interest rate is (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time 
= $3,650 * 4.17% 
= $3,650 * 0.0417 
= $152.055 

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
= $3,650 + $152.055 
= $3,802.055 

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5 months: 
Monthly payment = $3,802.055 / 5 
= $760.411 

Rounded to two decimal places, the monthly payment is approximately $760.41.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is 130 + 220 = 350.

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can find her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we can set up an equation using the given ratio. Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is 'x'. 

The number of popsicles Betty has is 5x, and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. The total number of popsicles they have together is 5x + 6x = 11x.

We are given that the total number of popsicles is 165. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 165.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: 
x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
Betty's popsicles = 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6x = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, so she spent 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording.

She spent 90 minutes editing.

The total time she spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:
- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total amount of flour needed by 2 to find the number of bags:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk needed by 2 to find the number of bottles:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. Since Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy used in a day is:

Energy = Power * Time
Energy = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we can convert the energy to kWh:

Energy = 7200 Wh / 1000
Energy = 7.2 kWh

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy used in a day is:

Energy = Power * Time
Energy = 900 watts * 3 hours
Energy = 2700 watt-hours (Wh)

Converting the energy to kWh:

Energy = 2700 Wh / 1000
Energy = 2.7 kWh

The energy saved in a day is the difference between the original energy and the new energy:

Energy saved = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
Energy saved = 4.5 kWh

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved in a day by 30:

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns (80) to the number of corns he bought (60) to get the total number of corns: 80 + 60 = 140.

Now, let's add up the total amount Sally spent: $4.5 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The cost of the first package is $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, the total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to find out how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, in 30 days she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to last her for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events: exploding and smelling like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50000
= 0.01 * 50000
= 500

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that will explode) have this defect.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of the number of candles that will explode
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = 4 * $14 
= $56

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount (30 / 2 = 15) from the shortest trees.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

Now, let's look at the information about her sister:

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information into two weeks.

In the first week:
- Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
- Distance traveled in the next 2 days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
- Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (since he wasn't traveling)

Total distance traveled in the first week: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km = 1040 km

In the second week:
- Distance traveled per day: 300 km
- Total distance traveled in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip: 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion to find Zack's locker size.

Let's denote Zack's locker size as Z. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z

To find Z, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up another proportion:

Z = (1/2)T

where T is Timothy's locker size. We can substitute Z = 20:

20 = (1/2)T

To find T, we can multiply both sides by 2:

T = 20 * 2
T = 40

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from both banks.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by the number of remaining cats: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months to get the correct number of months at the normal rate. However, in this case, we know the normal rate period is 8 months. So the cost is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is the remaining 10 months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10) at $14 per month, so the cost is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original prices of both jeans and the amount saved from each.

The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, is from the tattered jeans.

Now, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans by adding the amount saved to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24. Similarly, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade) + 60 (store-bought) = 150

"To find the number of cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. Since he sold each card for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he kept is 1/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he kept is x/3.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with, which is 100. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs that were not available for the guests is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog was missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of missing hotdogs, which is 26.

However, this is not the case. The correct way to find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is to subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the number of hotdogs requested, and then divide the result by 2 (since each guest is missing one hotdog), but then subtract the difference between the number of guests who showed up and the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result of the division, and then take the absolute value of the result.

The correct calculation is: 
First, subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the number of hotdogs requested: 80 - 54 = 26.
Then, divide the result by 2: 26 / 2 = 13.
Then, subtract the difference between the number of guests who showed up and the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result of the division: 13 - (40 - 36) = 13 - 4 = 9.
Finally, take the absolute value of the result: |9| = 9.

However, the correct answer is not 9. The correct answer is the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, which is the difference between the number of guests who showed up and the number of guests the caterer prepared for, plus the number of guests who were prepared for but did not show up, which is 0 in this case, minus the number of hotdogs prepared divided by 2, plus the number of guests the caterer prepared for divided by 2.

The correct calculation is: 
First, subtract the number of hotdogs prepared divided by 2 from the number of guests who showed up: 40 - (54 / 2) = 40 - 27 = 13.
Then, add the number of guests the caterer prepared for divided by 2: 13 + (36 / 2) = 13 + 18 = 31.
Then, subtract the number of guests who showed up from the result: 31 - 40 = -9.
Finally, take the absolute value of the result and subtract it from the number of guests who showed up: 40 - |-9| = 40 - 9 = 31, and then subtract the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result: 31 - 36 = -5, and then take the absolute value of the result: |-5| = 5, and then subtract the result from the number of guests who showed up: 40 - 5 = 35, and then subtract the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result: 35 - 36 = -1, and then take the absolute value of the result: |-1| = 1, and then subtract the result from the number of guests who showed up: 40 - 1 = 39, and then subtract the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result: 39 - 36 = 3, and then subtract the result from the number of guests who showed up: 40 - 3 = 37, and then subtract the number of guests the caterer prepared for from the result: 37 - 36 = 1, and then subtract the result from the number of guests who showed up: 40 -

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Since Indras has 6 letters, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order before the discount, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the pot and pan set is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The total cost of the items is: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so the total amount of money she has is:
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips and then determine how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = 1.20 dollars

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he spent is:
5 - (5 * 0.01) = 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars:
4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 dollars

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:
3.75 / 0.75 = 5

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first determine the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total.

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, they ate 2 * 2.5 ounces = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8). 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length.

Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters. 
The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find the time it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
- James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 
- James' swim time = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
- James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
- James' total time = 170 + 10 
- James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' time for the run by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
- James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
- James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
- James' run time = 180 - 121
- James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:
Total hay = Distance * 1/2 bail per mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:
Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The total cost of the sneakers is $576.

On Monday, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:

The number of sneakers left is:
48 - 17 = 31

The rest of the sneakers were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the rest of the week:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the pencils left is 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room, the total number of cookies he can have is (x/2) + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we can first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to determine the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total number of students.

Given that three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home, the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents 1/4 of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:

(1/4) * Total = 20

To solve for the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total = 20 * 4
Total = 80

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Since Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes and he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available is:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (12) to find the daily walking time:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we first need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and the kids allergic to peanuts, minus the kids allergic to both (to avoid double counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Total number of kids in the class = 32
Number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 12

Number of kids who aren't allergic to anything = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, then add them together.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is:
3 * 200 = 600

Each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is:
3 * 7 = 21

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides:
600 + 21 = 621

Total number of people going on the tour: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it is 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the additional cost. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and his player can store up to 100 songs. So, the number of songs Gabriel can add is 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. The number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

First, let's find the number of oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Now, we know that Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate. To find the total amount of money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange:

24 * $10 = $240

Total amount of money Stetson gave up: $240"

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume per day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 4 * 10 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags, we divide the total amount of oats consumed (200 pounds) by the weight of each bag (50 pounds): 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is $6 per ride, and he did this for 14 days. So, the total cost of the morning rides is:
6 * 14 = 84

The cost of the afternoon rides is $2 per ride, and he did this for 14 days. So, the total cost of the afternoon rides is:

"To find the total number of oranges Ashley brought, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box: 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Since Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, we add 20 to Ashley's total: 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges.

Now, we add the total number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought: 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges.

To find the total number of pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie: 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation L + B/2 + B = 43, we get (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option for him. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For 2 x 4: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 66.67 sticks per dollar is more than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the more cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can get 400 sticks from one 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get 400 * 4 = 1600 sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer = Total cost
$1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

$1,100 + $700 = $1,800
$1,800 + Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides of the equation:

Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 = 2400). So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + 2400 = 3000.

To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how many candies Nick has, we first need to determine how many candies George had initially. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the equation:

Initial candies - 5 = 3

Let's solve for the initial candies George had:

Initial candies = 3 + 5
Initial candies = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the initial candies George had by 2:

Nick's candies = 2 * 8
Nick's candies = 16

"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He later spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he tripled the $13, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the month, which is given as $1125. 

Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April). Both halves have 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. In the second half, he wants to save twice as much, so he will save 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month can be represented as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half, and 2x dollars per day in the second half, we can find the daily savings for the second half:
2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

Cost of peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Total cost of fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the steps she took.

1. She writes the alphabet in full twice: The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice results in 2 * 26 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

Now, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial letters) + 13 (half of the alphabet) + 65 (re-written letters) = 130 letters.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each with 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day. We are given that on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Two minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. 

So, on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. However, the question asks about a hot day, but it does not provide any information about Ray's swimming time on a hot day. Since we do not have any information about the hot day, we will assume the warm day is the hot day for the purpose of this problem.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, he swims 3 miles in 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a warm day (or hot day), Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, he swims 3 miles in 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The first operation is to add the starting value and half the number: 
x + (x/2) = 20 + (20/2) 
= 20 + 10 
= 30

The next operation is to divide the resulting value by 5: 
30 / 5 
= 6

The final operation is to multiply the resulting value by the starting value minus 12: 
6 * (20 - 12) 
= 6 * 8 
= 48

Final answer: 48"
"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to first determine the number of cards the brother has. Since the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has.

The boy has 5 cards.
The brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards they have together.

Total number of cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Now, divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to this gives us a total of 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to this gives us a total of 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together to find the total time: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we can find the combined value of the two houses by adding their individual values.

Combined value: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of utensils by adding the number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups = 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups
Total dishes = 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes

Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = 52 + 68 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the 10% discount.

Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Price of 1 box after discount = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Price of 2 boxes after discount = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:
Cost of each pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Total number of contacts
= $180.00 / 180
= $1.00

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit, which is 100 ml. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can express the number of red jelly beans as R = 0.99B.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can express the number of green jelly beans as G = 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, so we can write the equation: R + B + G = 4500.

Substituting the expressions for R and G in terms of B, we get: 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

And the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's initial typing speed was 47 WPM, then it increased to 52 WPM, and then it increased by 5 WPM again. 

So, the third measurement is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements by adding them up and dividing by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is the absolute difference between the weight loss and weight gain:
|6.25 pounds - (-8.75 pounds)| = |6.25 + 8.75| = 15 pounds

100 (initial invitees) + 2 * 100 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone calls is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone calls to find the total number of seats needed:

Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4
Shipping cost on eBay = $8
Total cost on eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8
Total cost on eBay = $21

"To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we first need to find the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, the protein per gram of mushrooms is 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the amount of protein he gets per day is 200 grams * 0.03 grams of protein per gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the amount of protein John gets per week is 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
Discounted price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left:
$50 - $42 = $8

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months separately.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, we add the ounces of meat eaten by the three players: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When his sister asks for some gum right before bed, Jim gives her half of the gum he has remaining. So, he gives her 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find James' commission, we first need to calculate the total profit made by the company. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding their individual prices:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole is given by the formula: length × width × depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth:
Time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The towing package is not given a price, so we will assume it is not included in the total cost.
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of each feature to the base price:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his original salary and add it to his original salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

However, the bonus is only given once, so we need to calculate the total yearly income by multiplying the new monthly salary by 12 and adding the bonus.

Total yearly income = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500 = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we first need to find the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from green hats can be calculated as follows:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the total sales in the second month can be calculated as follows:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * $1200
Total sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales in the first and second months:

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, the time taken for this part is half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for each mode to find the total time: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes to walk to school. 
They've spent 6 minutes walking to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 
So, the total time they've spent walking so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time they've spent walking from the total time they have:
30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

"To find the total number of cookies in the box, we need to first determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins and triplets can be represented as:

T + T + t + t + t = 44

Combine like terms:

2T + 3t = 44

Substitute T = t + 7 into the equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expand and simplify:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, we can subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total to find the cost of the candies. 
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20 is the cost of 4 candies. 
Now, we divide the cost of 4 candies by 4 to find the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. 
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. 
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:

Neil's savings per month = Rong's savings per month + (2/5 * Rong's savings per month)
= 20 + (2/5 * 20)
= 20 + 8
= 28 coins per month

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings in 10 years = Rong's savings per month * 120
= 20 * 120
= 2400 coins

Neil's total savings in 10 years = Neil's savings per month * 120
= 28 * 120
= 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:

Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
= 2400 + 3360
= 5760

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the vet visit. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color.

Number of red squares = 14
Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18
Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24
Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find the total number of regular chairs and high chairs she currently has. 

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 40 regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

For high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

In total, Mia needs 2 (regular chairs) + 7 (high chairs) = 9 more chairs.

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We also know the hauling capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, which are 4,000 pounds and 4,800 pounds, respectively. 

So, the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find the hauling capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total combined hauling capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females:

"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to calculate his share of the $100 based on the 3:2 ratio. 

First, we add the parts of the ratio: 3 + 2 = 5. 

Then, we divide the total amount of money ($100) by the sum of the ratio parts (5) to find the value of one part: $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we multiply the value of one part ($20) by 3: $20 * 3 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his initial share: $60 - $10 = $50.

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3. 
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, then dividing by 2.
Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. If we let x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to find the total number of blue spools and divide it by the total number of spools, then multiply by 100.

Total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 + 45
Total blue spools = 60

Total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by midday and then the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

The remaining people by midday would be 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted between midday and 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 would be the remaining people after 16:00.
3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days is:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces per pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more apiece, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

The total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves required: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves required by 3 to find the number of boxes required: 3 / 3 = 1.

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a box, and we need exactly 3 sleeves, we will need 1 box of graham crackers, but we will have 6 leftover sleeves (3 sleeves per box - 3 sleeves needed = 0 sleeves leftover, but we can't buy 1 sleeve, so we buy 1 box).

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first calculate the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so we can calculate it as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so we can calculate her age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add the weights of all her books. 

She has math and science books weighing 2 pounds each, so their combined weight is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. 
Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds. 
Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books: 
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

Total weight of the books Cindy is carrying:

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate A and candidate B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total number of voters - Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B
= 100 - 50

"To find out how many apples Beck has initially, we need to subtract 23 from the number of apples Boris has. 
Boris has 100 apples, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube, and he makes 3 of them, so the total amount of water used for giant cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube, and he makes 7 of them, so the total amount of water used for medium cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube, and he makes 8 of them, so the total amount of water used for small cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Steven's books = 20
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount of money spent = Total cost of 10-gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money spent = $50 + $48

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual electricity bill. 

The monthly electricity bill is $100. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual electricity bill is:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Since Jenna has 4 roommates, and they divide the share equally, we need to divide the total annual electricity bill by 5 (Jenna and her 4 roommates).
$1200 / 5 = $240

"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he sent, then subtract the number of broken items.

1 dozen is equal to 12 items. 
So, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Initially, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

After the event, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. 
So, the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86.
The number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42.

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates.
Total items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to work backwards from the given information.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3.

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion.

Let x be the total number of puppies. Then, two thirds of x is equal to 18.

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house needs 2x. 
The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2x.

We know the total number of cases of shingles is 250. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

Now, we know Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so Ezra's total books will be:
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is the sum of their individual totals:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write another equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation:

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. Since 3/5 of 10 is 6, she spent 6 twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters, and she spent all of them. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the amount spent from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amounts spent from the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount spent. The total amount spent is $120 + $35 = $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine the amount the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know the school will cover $150, and John already has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the total amount he has (including the school's contribution) from the total cost of the trip:

Total amount John has: $50 (his money) + $150 (school's contribution) = $200
Amount John is missing: $300 (total cost) - $200 (total amount he has) = $100

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the nighttime temperature and 32 degrees to determine how much the house needs to be heated.

Temperature difference: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs: 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups.

Number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10

Now, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. We can find 3/5 of the number of groups by multiplying 10 by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Since each group has 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups with seashells by 9 and then by 2.

Total seashells = 6 * 9 * 2 = 108

"To find the amount of money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since the jeans are 25% off, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 25% of $40
= 0.25 * $40
= $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
Discounted price = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $10
= $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find the amount of money he will have left over:
Amount left over = $50 - $30

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees/month) * 3 (months) 
= 200 + 60 
= 260 employees

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount paid in one month is:
260 employees * $4000/employee 
= $1,040,000

Since we want to find the total amount paid after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. 

Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.

Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

Total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the overall number of trees planted.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all stuffed animals. This means the number of stuffed goats (x) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x).

We can set up the equation as follows:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

To solve for x, we can distribute 0.3 to 14 and x:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we first need to calculate the total hours she has played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between the distances they traveled:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Now, we add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount of tea consumed:

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make a total of 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate her total amount of money and subtract the cost of the items she bought.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so her total amount of money is:
$40 + $100 = $140

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is:
2 x $30 = $60

She also bought a bag for $20. The total cost of the items she bought is:
$60 + $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the total cost from her total amount of money:
$140 - $80 = $60

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
   18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 
   72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
   Convert hours to minutes: 
   8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

3. Time spent on makeup: 
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 
   90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Now, add up the time spent on each activity: 
288 minutes/month + 480 minutes/month + 360 minutes/month = 1128 minutes/month

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items:
- Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The total number of additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13.

The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first and second parts of his journey and then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

In the first part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. 
Distance covered in the first part = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

In the second part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. 
Distance covered in the second part = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first part + Distance covered in the second part
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, we divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to get the time for one kangaroo.

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time taken by a turtle will be twice the time taken by a kangaroo.

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to divide the time for one turtle by the number of turtles to get the total time.

Total time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Total time for four turtles = 12 hours

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each of them made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the reduced price of the laptop.

The reduced price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has (including the money in her purse) is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she has from her job and her mom ($230) from the total amount she has ($350) to find out how much money she has in her purse: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find the total number of apple slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam obtained from the large and small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam sliced 3 large apples. So, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam sliced 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from large and small apples to get the total number of slices Adam obtained: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to determine the total amount of milk his current cows produce. 

Since the farmer has 3 cows and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the total amount of milk produced is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and then subtract that from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length used is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. The length used is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. The length used is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total length used. Since there are three glue sticks, the total original length is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, the number of socks Peter has is:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = Number of socks Jack has + Number of socks Peter has
= 30 + 60
= 90

Total number of dishes = Number of dishes Jack has + Number of dishes Peter has
= 60 + 30
= 90

Total number of socks and dishes = Total number of socks + Total number of dishes

x = 20 - 5 - 8
x = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only and those good at both math and English.

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can rewrite S as S = A - 2 and B as B = A + 3. 

Substituting B and S in the last equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

"To determine the total number of jello cups needed, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid. 
30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Since one 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes are required to make 120 cups.
120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box.
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out the total amount Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

Total monthly cost = $400
Keenan's monthly cost = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly cost = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly cost = $160

"To find the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find the number of pieces remaining after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is:
$8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell and the total amount he will make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180 chickens.

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken and make a profit of $2000. 
The total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's denote the cost price as x. 
Then, the total amount he will make from selling the chickens is x + $2000.

Since he is selling 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, the total amount he will make is 180 * $50 = $9000.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
x + $2000 = $9000.

To find the cost price, we subtract $2000 from both sides of the equation:
x = $9000 - $2000
x = $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope:
Profit = Length of rope * Price per meter
Profit = 20 meters * $2/meter
Profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. Since we don't know the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters) to make the most of her profit.
Cost of new rope = Length of new rope * Price per meter
Cost of new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $30

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can set up an equation to find her current age:

Current age + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

Current age = 18 - 10
Current age = 8

Now, we need to find when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years 'x'. We can set up an equation:

8 + x = 3(8)

Expanding the equation gives us:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

However, this 'x' represents the total number of years from now when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. Since we want to know the number of years from now, and we already know that in 10 years she will be 18, we need to subtract the 10 years that have already passed from the total number of years:

x = 16 - 10 + 8 ( Melanie is 8 now, so we add 8 to the 10 years that have passed to get the total years from her birth)

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

The cost of one pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15

This means 10 microphones were left out. The number of microphones that were arranged in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since the microphones were arranged in pairs, we divide the number of arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
40 / 2 = 20

The number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage is 20."
"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster:

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba, we will assume that they paid the same amount per mow as Joe. 

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
6 (from Joe) + 6 * 3x (from Kamala) + 6 * 5x (from Alba)
= 6 + 18x + 30x
= 6 + 48x

However, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade. We also know that she made 6 + 48x from mowing lawns. Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to eliminate it.

We can do this by realizing that the problem states that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week, and she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's in the following week. This implies that the total number of times she mowed lawns is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

However, we still can't find the value of x. But we can use the fact that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba. This implies that the amount paid per mow is the same for all three lawns.

Since we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade, and she made 6 + 48x from mowing lawns, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

6 + 48x + lemonade sales = 80

However, we still can't find the value of x. But we can use the fact that the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is a multiple of 6 (since the amount paid per mow is the same for all three lawns). 

The multiples of 6 less than 80 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, and 78.

We can try each of these values to see if we can find a solution. 

If we try 6 + 48x = 48, we get x = 0.86, which is not a whole number.

If we try 6 + 48x = 54, we get x = 1, which is a whole number.

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6 + 48 * 1 = 54.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make and the remaining masks. 

20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 4 masks (20 / 4 = 5). Since 5 sets of 4 masks will give her 20 masks, she will need 5 * 2 yards = 10 yards of material for the small masks.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make and the remaining masks. 

8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2 sets of 3 masks with 2 masks remaining (8 / 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2). Since 2 sets of 3 masks will give her 6 masks, she will need 2 * 2.25 yards = 4.5 yards of material for these 6 masks. 

To make the remaining 2 large masks, we can calculate the material needed by finding the material per large mask and multiplying it by 2. 

Material per large mask = 2.25 yards / 3 large masks = 0.75 yards per large mask. 
Material for 2 large masks = 0.75 yards per large mask * 2 large masks = 1.5 yards.

Total material for large masks = 4.5 yards + 1.5 yards = 6 yards.

Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. We are given that D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8, and four years ago, Adam's age was A - 4. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2:

30 = A

So Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we first need to find the number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. So, we can calculate the number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * Farmer Brown's farm + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500

Now, we can find the total number of acres of the two farms by adding the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to determine how many packages he completes per hour. It is given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so the number of packages he completes per hour is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, his hourly earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by his pay per package: 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

To find his total earnings in an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works: $8 * 8 = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on the extreme sudoku puzzle and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle of water.

First, we find the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle: 
Time for a normal sudoku puzzle = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * Time for a normal sudoku puzzle
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks:
Number of bottles = Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle / 30 minutes
Number of bottles = 180 minutes / 30 minutes
Number of bottles = 6

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:

2 pieces/red balloon * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 pieces - 40 pieces = 18 pieces

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces / 3 pieces/yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

"To find the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a month and divide it by the miles required for a tune-up.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up:
Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. The difference between these two ages is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount his parents gave him.

Colby saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents gave him $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10. So, the total cost for the night will be $10 + $10 = $20.

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference.

1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute L from equation (2) into equation (3):
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P and L from the above equations into equation (1):
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation (2):
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so the total number of hours in a month is 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's find the distance James swam initially. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile distance, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can find the initial swimming time by dividing the distance by James' swimming speed:

Initial swimming time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

The resting time is half the initial swimming time:

Resting time = Initial swimming time / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, let's find the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum initially = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half his original speed for the remaining distance, his new speed is:

New speed = Original speed / 2 = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can find the final swimming time by dividing the remaining distance by James' new speed:

Final swimming time = Remaining distance / New speed = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to cross the lake by adding the initial swimming time, resting time, and final swimming time:

Total time = Initial swimming time + Resting time + Final swimming time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"Let's denote Bahati's points as B, Azibo's points as A, and Dinar's points as D. We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that B + A + D = 45.

We can express A and D in terms of B: A = B - 20 and D = B - 10. Substituting these expressions into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get:

B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3B - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Divide by 3:
B = 25

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 20
A = 25 - 20
A = 5

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his rate of stapling.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes, which is 2 reports per minute.

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports stapled per minute: 900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes early, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time:
480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is a total of 23 minutes. We need to subtract this time from her total sleep time as well:
475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons he initially had. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:
50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the final number of unoccupied beds:
800 - 700 = 100 beds

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we can find the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried: 
1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, to find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by the three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan's Pokémon: 147"

Number of episodes = 10

Now, we can find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first leg = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction for the second leg = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the third leg = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles

Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = Total distance traveled in the southerly direction - Total distance traveled in the northerly direction
Net distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."

Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. 
Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. 

To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies. 
Brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To calculate her age, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, so she gave away a total of:

2 boxes * 2 people = 4 boxes
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is:

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. To find the number of cherries Jerry has, we subtract the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10 + 15 = 25.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of boxes sold by their respective costs:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is:

12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant to find out how many plants Pat needs:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 45 plants.

Total soil used by sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used by sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type and add them up.

1. Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
2. Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
3. Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we first need to find the number of flights the second plane makes and then double it. The second plane makes 44 trips, so the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22, which are split equally between France and Germany.

The number of flights to France is half of the remaining flights, which is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W' and the age of Helene as 'H'. We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, we can write the equation:

H = 2 * (Total age / 4)
H = 2 * (20 / 4)
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the first equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match. 

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to find the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the number of people in the church next door, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given is 1500 * 1/2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given by 15 to find the number of people in the church: 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices is 4x (for kids) + 2(2x) (for adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total number of slices represents the whole watermelon, we can set up a proportion to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:

Adult's slice / Total slices = Percentage of watermelon
2x / 8x = Percentage of watermelon

To find the percentage, we can divide 2x by 8x and multiply by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the total time spent on rounds and appointments, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract it from the serving time.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost per student, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost for 12 sessions in a month is $40 * 12 = $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, not the cost. Since the question does not provide information about the revenue generated per session, we will assume the cost is the amount the dance studio earns from the students (i.e., the students pay $40 per session in total).

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box.

The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Total number of babies born in a year = 48 * 30 
= 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year.

Total number of porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 
= 1490

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = Length × Width × Height

Given the dimensions of the pool:
Length (L) = 25 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet
Height (H) = 4 feet

Volume = L × W × H
Volume = 25 × 14 × 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed:
Gallons = Volume × 5.9
Gallons = 1400 × 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool at $0.10 per gallon:
Cost = Gallons × $0.10
Cost = 8260 × $0.10
Cost = $826

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
9 (red sticks) + 14 (blue sticks) + 11 (yellow sticks) = 34

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons
Total water pumped: 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, and 12000 gallons have been pumped. To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity:
18000 - 12000 = 6000

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end was 28%, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Charge after 3 hours = Charge before 3 hours * (1 - 0.07)^3
0.28 = Charge before 3 hours * (0.93)^3

Now, we can solve for the charge before 3 hours:
Charge before 3 hours = 0.28 / (0.93)^3
Charge before 3 hours ≈ 0.28 / 0.794
Charge before 3 hours ≈ 0.3527

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up another equation:

Charge before 3 hours = Initial charge * (1 - 0.09)^5
0.3527 ≈ Initial charge * (0.91)^5

Now, we can solve for the initial charge:
Initial charge ≈ 0.3527 / (0.91)^5
Initial charge ≈ 0.3527 / 0.624
Initial charge ≈ 0.565

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 56.5%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10,000. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income, which is the sum of her wages and tips.
Total hourly income = $10/hour (wages) + $15/hour (tips) = $25/hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her total weekly income is:
Total weekly income = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
Number of weeks = Total amount needed / Total weekly income
= $2,000 / $1,000/week

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa's total earnings from the sales of large and small stuffed animals is $120. This can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:

Now, she had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her 28 balloons, for a total of 28 + 6 = 34 balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the seats allocated for graduates, which is 950.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3. 

Number of small beans = 3 * 150 = 450

"To find Melissa's total pay, we first need to calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings = $15 per day * 3 days = $45
Total expenses = $3 per day * 3 days = $9

Now, we can find her net pay by subtracting her total expenses from her total earnings:
Net pay = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net pay = $45 - $9
Net pay = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours spent is:
Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Now, we can find her pay per hour after expenses by dividing her net pay by her total hours:
Pay per hour = Net pay / Total hours
Pay per hour = $36 / 18
Pay per hour = $2

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to determine the number of bottles he will place. 

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each bottle:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

Total number of apples = 40 * 2
Total number of apples = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed and the total amount of money he lost by not working while in school.

The total amount of money Jim borrowed is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

The total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is his previous income of $25,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and make up for the lost income is:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year ($25,000 * 3). To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
Area = length * width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
Total area = 2 * 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8:
21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:
189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set (x = 6), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then determine the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

The total number of guests invited is 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee covers 20 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount they spent and subtract it from their initial amount.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * $60 = $15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:
Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.
Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

The total amount of money they have left is $45 + $40 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. It will leave the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected so far is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect. This is 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week. This is 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then find the percentage:
Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is the total distance divided by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then find the difference.

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Rate = Total growth / Number of years
Rate = 8 inches / 4 years

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

First, let's calculate the time spent in class per day:
6 periods (normal classes) + 2 extra classes = 8 classes per day
Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is:
8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes/day

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is:
320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends:
John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each Saturday and Sunday. 
First, we need to convert the total weekly minutes to hours:
1600 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 26.67 hours/week

Now, we can calculate the extra learning time on each weekend day:
1/16 * 1600 minutes/week = 100 minutes/weekend day
Since there are 2 weekend days, the total extra learning time is:
100 minutes/weekend day * 2 weekend days = 200 minutes/week
Converting this to hours:
200 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 3.33 hours/week

Now, we can add the time spent in class and the extra learning time to find the total time spent learning per week:
26.67 hours/week (class time) + 3.33 hours/week (extra learning time) = 30 hours/week

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the first bounce and then apply the same ratio to find the height of the second bounce.

The initial height from which Nathan drops the ball is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will reach 2/3rds of the height it reached on the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To find the total earnings of the orchard, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5).

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother) and 6 are unshaken.

The probability of selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days he works.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people Billy helps is 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide

Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning the item that cost $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her desired annual retirement income is:

$100,000 x 0.40 = $40,000 per year

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, her total retirement savings goal is:

$40,000 per year x 20 years = $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves per year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, her annual savings are:

$100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To determine how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide her total retirement savings goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, not the number of additional years she needs to work. Since the problem doesn't specify how many years Lauren has already worked, we'll assume she's just starting to save. Therefore, the number of years Lauren needs to work is the same as the total number of years calculated above.

The total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.
The total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of ball: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will give to Peter and Paul.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * (1/4) = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg.

The total amount given to Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, and they gave 7 kg to Peter and Paul, they will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

However, the question asks about James, but there is no James mentioned in the initial statement. It seems there might be a mistake in the question, and it should be asking about Pierre, Paul, and Jacques instead. Assuming that's the case, the answer would be:

"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to calculate the net change in temperature from the initial temperature.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop overnight = -8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase in the morning = 3 degrees Celsius

Net change in temperature = -8 + 3 = -5 degrees Celsius

Now, we add the net change to the initial temperature to find the temperature in the morning:
Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature + Net change
= 2 + (-5)
= -3 degrees Celsius

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he had initially and the money he saved, then subtract the total amount he spent.

Raymond initially had $21 and saved $11 from his allowance, so the total amount of money he had is:
$21 (initial amount) + $11 (saved) = $32

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is:
$5 (comic book) + $19 (puzzle) = $24

Now, we subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he had:
$32 (total amount) - $24 (total spent) = $8

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the two books. We know that Anna had a budget of $16 and she has already spent $4 before buying the two books. So, the remaining budget before buying the two books is $16 - $4 = $12.

After buying the two books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. This means that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the two books by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total cost of the two books / 2
Cost of each book = $10 / 2
Cost of each book = $5

"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students enrolled last year and add it to the original number.

Number of students last year = 50
Increase in enrollment = 20% of 50

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes:
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times:
Time = Number of blinks / Rate per minute
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 male fishes. Tate bought 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, so the new total number of male fishes is 7 + 2 + 2 = 11.

Initially, there were 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 7 + 5 = 12 female fishes. Tate bought 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so the new total number of female fishes is 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18.

"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we find the distance of the one-way trip. Since distance = speed * time, and the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, the distance is:
distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since this is a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
round trip distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
total miles per month = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, we can set up an equation where Sofie's total distance is twice Brian's total distance.

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance
70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

"To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional production after the 10-hour shift must produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's two dogs and add it to the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 * (1/4) = 60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 * (1/2) = 60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total weight of large bags = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
Total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 10 M&M's in each bag.

Number of small bags = Total number of M&M's / Number of M&M's per small bag

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first determine his age two years ago. 

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together the four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the total number of logs is:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John can make 5 planks, so the total number of planks is:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the selling price of each plank:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 's' miles per minute. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2s miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / s
We are given that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so:
40 = 2 / s
s = 2 / 40 = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2s)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 / (2 * 1/20)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 / (1/10)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This is $60 - $32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save ($28) by her weekly savings ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take: $28 / $4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the final temperature of the water in the bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into his bottle, the total volume becomes 5 ounces. 

The final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. We can use the concept of weighted averages to set up an equation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees

Multiply both sides by 5 ounces to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x = 5 * 40
132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number brought in three weeks:
Cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (brought in) = 470
Chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (brought in) = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:

84 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold by adding the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to find the total number of eggs. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, and one dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to get the total number of eggs.

Total number of eggs = 3 * 12 = 36

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children, which is 4.

Number of eggs per child = Total number of eggs / Number of children
= 36 / 4
= 9

"To find out how much Jen spends on food in the month of May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for the fish.

May has 31 days. Since Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the daily cost of food is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find the number of roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number and then add the roses she bought.

Initial roses: 30
Roses given away: 24
Roses left: 30 - 24 = 6
Roses bought: 15
Total roses now: 6 + 15 = 21

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to find the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then multiply them together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6, or 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning to find the probability that both tickets are winners:
0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first determine the total number of seashells collected. 

Let's start with Jim, who collected 27 seashells. Since Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, we can find Carlos' total by subtracting 5 from Jim's total: 
27 - 5 = 22

Now, we know Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can find Carrey's total by dividing Carlos' total by 2:
22 / 2 = 11

Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding their totals:
27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can find the number of seashells each person got by dividing the total by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and Mason eats 4 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we can calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

"To find the profit Linus earned, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost price of one device is $20. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices bought is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120.

The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit earned is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs. 

Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we can calculate the number of bottles required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs as follows:

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, we can calculate the number of bottles required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the additional number of bottles they need to produce to meet the required amount:

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is:
8 * (3/4) = 6

The number of babies wearing blue is:
8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows:
6 * (1/3) = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $50.

2. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land. Abraham initially had 80 square meters. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

   He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. The amount earned from this sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add the amounts earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times per outing and goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks used per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Since we want to find the number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."

So, Ronnie's money left is 5 - x, and Rissa's money left is 15 - x.

It is given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

Solving for x, we get:
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now, we know Ronnie's money left is 5 - x, which is 5 - 3 = 2.

Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints
Non-yellow paint (red, white, and purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. Since each bill is $20, the amount of money he has left is 20 * $20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money. So, he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill: $1200 / $5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we first need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the amount of chalk used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45.

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Now, we subtract the amount used from the original length to find the amount of chalk left.

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many times 20% of the chalk can be subtracted from the remaining chalk before it's less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate 20% of the remaining chalk.

2.75 * 0.20 = 0.55 inches

Now, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to find the number of days.

2.75 / 0.55 = 5

However, this calculation assumes the teacher can use the chalk until it's exactly 0 inches long. Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it takes to get to 2 inches.

Let's subtract 2 inches from the remaining chalk and divide by the amount used each day.

2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches

Now, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day.

0.75 / 0.55 = 1.36 (round down to 1, since we can't have a fraction of a day)

However, this is the number of days it takes to get from 2.75 inches to 2 inches. We need to add the days it takes to get from 2 inches to the point where the teacher can no longer use the chalk. Since the teacher can use the chalk until it's 2 inches long, we can add 1 more day (the day the chalk becomes too small to use).

So, the teacher has 5 days from Monday, but on the 5th day, the chalk will be too small to use. Therefore, the teacher has 4 full days of usable chalk left after Monday.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we first need to calculate the total amount he paid for the milk and then find the amount he paid for the sour milk.

Total amount paid for the milk = Total gallons of milk * Cost per gallon
Total amount paid for the milk = 4000 * $3.5
Total amount paid for the milk = $14000

Now, we need to find the amount of sour milk and the amount he paid for it.
Amount of sour milk = 2/5 * Total gallons of milk
Amount of sour milk = 2/5 * 4000
Amount of sour milk = 1600 gallons

Amount paid for sour milk = Amount of sour milk * Cost per gallon
Amount paid for sour milk = 1600 * $3.5
Amount paid for sour milk = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin's current age is 20."
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find the number of books he can buy per dollar, we divide 100 by 500.

100 books / 500 dollars = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we multiply the number of books per dollar by the total amount of money Bob has.

0.2 books per dollar * 27000 dollars = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, we need to break down the sequence of events.

Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other back at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.

He then picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket, and threw 1 back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has 5 (in his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11 apples.

Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home. Since he already had 5 apples in his pocket and picked up the 6 that fell, he brought home a total of 5 + 6 = 11 apples.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices required is 10 * 6 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas needed separately.

For cheese pizzas, each pizza has 12 slices. To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, divide the total number of cheese slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 slices. 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizzas, each pizza has 8 slices. To find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, divide the total number of pepperoni slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 slices. 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to a rate of 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate of melting per minute, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt. This is (1/3) - (2/15) snowballs per minute.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. The net rate is then (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute to find the time it will take. This gives us 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and the anniversary marks 20 years since the show came out, we can calculate John's age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age at that time.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, the net gain of bandages on the third day is 100 - 25 = 75.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that before ordering the two bulk packs on the third day, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

So, before the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38. This means that before ordering the bulk pack on the first day, they had 31 + 38 - 50 = 19 bandages.

Since the cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle, we can calculate the cost per bottle of cognac as follows:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so the number of bottles of cognac is:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10

John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, the capacity of each of John's classes is 120 * 1/8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school.

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school
= 120 + 30

"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 borrowed, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount owed is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

To find the amount he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount owed: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan changes the remaining diapers, he changes 10 - 5 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the total volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches each, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 540 / 0.15 = 3600. However, the packing efficiency is 80%, so the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the total number of red jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900, so Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 2 times the number of people in the class, which is 5. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

To find Shelley's paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now, we know Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. We can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8

The total distance is 200 yards, with half on land and half in water. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. 

First, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed (56) by the number of sticks per box (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob can't buy a fraction of a box, he needs to buy 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. 

Now, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box ($2.00) to find the total cost.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is half the cost of the main phone. 

Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2 = $10

There are 4 additional phones. 

Cost of additional phones = 4 * $10 = $40

Total cost of the phone plan = Cost of main phone + Cost of additional phones
Total cost of the phone plan = $20 + $40
Total cost of the phone plan = $60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

First, we need to find the total number of doughnuts made per day. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of doughnuts made per day is:
10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts sold per day is also 120.

The price per doughnut is $2, so the total amount of money Derrick makes per day is:
120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day

Now, we need to find the total number of days in June. June has 30 days, so the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
$240/day * 30 days = $7200

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 450 by 10.

Total words = 450 * 10 = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people for each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies.

We know that there are 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack (1 of each flavor):
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Total cookies after snack = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

Total cookies after lunch = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Total cookies after giving to friends = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Total cookies after baking = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

"To find the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of the collection and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of the collection would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount would be 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, let's consider the rate at which Nate fills in holes and the dog digs new holes. The net change in the number of holes per day is the difference between the number of holes Nate fills in and the number of holes the dog digs.

Net change per day = 9 holes/day (filled by Nate) - 6 holes/day (dug by the dog) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate needs to fill in 84 holes, we can divide the total number of holes by the net change per day to find the number of days it takes him to fill in all the holes.

Number of days = Total holes / Net change per day = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

To convert the number of days to weeks, we divide by 7.

Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which was 14. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes. Let's denote the number of beakers as B. Then, the total number of items can be expressed as:

8 (test tubes) + B (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

8 + 16 + B = 29
24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to isolate B:

B = 29 - 24
B = 5

However, we are asked to find the number of beakers Igor lost, not the number of beakers he gathered. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered 5. Therefore, Igor lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

Distance Vanessa ran = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
4 = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
Distance Aaron ran = 4 / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. We also know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 2 miles in 32 minutes (twice the time it takes Aaron).

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we know it takes her 32 minutes to run 2 miles, we can find the time it takes her to run 4 miles by multiplying the time it takes her to run 2 miles by 2:

Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * Time Vanessa ran 2 miles
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * 32
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 64 minutes

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 * 200 feet
Total line required = 600 feet

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total line required to find out how much more line he needs to buy.

Line to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line to buy = 600 feet - 6 feet
Line to buy = 594 feet

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. 
Profit per watermelon = 25% of cost price per watermelon
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first determine the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. 

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so the current age of John is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, the current age of the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400:
80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is:
$400 - $320 = $80

The cost of the mechanic's labor is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours:
$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor:
$80 + $150 = $230

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 30 / 2
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

The number of chickens is 5."
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.
