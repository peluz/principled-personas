"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. 

First, let's find out how many eggs she uses for herself and her friends. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs her ducks lay. 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg. 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Total bolts required = blue fiber + white fiber = 2 + 1 = 3

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost from it.

The initial value of the house was $80,000. After the repairs, the value increased by 150%. To calculate the new value, we need to find 150% of the initial value and add it to the initial value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost for Josh is $80,000 (initial cost) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 9 = 180 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city. 

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. We can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle
Total = 160 + 80 + 20
Total = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we first need to calculate the amount of data Carla downloads before the restart. Since she downloads 40% of the 200 GB file, we can calculate this as follows:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the total time it takes to download the entire 200 GB file is:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, we need to add the 40 minutes Carla spent downloading before the restart and the 20 minutes spent on the restart itself. Therefore, the total time is:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

Total time: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he initially drove away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance he covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he covered during the 4 hours he tried to get home. 
He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance during that time.
He spent the next half-hour driving at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 0.5 hours (half-hour)
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

He spent the remaining time driving at 80 mph. The remaining time is:
Time = 4 - 2 - 0.5
Time = 1.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance he covered during the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120
Total Distance = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he covered during the 4 hours from the distance he initially drove away from home:
Distance from home = 180 - 135
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month separately.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Subtracting 54 from 180 gives us 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads over the three months by adding the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue exceeds the total cost in the 6th year.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling some at the orange house. Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house (5 * 2 = 10).

Before the orange house, she had sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than at the green house. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house 'x'. Then, she sold x + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.

Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is 3x.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

3x - x - (x + 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

x = 12

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with:

3x = 3 * 12 = 36

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances covered on both days.

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to determine the total time she has available to complete the hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. To complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa will need 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 1 + 1 = 2 hours. This means she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to complete the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23

"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, which means he spent $195 - $5 = $190 on video games and other possible expenses. However, we know he spent $160 on video games, so the remaining $30 must have been spent on other expenses or he had $30 initially.

Since we are only concerned with the Lego sets, we can calculate how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he spent on video games and other expenses ($190) by the price of each Lego set ($15). However, this is not necessary as we already know he sold all his Lego sets to buy video games and had some money left.

Given that he had $5 left and spent $160 on video games, we can conclude that he sold all his Lego sets.

The number of Lego sets he still has is 0."

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, if she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, one-third of the time is 6 / 3 = 2 hours, and two-thirds of the time is 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.

So, in 2 hours of running, Dana can travel 2 * 6 = 12 miles, and in 4 hours of walking, she can travel 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

Therefore, in six hours, Dana can travel a total of 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame range.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the safe distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones initially set out. Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. After using them, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes Candice had after buying the package is the sum of the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased: 80 + x.

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 remaining. So, the equation becomes: 
80 + x - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for 'x':
80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors with 8 units each, the total number of units is:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units
Occupied units = 0.75 * 120 units
Occupied units = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7.

Eggs per day: 252
Eggs per week: 252 * 7 = 1764

Now, let's convert the total number of eggs per week to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Eggs per week: 1764
Dozens per week: 1764 / 12 = 147

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week by multiplying the number of dozens per week by the price per dozen.

Dozens per week: 147
Price per dozen: $2
Total amount per week: 147 * 2 = $294

"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Distance = Speed * Time. 
Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he sailed for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he traveled is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance Tom needs to travel back is 30 miles, and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books will weigh 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, earning 6 * $60 = $360. The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each, earning 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, earning 12 * $40 = $480. The mechanic did not repair any truck tires, so the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40.

Jean initially had 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining number of lollipops by 2. 

28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the charges into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena was charged the initial amount of $140 per month. 
Total amount for the first half of the year = $140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena was charged 10% less than the initial amount. 
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.
So, the reduced amount for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
Total amount for the second half of the year = $126 * 6 = $756.

Total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Now, we need to find their combined weights. 
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to calculate the number of thorns per rose bush and then multiply it by the number of rose bushes.

Each rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns. So, the number of thorns per rose bush is 25 * 8 = 200.

Since Dan plants 3 rose bushes, the total number of thorns is 200 * 3 = 600.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won would be 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations, which is 44.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and then add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times. 
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to determine her monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

Since Sylvie has been with the company for five years, she is eligible for the 10% increase. The 10% increase on her initial monthly salary of $600 is calculated as follows:
10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60

Her new monthly salary after the increase is:
$600 + $60 = $660

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we will calculate the increase for each year:
Year 1: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66, new monthly salary = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 2: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60, new monthly salary = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 3: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86, new monthly salary = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

To calculate her annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:
$878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the number of gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to establish the age relationships between the siblings. 

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

We are given that the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. 

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we find the number of girls in the girl scout:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * Number of girls
= 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. 
2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the canned tomatoes before they were cooked into sauce. Since the sauce lost half its volume, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been double the volume of the sauce. 

The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes was 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the canned tomatoes by the volume of each can. 

Number of cans = Total volume of canned tomatoes / Volume of each can
Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces
Number of cans = 4

Now, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes in each can.

Total number of tomatoes = Number of cans * Number of tomatoes per can
Total number of tomatoes = 4 * 3
Total number of tomatoes = 12

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract 20 from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam: 25 - 20 = 5.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she initially has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants. 

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, the remaining number of pages he needs to read is:
39 - 15 = 24 pages.

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining number of pages by the number of days:

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) and has a soda with dinner. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are there in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 sections

Since the fog bank covers 1 section in 10 minutes, it will cover 14 sections in 14 * 10 minutes.

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Original dimensions: 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches
Inner dimensions: (5 - 2) inches by (6 - 2) inches by (4 - 2) inches
Inner dimensions: 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = length * width * height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24 cubic inches
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes). Then, we divide the total minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes (90 / 30 = 3).

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies, so before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, Henry actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation to find the number of cookies he baked last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90.

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then find out how much water the boat took on for that distance.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we need to know how many 20-foot intervals she rowed in 64 seconds. 

Since 64 seconds is 4 times 16 seconds, Julia rowed 4 times the distance she rowed in 16 seconds. So, the total distance she rowed is 4 * 20 feet = 80 feet.

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we need to divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. 
Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

Original cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16/board = $80
Total original cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price will be 150% of the original price.

New price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 * 1.5 = $15/board
New price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 * 1.5 = $24/board

Selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
Selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24/board = $120

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, 2 containers with 5 vehicles each were imported. So, the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's initial salary, then calculate Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

Adrien's initial salary was $40000. Since Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = 40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = 30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Adrien's initial salary was $40000. Four years later, his salary had increased by 40%, so we can calculate his new salary:

Adrien's new salary = Adrien's initial salary + 40% of Adrien's initial salary
Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 0.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 16000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume the same percentage increase for Lylah. However, the problem does not specify the percentage increase for Lylah. We can only assume that Adrien's salary increased by 40% more than what he was making four years ago. To find Lylah's new salary, we will assume the same percentage increase as Adrien's initial increase over Lylah's salary (30%) does not apply here. However, we can calculate Lylah's new salary if we assume the same percentage increase as Adrien's (40% increase). 

Lylah's new salary = Lylah's initial salary + 40% of Lylah's initial salary
Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 0.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 12307
Lylah's new salary = 43076

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43076
Total salary = 99076

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped (20) from the current total (30). 

30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had initially, we need to add the 3 spoons she used back to the 7 spoons.

7 spoons + 3 spoons = 10 spoons

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages he bought and add it to the number of chicken sausages.

Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages (38) to the number of fish sausages (44) to find the total number of sausages.

Total sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding the number of friends each of them made:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he is buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

We also know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day. The total time spent by the doctors is:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent by the doctors in hours is:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, and the total time spent by the doctors is 200 hours. However, this time is spread across 500 patients, so the average time spent per patient is 24 minutes or 0.4 hours. The total revenue generated from the patients is:
500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

"To find the number of elves left, we need to calculate the number of elves who quit and subtract that from the total number of elves initially hired.

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there were 60 elves initially, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

After 20 elves quit, the remaining number of elves is 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, the number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost of the items and delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations we derived earlier, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees. Since W = 4Q, W = 4(100) = 400.

- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the overall cost:
Total cost: $5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months. 

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

After the first 2 months, the price will be $20 + $4 = $24.

However, for the next 2-month interval, the price increase will be 20% of the new price ($24), not the original price. 
20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80

The price after the second 2-month interval will be $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We can see a pattern emerging, where the price increase is 20% of the previous price. This is a classic example of compound interest.

To calculate the price after 18 intervals, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

where A is the final price, P is the original price, r is the interest rate (20% in this case), and n is the number of intervals.

A = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20 * 7.485947397

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider both his weekday and weekend walking habits.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, he walks 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 days in a weekend. So, he walks 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. 
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we first need to find out how much she pays each month. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. The total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of $1000. 50% of $1000 is 0.5 * $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the minimum payment. $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 to get the yearly payment. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

Total time to prep a potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, multiply the total time to prep a potato by the total number of potatoes:

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to determine how many gallons of lemonade they made. 

Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find the number of gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon to find the total amount spent on lemons: 5 * $3 = $15.

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.

Total expenses so far: $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and it is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is:

4 * 40 = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The less well-rounded team has the following times for each member:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:

"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to establish the probability of this event. A six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 50%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. 

Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 25%.

Now, let's calculate the difference in percentage between the two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters from the total straw given to the rats and hamsters to find the straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score of 71 from the total. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86.

The total score for these four tests is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To achieve an average of 93, the total score for the five tests (after removing the lowest score) should be 5 * 93 = 465.

However, since we are removing the lowest score, we need to consider the total score for the six tests. Let's call the score on the sixth test 'x'. The total score for the six tests should be 6 * 93 = 558.

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests (including the lowest score) from the total score for the six tests. The total score of the first five tests is 367 + 71 = 438.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates is 6. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the amount of water in the small pool is 'x - 16', and the amount of water in the big pool is '2x - 16'. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x', we can find the amount of water in the small pool now. The small pool had 'x' gallons of water 4 minutes ago, and it lost 16 gallons since then. So, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes.

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

- 40 water-type cards

After losing 8 water-type cards:
- 30 fire-type cards
- 20 grass-type cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards

After buying 14 grass-type cards:
- 30 fire-type cards
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards
- 32 water-type cards

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

"To find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to break down the problem into steps.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the cars. 10% of $240,000 is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Finally, we add the registration cost for 12 cars at $1000 each: 12 * $1000 = $12,000. Adding this to the previous total, we get $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of pens Ram buys and the number of new pens he can create by mixing the ink from empty pens.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. 

After using the initial 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens. He can mix the ink from these 25 empty pens to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, Ram has 5 new pens and 5 empty pens (from the newly created pens). He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Now, Ram has 1 new pen and 1 empty pen (from the newly created pen). He can mix the ink from this 1 empty pen with 4 more empty pens from the previous set of empty pens to make 1 / 5 + 4 / 5 = 1 new pen (but he only has 4 empty pens left from the previous set, so he can't make another pen).

However, he can't make any more new pens because he doesn't have enough empty pens to mix the ink. 

So, Ram initially had 25 pens, then he made 5 new pens, then 1 new pen, and then 1 more new pen.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

However, Mike only writes half of these pages, so he writes 60 / 2 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing per week.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to determine the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We are given that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. 

With 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 60 * 0.5 = 30, and the total number of girls is also 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of animals he killed last night and today, then add them together.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's call the number of cougars he killed today 'x'. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also told that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now we know that x = 12. So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

Today, Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to determine the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the cows. So, the initial 10 stalls with 20 cows each now have a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 (initial) + 2 (new) = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section. 

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to get the current weight. 

To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract 2400 pounds from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have: 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To determine the amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making. Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12.

Today, Carla is making 36 cookies. 36 / 12 = 3. So, Carla is making 3 dozen cookies today.

Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. 30 / 12 = 2.5. So, Carla is making 2.5 dozen cookies tomorrow.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed.

Today, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.
Tomorrow, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

To find the total amount of flour Carla will need, we can add the amount needed today and tomorrow.

"To find the total time, we need to break down the process into three stages: heating the oil to 300 degrees, heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 40% longer than 20 minutes. 
   To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which is 8 minutes. 
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees: 20 + 28 = 48 minutes

3. Cooking the chicken: 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. 
   Since it took 48 minutes to warm up the oil, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken: 48 (heating the oil) + 43 (cooking the chicken) = 91 minutes

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to calculate the stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves. 

Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Total stitches for the sleeves = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the stitches for each sleeve.

Stitches for each sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to determine the points each player has after the third round. 

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points (no change).
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (by the oldest) + 4 (by the youngest) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed by his sons. 

15 (total oranges) - 12 (oranges washed) = 3 oranges left unwashed.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises he did each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total for the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total for the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total number of activities for both days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the total weight of the bag by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates."
"To determine the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total number of bids and the amount each bid increases.

The opening bid is $200. Three other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. So, the sequence of bids is as follows:

1. Opening bid: $200
2. Person 1 bids: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Person 2 bids: $300 + $50 = $350
5. Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400
6. Person 3 bids: $400 + $50 = $450
7. Carmen bids (winning bid): $450 + $50 = $500

The final cost of the desk is $500."
"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John's work is 30 miles away, and he goes there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week, so the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The mileage cost is $2 per mile, so the total mileage cost per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost of driving for John per year is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To find the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to calculate the combined time he exercised on Sunday and Monday, then multiply it by 2.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
Combined time on Sunday and Monday: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2:
39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding pattern. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, it creates four pages: two on the front (left and right) and two on the back (left and right). This pattern repeats with each additional fold.

Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of folds, and thus the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 4 pages per fold = 8 folds

However, each fold requires one piece of paper. Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is equal to the number of folds.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 for rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings in April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in April. Assuming a 4-week month (which is a reasonable assumption for April), Watson works 5 days a week, 10 hours a day. 

Total hours worked per week = 5 days * 10 hours/day = 50 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage:
Hourly wage = $10/hour
Total earnings from hourly wage = 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. 
Total bonus in April = $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's calculate his total earnings in April:
Total earnings in April = Total earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus in April
Total earnings in April = $2000 + $1200
Total earnings in April = $3200

First, we find the number of people he beat, which is 80% of 20. 
80% of 20 is 0.8 * 20 = 16.

Since John beat 16 people, he must have lost to the remaining people. 
The number of people he lost to is 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.
3. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves of bread for the rest of the day.
4. Half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.
5. Since the remaining 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. 
8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week (since 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week).

8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings from one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract them from his initial budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, we calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we add up the total expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo's initial budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. So, the amount he has available to spend is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, we subtract his total expenses from the amount he has available to spend: $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The total daily egg consumption for the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago would have been 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile would be 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

Width (W) = 4 feet
Depth (D) = 5 feet

Volume = L * W * D
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and it has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to determine how many pencils each box can hold. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and a total of 26 pencils, we can subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total to find out how many pencils are in the boxes. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, we know that each box can hold 8 pencils. Jam and Meg have a total of 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we can divide the total pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we need to consider that not all employees are programmers. The problem doesn't specify the total number of programmers, but we can assume that the remaining employees are either senior programmers or non-programmers. For the sake of calculation, let's assume the remaining employees are either senior programmers or non-programmers, and we will only consider the programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers
However, we cannot accurately determine the number of senior programmers with the given information. Let's assume the remaining employees are a mix of senior programmers and non-programmers.

Number of employees who are not junior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of employees who are not junior programmers = 60

Now, let's assume all 60 are senior programmers for the sake of calculation.

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
Salary of senior programmers = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000
Total amount paid to junior programmers = $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400
Total amount paid to senior programmers = $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers

"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we first need to find out how much more charge is required to reach 100%. 

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40% as follows:

Time required = (40 percentage-points) * (3 minutes/percentage-point) 
Time required = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

Time required = 120 minutes / 60

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we first need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip. 

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, we divide $80 by $20 to find the number of rewards earned. $80 / $20 = 4. So, the customer earned 4 rewards of $1 each, totaling $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, reducing the price to $43 - $4 = $39. 

Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

- Income tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

Difference in net income: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, since there seems to be a discrepancy in the names (RJ and Richard), we will assume that RJ is actually Richard and the correct number of guns Richard has is 1, not 5. If we consider Richard having 5 guns, then we would have two people with the same name, which is not possible in this context.

So, the total number of guns is 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (Richard) + 5 (this will be ignored as it's a duplicate name) = 19 guns.

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people: 19 / 4 = 4.75.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the total initial value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. This means the new price is 150% of the initial price, or 1.5 * $8 = $12 per share. The total value after the first year is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price is 75% of the price after the first year, or 0.75 * $12 = $9 per share. The total value after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

"To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, let's find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group can be represented as 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"To find the total number of legs, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. The number of chickens would then be '2x'. 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 2x = 60
Combine like terms:
3x = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the following:
- The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they each weigh 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals:
240 pounds (animals) + 20 pounds (container) = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he ran after taking his coach's advice. 

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, we calculate the additional distance as 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies per week.

"To find the total cost of the shirts before the discount, we need to multiply the cost of one shirt by the number of shirts. 

The cost of one shirt is $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts. 
Total cost before discount = 2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Since Davos got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of the total cost before the discount and subtract it from the total cost.

40% of $60 = 0.4 * $60 = $24

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount.
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we first need to calculate the daily earnings when the factory made tractors and when it made silos.

When the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor. So, their daily earnings were:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So, their daily earnings are:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and divide it by the original daily earnings, then multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = ((New earnings - Old earnings) / Old earnings) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to determine the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours. This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation.

To find the total time he spent on vacation, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Since Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he received must be $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we know that Billy started with $10 and received $4 in change. This means he spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy.

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, which is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. 

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we multiply 3 by 4 and subtract 5 to get the number of shoplifters:
3 * 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, we are told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we multiply 7 by 3 to get the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:
7 * 3 = 21

Now, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, and 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence. To find the total number of customers kicked out for these reasons, we add these numbers together:

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the total cost of the frames is:
44 * $20 = $880

Since each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, we need to calculate the etching cost:
20% of $880 = 0.20 * $880 = $176

So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is:
$880 + $176 = $1056

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is:
2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is:
44 / 4 = 11

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:
11 * $12 = $132

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts:
$1056 (picture frames with etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and subtract it from the market price.

Market price = $400
Discount = 20% of $400
Discount = 0.20 * $400
Discount = $80

Total cost of DIY hand-painted wallpaper = Market price - Discount
Total cost of DIY hand-painted wallpaper = $400 - $80
Total cost of DIY hand-painted wallpaper = $320

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the sales for each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

- Tuesdays: 1 hour
- Thursdays: 2 hours
- Saturdays: Since Saturday's practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, it was 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 hour (Tuesdays) + 2 hours (Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment was faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

A dozen is equal to 12. Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls and gave one to each of her 6 children. So, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 
6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first determine the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to determine the number of apples she picked on Monday. 

Since Lucy sold the apples at $4 per piece and she got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she earned ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount earned on Monday / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day (Tuesday), which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days by adding the number of apples she picked each day.

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Initially, there were 50 socks that needed washing. To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks: 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she initially had and then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

Rachel initially had 23 cookies that she bought. Janet gave her 42 cookies, so the total number of cookies Rachel had was 23 + 42 = 65.

Her brother ate 44 cookies, so the number of cookies left for Rachel is 65 - 44 = 21.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.1
Time (T) = 5 months or 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount ≈ $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos for both Axel and Anna:

Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos
Total silver pesos = 50 + 100
Total silver pesos = 150

Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos
Total gold pesos = 80 + 120
Total gold pesos = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos
Total number of pesos = 150 + 200
Total number of pesos = 350

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make with 3 pitchers: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his original land, which is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, so she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for Dasha is 18 * $2 = $36.

Now, let's compare the costs: David spends $30, while Dasha spends $36. 

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we multiply the value of one part (15) by the respective parts of the ratio to find the number of popsicles each has. 
Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount. 

The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so the total cost is $20. 
A 20% discount on $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services:
Netflix: $10
Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
Total cost: $10 + $16 = $26

The cost of the cable package is $60. 
To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spent 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30.

Total cards Erica had initially = 20 (cards she made) + 30 (pre-made cards) = 50

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so the total cards she passed out is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so add these to the cards she has left: 21 + 17 = 38

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the number of slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices, and finally subtract the slices Jenny ate.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

Jenny gave a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark.

Now, subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 = 5.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so subtract those from the remaining slices: 5 - 2 = 3.

"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save money to buy the bike, we first need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save. 

Mark currently has $50 in his bank account, and the bike costs $300. Therefore, the amount he still needs to save is $300 - $50 = $250.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save by dividing the amount he still needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10).

Number of days = $250 / $10 = 25

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs separately.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders.

Next, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3rd the number of spiders. 
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30.

Now, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48.

Finally, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Given that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

Now, to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a month by 12:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and then at the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours, 
7200 watt-hours/day = 7.2 kWh/day
In 30 days, the total energy used at the original usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day (8 hours - 5 hours) = 2700 watt-hours/day
2700 watt-hours/day = 2.7 kWh/day
In 30 days, the total energy used at the reduced usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Now, to find the energy saved, we subtract the reduced usage from the original usage:
Energy saved = 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
One zebra has 36 stripes. 
Another zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost per pound.

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to get the total cost.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the additional items he purchased.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we add the initial and purchased quantities of corns and cannolis. The total number of corns is 80 + 60 = 140, and the total number of cannolis is 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 + 100 = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he took before the jog. 

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps, and he has 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, before the jog, he took 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps before the jog, excluding the jog, is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog (excluding the jog) from the total steps taken before the jog. 
8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

First, we need to find the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find the time it takes Toby to read the book. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes him to read the book is:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the time he has available to read the book is:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading the book with:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes to spare

However, Toby still needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport. So, he will be:
20 minutes - 10 minutes = 10 minutes early is incorrect, he will be 20 minutes early before he leaves his house, but after he leaves his house he will be 10 minutes early at the airport.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the number of candles that will explode is 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 
So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 5% of the candles that explode, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. 

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both sisters is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is the number gathered by Joanne.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the first equation as:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the second equation as:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
Size of Zack's locker = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Size of Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we need to subtract the introductory period and the increased rate period from the total months to find the number of months at the normal rate. 
However, since the introductory period is 6 months and the increased rate period is 10 months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the normal rate period is indeed 8 months. 
The cost is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, so the cost is:

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. The total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

Since Dora has $18 and the total cost is $19, she needs $19 - $18 = $1 more.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew in sequence.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

1 gallon = 8 pints
15 gallons = 15 * 8 = 120 pints
120 pints / 5 containers = 24 pints per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we multiply the amount in one container by 1/4.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money George spent on chips and then find out how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = $1.20

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Since he spent $1.20 on chips, the amount he spent on candy bars is:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought with $3.75. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars is:
$3.75 / 0.75 = 5

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we divide the total number of shared lollipops by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, and the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can calculate the weight of one piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of one piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, the total weight of the cake they ate is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake:
Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Weight of cake eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to reach the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width of the room. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)) to find the perimeter.

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We already know James' time for the swim and bike ride. To find James' time for the run, we subtract the sum of his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
James' run time = 180 - 121
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we first need to find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can fill is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and subtract the cost of purchasing them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from this sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers sold to the department store are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers. Since they were sold for $25 each, the revenue from this sale is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of purchasing the sneakers: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each, then add them together.

Six packets had 8 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the additional cost for the popcorn and soda is $1, making the total cost $21.

Now, let's consider the non-super ticket option. The movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the non-super ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

We know that the total cost of the non-super ticket option is $19, and the cost of the movie ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15. To find the regular price of popcorn, we subtract the cost of the movie ticket and soda from the total cost: $19 - $15 = $4.

Regular price of popcorn: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of each raised bed and then the total volume of all the beds. 

The volume of each raised bed is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and height: 
Volume = width * length * height
Volume = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of all the beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs to buy. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the potting soil by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of green cards is 24.

The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the capacity of the farm truck:
Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the farm truck
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10).

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. Since he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, 15 pairs on Wednesday, and 30 pairs on Friday, we need to convert the pairs into individual shoes. 

1 pair = 2 shoes
5 pairs = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
15 pairs = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
30 pairs = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

Now, we add the shoes he received to his initial total:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x': x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

The remoras are 6 inches long each, and there are 2 of them, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to determine the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total number of students.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

1/4 * Total students = 20

To find the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total students = 20 * 4
Total students = 80

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Since Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available is 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days.

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (12) to find out how long he has to spend walking each day:

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15). 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we first need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6), then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both (3) to avoid double-counting. 

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class (32) to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, then add them together.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. 
So, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has three times as many, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn, we need to first calculate the total amount they have earned so far. 

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. The total amount they have earned is $83 + $91 = $174.

Since their goal is to raise $200, we subtract the total amount they have earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn. 

$200 - $174 = $26

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and his player can store up to 100 songs. So, the number of songs Gabriel can add is 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. The number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine the number of oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24 oranges

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is:

Total amount of money = Number of oranges Stetson ate * $10
= 24 * $10
= $240

"To find the total hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume per day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of each bag (50 pounds): 200 / 50 = 4.

First, we find the total number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we multiply the total number of puppies by 2/3.

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = 2/3 * 27 = 18

Next, we find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by 1/3.

Girl Pomeranians = 1/3 * 18 = 6

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the combined height of the cheerleaders in each level and add them together. 

The bottom level consists of 4 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The middle level consists of 3 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall.
3 * 64"" = 192""

The top level consists of 2 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall.
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add the heights of all the levels together:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine her age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in four years = 42

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from her age in four years:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

However, this is not the correct answer because the question asks for Angela's current age, and the calculation above assumes Angela's age in four years. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 18, and Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now (14), which is 42. But in four years, Angela will be 42, so we need to subtract 4 from 42 to get Angela's age in four years from now, and then subtract 4 from that result to get Angela's current age. However, the correct way to calculate Angela's current age is to subtract 4 from 42.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Paul drove his car twice a day for 14 days. So, the total number of morning rides is 14, and the total number of afternoon rides is also 14.

The cost of each morning ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.

The cost of each afternoon ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

Now, we add the total cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Number of guests: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation L + B/2 + B = 43, we get (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine the B terms: 2B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine the B terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. This means he gets 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6. This means he gets 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option in terms of sticks per dollar. However, the question asks for the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

If Frederick buys the 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can buy 24 / 4 = 6 pieces of wood. Since each piece of wood gives 200 sticks, he can make 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of bus trips per day is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. 

Since she takes bus trips five days a week, the total cost of bus trips per week is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. 

The amount Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass is $22 - $20 = $2.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Number of laps: 8
Total distance = Distance per lap * Number of laps
Total distance = 0.25 km * 8
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out the total amount of water she needs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total distance: 2 km
Water needed per km: 60 ml
Total water needed = Total distance * Water needed per km
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml
Total water needed = 120 ml

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total number of vlogs she needs to make.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can assume that the vlogs she made were for the first three weeks of the month.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the total number of vlogs she needs to make:
72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much you paid, we need to calculate the total amount you owe, including the 20% tip. 

First, we'll find the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 
20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, we'll add the tip to the dinner bill to get the total amount before splitting the check.
$50 (dinner bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Since you and your wife are splitting the check evenly, you'll pay half of the total amount.
$60 / 2 = $30

So, you ended up paying $30."
"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He later spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he tripled the $13, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to find out his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first half.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. The daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

The total savings for the month is $1125. We can set up an equation to represent the total savings:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since 'x' represents the daily savings in the first half, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. In the second half, he needs to save twice as much, which is 2x = 2 * 25 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first need to calculate the total amount each of them will receive for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the round trip distance for one day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

The distance to work is 3 miles, so the round trip distance for one day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles * 5 = 30 miles.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process. 

The alphabet consists of 26 letters. 

1. She writes it in full twice: 26 * 2 = 52 letters
2. She writes half of it once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
   Total letters written so far: 52 + 13 = 65 letters
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: 65 * 2 = 130 letters

However, this calculation includes the original 65 letters. We need to subtract the original 65 letters to avoid double-counting.

Total letters written: 130 - 65 = 65 + 65 = 130 

The correct calculation is simply 65 * 2 = 130.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can add the weight he lost to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we first need to determine the total number of toys required for his play set to be five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. Five times that number is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

However, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this number. So, if we let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first calculate the total cost without the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30 and subtract it from the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost with the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from $50.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two categories: sales up to $1000 and sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission. 
30% of $1000 is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission. 
10% of $1500 is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total amount of money Antonella earned, we add the commission from both categories: 
$300 + $150 = $450.

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 * 24 = 48.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the question. The question seems to be asking for a comparison between warm and cold water, as there is no information about hot water.

Assuming the question is asking for a comparison between warm and cold water, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles would take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles would take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, so its cost is 3 * $40 = $120.

The total cost of lunch is the sum of the costs of the two subs: $40 + $120 = $160.

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to determine the weights of Susan and Bob. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds). 

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3: 
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180.

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, it is also at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground initially.

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the sun is moving upward, we add the movement to the initial angle. The new angle from the ground to the sun is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

Since the candles come in packs of 5, James will need to buy 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so James will spend 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. 

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1.5 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 1 = 70 pages per

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as x. We can set up the equation: 51 = 3x.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since x represents the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from x: 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and then add them together.

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, Sharon received 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, in addition to Richie's 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate Mark's goals as follows:
Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate Anna's goals as follows:
Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers by adding their individual scores:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's total earnings. Since Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade.

Mitchell's total earnings = 21 lemonades * $4 per lemonade = $84

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference.

Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many he bought each day and then add them up.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide $70 by 7 to find out how much he can spend each day:

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since he spent $10 per day, he bought 2 wooden action figures each day for 4 days:

2 action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he still has $10 per day to spend, he can buy:

$10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day

For 3 days (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy:

5 action figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Now, we can add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month to find out how many roses he lacks:
260 roses/month (ordered) - 160 roses/month (grown) = 100 roses/month

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

On day three, he saw 0 birds. 
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. 
On day six, he saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

The starting value is 20. 
Half of the number is 20 / 2 = 10. 
The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30. 
This value is then divided by 5, resulting in 30 / 5 = 6. 
The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. 
So, the final value is 6 * 8 = 48.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450°F
Actual temperature: 468°F
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18°F

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520°F, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature is 520°F, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520
x + (0.04x) = 520
1.04x = 520

Now, divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500°F.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time for both movies to find the total time:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils. The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups. The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes.

Since the question asks for the total number of utensils, we assume that the utensils refer to both cups and dishes. Therefore, the total number of utensils is 52 (cups) + 68 (dishes) = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the 10% discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of 1 box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) 
= $100.00 - $10.00 
= $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 * $90.00 
= $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and will last Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 
= 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts 
= $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned during her workout.

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and multiplying by 100.

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to determine how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:

Now, we can calculate the grams of protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the grams of protein per day by 7:

So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Since 90 degrees is the largest angle, that is our answer.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them together.

Initially, Steve received 5 games with his console.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. The total number of games Steve has after the first year is 5 (initial games) + 17 (games bought and received in the first year) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. The total number of games Steve has after the second year is 22 (games he already had) + 29 (games bought and received in the second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. The total number of games Steve has after the third year is 51 (games he already had) + 53 (games bought and received in the third year) = 104 games.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we first need to determine how much each of them makes in an hour.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we know Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
(60 + 90) * 12 = 150 * 12 = 1800

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours separately, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were 15 * $0.50 = $7.50. Since he worked for four hours, his total earnings for the first four hours were 4 * $7.50 = $30.

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were 10 * $0.60 = $6. Since he worked for two hours, his total earnings for the next two hours were 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours to find the total amount of money Patrick earned: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we first need to calculate the total number of rotations per month and then the total number of rotations per year.

The car's tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. To find the number of rotations per mile, we divide 725 by 2, which equals 362.5 rotations per mile.

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month: 362.5 * 400 = 145,000 rotations per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year: 145,000 * 12 = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, divide the total rotations by the rotations per year: 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6 years.

Now, we need to find the cost of each pump. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount: 
30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
$60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional amount. 

Now, we subtract the discounted price from Joe's initial amount of money to find out how much he will have left:
$50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 

The cost per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

The cost per month for the additional months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The total cost for the additional months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we calculate the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his original salary and add it to his original salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Since the bonus is worth half a month's salary, the bonus will be:
Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Total annual salary with the bonus = (New monthly salary * 12) + Bonus
Total annual salary with the bonus = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary with the bonus = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary with the bonus = $262,500

"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately and then add them together.

The cost of the suits is 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500.

The cost of the dress pants is 10 dress pants * (1/5 * $750) per dress pant = 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Since James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, he buys a total of 10 suits * 3 dress shirts per suit = 30 dress shirts. The cost of the dress shirts is 30 dress shirts * $60 per dress shirt = $1,800.

Now, we add the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them covered and then add those distances together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Distance = Speed * Time. So, Alisa's distance = 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, Stanley's distance = 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance. Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance = 54 + 25 = 79 miles.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount would be 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142."

The total sales in the first month would be the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months would be the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as:
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by isolating 'g' in the second equation:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

The combined ages of all the children are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combine like terms: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5t = 30.

Divide by 5: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins: T = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
Total time before dinner = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year.
Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, we multiply the yearly savings by 10.

Rong's total savings = 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
Neil's total savings = 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved is the sum of their individual savings.

Total coins = Rong's savings + Neil's savings = 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. The two vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

We are given that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. We can set up the equation:

0.4x = $40

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check:

Heartworm check = 0.6 * $100
Heartworm check = $60

However, we already know the total bill is $100, so we can directly proceed to find out how much John leaves with. John brought $125 with him, and the total bill is $100, so:

Amount left = $125 - $100
Amount left = $25

"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

First, we know the cost of an apple is $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57.

Since each person will need a chair, the total number of chairs required is 57.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs required: 57 (required) - 48 (available) = 9.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find the hauling capacity of Gary's truck by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity. 

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find out how much they raise per hour. 

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find the hourly amount, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The remaining amount is the goal minus the amount already raised: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount: $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we add the hours they have already worked to the hours they still need to work: 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. We can set up an equation based on this information.

9x + 10 = 100

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation.

9x = 90

Next, we divide both sides by 9.

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first find the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

Total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 + 45
Total blue spools = 60

Total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total spools = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40%

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people were 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply 4 pieces by 30 days:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. 
The total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate her father's age as follows:
Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. Candidate C received 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube, and he makes 3 of them, so the total amount of water used for giant cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube, and he makes 7 of them, so the total amount of water used for medium cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube, and he makes 8 of them, so the total amount of water used for small cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books

She still has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She still has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for a total count. 29 large buttons * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding this to the 63 small buttons she has, we get 87 + 63 = 150 small buttons.

"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total hours available and the hours spent on other activities.

Total hours available: 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Hours spent reading: 3 hours

Remaining hours after reading: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Hours spent playing video games: 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Hours spent playing soccer: Remaining hours after reading and playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer:

Percentage spent playing soccer = (Hours spent playing soccer / Total hours) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the number of pencils he gave away to Brandon and Charlie.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils.

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils.

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

The number of pencils Anthony kept is 10.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

"To determine the number of wheels needed for the cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of wheels per car: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

To determine the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles, we multiply the number of motorcycles by the number of wheels per motorcycle: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Since Henry has 650 wheels in the box, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the different categories of movies and their respective costs.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies

The cost of these series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for these movies is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. We can calculate the number of older movies as:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. We can calculate the number of normal movies as:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add up the costs of all the movies:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30z
Points from time for Ava: 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between Ava's total points and Emma's total points:
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = -25

The final answer is: -25"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas. 

The total cost of the two pizzas is 30 dollars. Since there are two of them, we multiply 30 by 2 to get 60 dollars. 

Now, we subtract 60 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas, which is 64 dollars. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the information provided.

They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride in those 5 days is:
5 days * 3 times/day = 15 times

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. Since they usually ride 3 times a day, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times on each of those 2 days. 
So, the total number of times they ride in those 2 days is:
2 days * 6 times/day = 12 times

Now, we add the total number of times they ride in the 5 days and the 2 days:
15 times + 12 times = 27 times

Since there are 2 people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of times by 2:
27 times * 2 = 54 times

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought would be '2x'.

We know that he bought a total of 17 fish. So, the number of orange fish he bought plus the number of white fish he bought equals 17. This can be expressed as:

x + 2x = 17

Combine like terms:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17 / 3 is not a whole number, but since we are dealing with fish, we can try to find a whole number solution by considering the initial number of fish Bob had.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

The total number of orange fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish), and the total number of white fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish). Since the total number of fish is 24, we can set up the equation:

(3 + 2x) + (4 + x) = 24

"To determine the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of fuel consumed.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of trips per week is 2 (to and from work) * 5 (days) = 10 trips.

The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the total distance traveled per week is 10 trips * 10 miles (5 miles * 2) = 100 miles.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of fuel consumed per week is 100 miles / 10 MPG = 10 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 10 gallons * $3/gallon = $30.

The school is covering half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. This means John needs to pay the other half, which is also $150.

Since John already has $50, we subtract this from the amount he needs to pay: $150 - $50 = $100.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the nighttime temperature and the freezing point.

Temperature difference: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs: 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10 groups

Now, we are told that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6 groups

Since each group has 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back as follows:

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of members per group * Number of seashells per member
= 6 * 9 * 2
= 108

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so the number of people left on the train is:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on the train, so the total number of people on the train is:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so the number of people left on the train is:
138 - 38 = 100

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we divide 12 by 2 to get 6 male lions. 

Now, we add the number of female lions (12), male lions (6), and lion cubs (14) to get the total number of lions.

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% = 0.25). 

Discount amount = $40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find out how much money he will have left over.

Money left over = $50 - $30 = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:
$1,040,000 per month * 3 months
= $3,120,000

Total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months: $3,120,000"

The total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230
Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, so the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

Now, let's add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted: 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can first divide both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between the distances they traveled:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate of the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to find out the total number of square inches Milo can cover with the glass chips he has. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, the total number of chips he has is 2 * 72 = 144.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, the total number of square inches he can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we need to divide the total square inches by the height. 

Length = Total square inches / Height

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining amount of tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Adding the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount of tea consumed, we get 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. He then sold 150 candies, but since he didn't have them yet, this means he took orders for 150 candies. To fulfill these orders, he ordered 100 more candies. However, this still isn't enough to fulfill the 150 orders, so we can assume he will order more candies later.

The total number of candies Dale has ordered so far is 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

Since Dale took orders for 150 candies, and he has 200 candies, he still needs to sell the remaining candies. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50.

- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). 

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make a total of 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores by 2 (since there are two kids).

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person used and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'z' (since it's the same as zest), the amount of salt as '2z' (twice the amount of zest), the amount of sugar as '2z' (same as salt), and the amount of oil as '4z' (twice the amount of salt).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of the mixture, which is 10 ounces. 

z (zest) + z (fragrance) + 2z (salt) + 2z (sugar) + 4z (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. We can set up an equation to represent this:

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20. The total cost of the items she purchased is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the cost of the items from her total amount of money: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities into hours and minutes, then convert everything to hours.

1. Recording TikTok videos: 
   18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Convert minutes to hours: 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours/week
   For a month with 4 weeks: 1.2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 4.8 hours/month

2. Writing amateur songs:
   2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours/month

3. Doing makeup:
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Convert minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
   For a month with 4 weeks: 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6 hours/month

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
4.8 hours/month (recording) + 8 hours/month (writing songs) + 6 hours/month (makeup) = 18.8 hours/month

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first leg of his journey and the second leg, then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

In the first leg, Mason traveled at 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. 
Distance in the first leg = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

In the second leg, Mason traveled at 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. 
Distance in the second leg = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first leg + Distance in the second leg
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

Time taken by one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if the turtles are traveling at half the speed, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance.

Time taken by one turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours per turtle.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by four turtles will be the same as the time taken by one turtle.

Time taken by four turtles = 12 hours.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each individual to find the total number of clay dishes made by all three:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in discount.

The laptop costs $600, but with the trade-in discount, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Since we know that $230 of this amount comes from her part-time job and her mom, the amount she has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam obtained from the large and small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam sliced 3 large apples. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam sliced 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples to get the overall total. 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total. 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk his current cows produce. 

The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it has been used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it has been used. 
1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that have been used to find the total length used.
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks
Total number of dishes = 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

Next, we need to find the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only, we can subtract these from the total to find the number of students good at both subjects.

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 students good at both math and English.

Now, we can add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English to find the total number of students good at math.

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time required for each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equal to 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time required for each group (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform:

"To solve this problem, let's assign variables to each person's age. Let's say the brother's age is B, the sister's age is S, and the speaker's (your) age is Y. The mom's age is M.

From the given information, we know:
1. Y = B - 3 (You are three years younger than your brother)
2. Y = S + 2 (You are 2 years older than your sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (Mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
4. B + S + Y + M = 87 (When you add all our ages, you get 87)

We can express S and M in terms of B:
S = Y - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5
M = 3B - 1

Now, substitute S and M in terms of B into the equation B + S + Y + M = 87:
B + (B - 5) + (B - 3) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs and then find out how many boxes of jello he needs to buy.

Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

The cost of jello is $1.25 per box, so the total cost will be:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find the change the seller will give back, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given by the buyer.

The total cost of the phones is 5 * $700 = $3500.

The buyer gave the seller $4000.

The change the seller will give back is $4000 - $3500 = $500.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine the total amount Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we calculate 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Now, we know Keenan spends $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week in a four-week month, we divide the monthly cost by 4:
$160 / 4 = $40

"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of each.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money David has left after paying for the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. So, the total cost of the bolts is:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

"To find the number of marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul had 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so the total number of marbles Paul has now is 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we can divide 80 by 4, which is 20. So, Paul lost 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the number of marbles Paul lost from the total number of marbles he had: 80 - 20 = 60.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points.

True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points.

Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he will sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180 chickens

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens at $50 each. To find the total selling price, we can multiply the number of chickens to be sold by the selling price:

Total selling price = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost price:

Total selling price = Total cost price + Profit
$9000 = Total cost price + $2000

Now, we can solve for the total cost price:

Total cost price = $9000 - $2000
= $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we first need to determine the total number of glasses sold by the boys. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. 

Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2. So, 18 / 2 = 9 glasses per boy. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. 14 - 9 = 5.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money she will get from selling the rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and we need to find out how many meters of rope she can buy with the $40. To do this, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost per meter:
$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters

Since we know the length of the new rope she can buy, we can calculate the cost of the new rope:
26.67 meters * $1.5/meter = $40

However, this is not the correct approach. We should calculate the cost of a rope of the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we can find out how much money she will have left over after buying the new rope:
$40 - $30 = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age means 3 times her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since Melanie is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her to be 24 years old. We can subtract her current age from 24 to find the answer.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide the result by 2, since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as x. Then, the final concert's runtime without the encore would be 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, we get 2x + 15 = 65.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get 2x = 50.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 25.

The length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes."

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3: (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

She then placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the total number of cookies left by the number of jars.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

"To find the total number of petals for each type of flower, we need to multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower.

For the orchids: 5 flowers * 5 petals per flower = 25 petals
For the daisies: 4 flowers * 10 petals per flower = 40 petals

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids. 
40 (daisies) - 25 (orchids) = 15

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants: 
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants: 
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find the cost of one carrot, we first need to determine the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. Therefore, Kamala paid her 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So Alba paid her 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns. 
Total mowing earnings = Joe's payment + Kamala's payment + Alba's payment
Total mowing earnings = $6 + $18 + $30
Total mowing earnings = $54

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade. 
Total earnings = Mowing earnings + Lemonade earnings
$80 = $54 + Lemonade earnings
Lemonade earnings = $80 - $54
Lemonade earnings = $26

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first determine his total monthly earnings from renting out his car. 

He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours his car is rented out per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly earnings from renting out his car is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total monthly earnings to find his profit: $750 - $500 = $250.

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by adding 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding Dijana's distance and Anis' distance.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first. 

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will be eating with their two children, the total number of bowls used for dinner will be 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls were used for dinner, the leftover soup can fill 8 - 4 = 4 child's bowls.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 4 child's bowls of leftover soup, each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, we multiply the number of sets by the material required per set: 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the exact material needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, we multiply the number of sets by the material required per set and then multiply by the remaining masks: 2 * 2.25 = 4.5 yards for 6 masks, and for the remaining 2 masks, we calculate the material needed as (2/3) * 2.25 = 1.5 yards. So, the total material needed for the large masks is 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material required for the small and large masks: 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of the two farms:

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, his hourly earnings would be 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

To find out his total earnings in an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works: $8 * 8 = $64.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time taken to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (or 30 minutes), we need to divide the total time taken to solve the extreme sudoku by 30 to find out how many bottles of water he drinks. 

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of John as 'x'. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age will be 'x + 10'. 

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. Therefore, Peter's age will be 'x + (x + 10)'.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years. So, we can write the equation as follows:
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:
3x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3x = 80

Divide by 3:
x = 26.67

Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 26.67 + 10 = 36.67. 

Now, we can find Peter's age, which is the sum of Paul and John's age:
Peter's age = 26.67 + 36.67 = 63.33

However, since age is typically represented as a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number for a more realistic answer.

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spits their seeds. 

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so her total distance is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so her total distance is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the average of these two total distances. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance = 820 / 2
Average total distance = 410

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so the total number of hours in a month is 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
The cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he will be charged for 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5). The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option: 
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To determine how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

Finally, we can calculate how many 25-dollar pens he can buy with his remaining earnings:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in his words is 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters in Craig's words. The total number of letters in Craig's brother's words is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in Craig's words and his brother's words. The total number of letters is 300 + 350 = 650.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles she has after redeeming the coupons. 

Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

The teacher gives each of the 29 pupils 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the pupils is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the pupils from the total number of bottles the teacher has: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is 3 * $35 = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, and the amount he got back from selling the CDs.

The total cost of the CDs without the discount is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

With a 40% discount, James saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sold 5 CDs for $40. To find the cost of these 5 CDs, we need to calculate the cost per CD after the discount, which is $90 / 10 CDs = $9 per CD. The cost of the 5 CDs he sold is 5 CDs * $9 per CD = $45.

Since James sold the 5 CDs for $40, he lost $45 - $40 = $5 on the sale.

However, we need to consider the total amount he was out, which includes the cost of the remaining 5 CDs he kept. The total amount he was out is the cost of all the CDs minus the amount he got back from selling the 5 CDs, which is $90 - $40 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. This simplifies to D = A + 10.

Now, we can substitute B and D in terms of A into the equation A + B + D = 45. This gives us A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches, which is 1.5 inches. 

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15, which is 60.

Now, we multiply the number of 15-minute intervals (60) by the number of reports stapled per interval (30). 

60 * 30 = 1800

The total number of reports stapled is 1800."

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so the actual time she slept is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also woke up and sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. Subtracting this from the total time, we get 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons he initially had. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:
2/3 * 24 = 16

So, Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. 
1/5 of 1000 is 200, so 200 beds are initially occupied. 
The number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800.

Now, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks to find the new total number of occupied beds. 
200 (initial occupied) + 700 (new patients) = 900.

Finally, we subtract the new total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the total number of unoccupied beds.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then determine the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write an equation:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation:
S = 4A - 13

We are also given that the total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339, so we can write a third equation:
A + S + X = 339

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
A + 2S = 334

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334

Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 = 334

Combine like terms:
9A - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the initial distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first and third segments and subtract the distance traveled in the second segment to find the net distance:

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and then calculate the number of states in India.

The United States of America has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
Number of states in India = 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries together by adding the number of states in the USA and India:
Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard must have 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries combined. 

So, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 30 - 10 = 20.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days, then multiply by their respective prices.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total earnings: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and multiply it by the amount of sunscreen she reapplies each hour.

Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours she will be outside is 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour, the total amount of sunscreen she will need is 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces.

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will need by the amount in each bottle to determine how many bottles she will need: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

The price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

The total cost of both cars is $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old. 

Since he will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find out his dad's current age. Since Emil will turn 24 in 5 years, his dad will also be 5 years older in 5 years. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

We also know that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find out his brother's current age. Since Emil will turn 24 in 5 years, his brother will also be 5 years older in 5 years. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24 students.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which includes football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members
= 6 + 6

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant (30 inches) to find out how many plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, so Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

"To determine the total cost of filling the 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine wants 3 in each basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine wants 2 in each basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the 5 hanging baskets is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they bought to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (soil used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant:

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 to get her yearly savings. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck. 25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month. 

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, then multiply that by the time it takes her to sauté one group.

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per group = 3 groups
3 groups * 10 minutes per group = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them.

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes

"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the total change in temperature over the given time period.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling from the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This results in a total warming of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backward.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, we subtract 75 from 90 to find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.

90 - 75 = 15

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. 

So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * 88 = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The total remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22. 

Since the flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation: 
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants: 
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, 
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation: 
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants: 
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides: 
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

The lawyer will donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of slices. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x'. Therefore, the size of each adult's slice would be '2x'.

We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices can be represented as 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total that each adult's slice represents. Each adult's slice is 2x, and the total is 8x. 

So, the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is 2x / 8x = 1/4.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments and 30 minutes per appointment, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these activities: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic to get the time left to update records: 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

Volume = L * W * H
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we will do that.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.79
Charge before 3 hours = 35.44%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, when the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up another equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.44% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.44% / 0.59
Initial charge = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly earnings are $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

3 peaches at $0.5 each is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each is 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums Jamaar can buy by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of pieces she gave away. 

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

She gave the 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 / 10 = 78

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to consider the initial number of guests, the number of early and late checkouts, and the number of new check-ins.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:

100 - 24 = 76

15 guests opted for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so we don't subtract them yet.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 2 * 15 = 30. So, 30 new guests checked in.

76 (remaining guests) + 30 (new check-ins) = 106

After dinner, 7 more people checked in:

106 + 7 = 113

Now, we need to subtract the 15 guests who opted for a late checkout, as they are no longer in the hotel:

113 - 15 = 98

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she is sure to get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions by subtracting the number of easy questions from the total and dividing by 2. 
60 - 24 = 36 questions that are either average or difficult.
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct. 
She is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.
She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

In total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions correct.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To determine the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine per day with steel pickaxes:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

The original price of the new bedroom set is $3000. After using the $1000, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that probability from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance that she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30%), there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 30% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 
- Substitute teacher comes in: 50%
- Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension, and Marcus gets a personal extension: 6%

Total probability of not having to turn in homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract the probability of not having to turn it in from 100%:

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the fabric piece by multiplying the new length and width.

Area = length * width

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is 10.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. 
To find out how many gallons she drinks, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon: 
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of people at each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people became:
90 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, leaving:
190 - 80 = 110

Total number of people on the train at the final stop:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required to cover the area. 

Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt (1ft * 1ft). 

Given that the total area of your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire area (200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile).

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile: 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads he does per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads of twin sheets (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). He can do 1 load of king size sheets.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers. 
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats consume per day and then divide the total amount of food available by the daily consumption.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food each cat consumes per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 / 360 = 2.

We know Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

Total slices available from 4 pizzas with 8 slices each is 4 * 8 = 32 slices. Since they ate 31 slices, they ate almost all the slices.

"To find the length of Betsy's part, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts.

So, the equation becomes: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.
So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.
So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

The total number of pizzas left is 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station at time 0 (when the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes), we can calculate the total waiting time for Paul as the difference between the arrival time of the fourth train and the initial time.

Total waiting time = Arrival time of the fourth train - Initial time

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

First, let's calculate the time spent in class per day. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, making a total of 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday. So, the total extra learning time per week is 2 * (1/16) * 10080 = 1260 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent in class and the extra learning time to find the total time spent learning per week. The total time spent learning per week is 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes.

To convert the total time spent learning per week from minutes to hours, we divide by 60. The total time spent learning per week is 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours.

"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of one gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of one gallon of paint is $12, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 11 sodas left (3 shaken and 8 unshaken).

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100.

Likelihood = 0.25 * 100
= 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they travel to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps.
6 * 40 = 240

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people who arrived in cars and buses, and then add them together.

Number of people who arrived in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people
Number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Total number of people who arrived at the church: 60 people + 420 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the people who arrived at the church were the ones inside the church. However, we should also consider the bride and groom, who were already inside the church. Therefore, we need to add 2 to the total number of people.

Total number of people inside the church: 480 people + 2 people = 482 people

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
First, we convert the time for the breaks into minutes: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Then, we add the time for the lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the time per day by 5: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discounts.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00.
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to Sheila's balance:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, and that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * large jellyfish = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us:

large jellyfish = 18

We also know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us:

total jellyfish = 90

Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we do not have the value of x, we will assume she just started working and provide the answer as 40 years.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the total population based on the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total population = 240
0.4 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has to complete her journey. Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we can assume June has 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. If she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily total is 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she will cover in 30 days at her current rate: 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since Soledad's goal is 9,300 miles, we need to find the difference between her goal and her current total: 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

However, since she walks twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles per day by 2: 60 miles / 2 = 30 miles.

So, Soledad must hike 30 more miles per session to complete her journey on time.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of ball to find the total amount the store will receive: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

Since Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, we calculate 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg for Paul.

Now, we add the kilograms given to Peter and Paul: 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, we subtract the kilograms given to Peter and Paul from the total: 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

After buying the two books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. This means that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the two books by 2 to find the cost of each book.

"To find out how many eggs Camden painted compared to Arnold, we first need to determine the number of eggs each person painted. 

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number, we can divide 26 by 2 to find the number of eggs each of them painted:

26 / 2 = 13

Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by the number of crayons per box (8). 

200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the combined weight: 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the number of logs John can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, John can make 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes (given)
So, x = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20) miles/minute = 1 mile / (1/10) miles/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. This is $60 - $32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Jane to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4). 

$28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of heat transfer and the final temperature of the mixture. When Donny pours water from the two mugs into his water bottle, the resulting temperature will be a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.

Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x. We know that the final temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, and that the ratio of the water from the 33-degree mug to the water from the second mug is 4:1.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 68

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell will receive a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs with 9 bagels each, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, or 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes make 18 scoops, we need to divide 18 by 2 and multiply by 3. 

18 / 2 = 9
9 * 3 = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, which means there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 jellybeans.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9 blue jellybeans.

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade, so the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the initial number of women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by the total parts in the ratio (14) to find the value of one part. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

Initial number of women = 6 * 9 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

Adam has $100 to invest in the rock stand. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

If he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * $5 = $100.

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is 12 * $7 = $84.

To find the amount of money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost: $100 - $84 = $16.

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. The most efficient way to do this is to work on the scenes that take the longest to complete first.

Lauren can work on large-sized scenes for 9 days, then work on small-sized scenes for 7 days, and finally work on medium-sized scenes for 6 days. However, she can work on medium-sized scenes while working on the remaining large-sized scenes. 

So, the total number of days required is 9 days (for large-sized scenes) + 7 days (for small-sized scenes) - 3 days (since she can work on medium-sized scenes in the last 3 days of the large-sized scenes) = 13 days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, which has a 20% chance of winning, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.12 * 100 = 12%

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Since Carla has octuplets, there are 8 babies in total. 

3/4 of the babies wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
1/4 of the babies wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. 
All the blue-wearers wear bows: 2 babies
1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total production for 10 years:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Length of blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

To find x, we can solve the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15
$15 - x = $12
x = $3

So, they each gave their little sister $3.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods you get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is worth $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has left is 20 * $20 = $400.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill: $1200 / $5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be 2 inches or less.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. 
20% of the original 5 inches is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

However, we need to calculate 20% of the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) for each day. 
20% of 2.75 inches is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many 0.55-inch increments are there in 0.75 inches (2.75 - 2 inches).
0.75 / 0.55 = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a day).

However, this is the number of days it takes to go from 2.75 inches to 2 inches. We need to add 1 day for the day when the chalk will be 2 inches and the teacher will still be able to use it.

So, the total number of days is 1 (day when the chalk will be 2 inches) + 1 (the day when the chalk went from 2.75 to 2 inches, but we actually need to round up the 1.36 days to 2 days since we can't have a fraction of a day and the teacher will use the chalk for the full day) = 3 days, but we actually need to round up the 1.36 days to 2 days and add 1 day for the day when the chalk will be 2 inches and the teacher will still be able to use it, so the total number of days is 2 + 1 = 3 days, but the teacher used the chalk on Monday, so we need to add 1 day for Monday.

The total number of days is 3 + 1 = 4 days, but we actually need to round up the 1.36 days to 2 days and add 1 day for the day when the chalk will be 2 inches and the teacher will still be able to use it and add 1 day for Monday, so the total number of days is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 days.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the total number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to find out the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then determine the amount of milk that was returned.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon. 
Total amount = 4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000.

Since 2/5 of the milk was returned, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount of milk purchased.
Amount of milk returned = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount of milk returned by the cost per gallon.
Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write the equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write the equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + (35/3)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find the cost per book, we divide $500 by 100 books:

$500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book:

$27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find the number of books per school:

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of cheese slices required is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Each friend also eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni slices required is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas required is 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per hour, we need to multiply the melting rate per 15 minutes by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour). So, 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Now, we can calculate Jay's net snowball production rate per hour by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour.

To find the time it takes Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by his net production rate (12 snowballs/hour): 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since Digimon's 20th anniversary is being mentioned, we can assume that 20 years have passed since it first came out.

When Digimon first came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's denote Jim's age at that time as x. Then, John's age at that time would be 2x.

Since John is 28 now, we can set up an equation to find their ages 20 years ago:

John's current age = John's age 20 years ago + 20
28 = 2x + 20

Subtract 20 from both sides:
8 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:
4 = x

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon first came out, and John was 8 years old.

To find Jim's current age, add 20 years to his age at that time:
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 + 38 = 169 bandages. Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have had 169 - 50 = 119 bandages initially.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to first calculate her total hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate. 

Since Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week, her total hours worked per week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours. 

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will receive the additional $10 for each week. So, she will receive 4 * $10 = $40.

Her total earnings for April will be $270 + $40 = $310.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan also changes half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. 

The volume of the jar is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches. 

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches each and they get about 80% efficiency in packing, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 540 * 0.8 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the total number of red jelly beans in the jar is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. 

The difference between the true number and Tim's estimated number is 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

In the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 5 * 3 * 2 = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next 3 years, Pauline continued to visit the museum 3 times a year, and the new cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 3 * 3 * 5 = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, the number of groups required is:
40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Each group uses 45 minutes to try the escape room, so the total time required is:
5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):
4x = 4 * 8
= 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, and there are five people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Next, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year, so we add that to the total:
36 issues/year + 6 issues/year = 42 issues/year

Lastly, the last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is:
4 * 6 issues/year = 24 issues/year

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the discount.

The initial price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%, which means the new price is 180% of the initial price (100% + 80% increase). 

Price in December = Initial price * (100% + 80%) 
Price in December = $40 * 1.8 
Price in December = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, which means the new price is 50% of the price in December (100% - 50% decrease).

Price in January = Price in December * (100% - 50%) 
Price in January = $72 * 0.5 
Price in January = $36

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so his earnings from these lessons are:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 25% less than his standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons at this reduced rate, so his earnings from these lessons are:

Discounted price = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the discounted price to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the discounted price by 100.

Discounted price in cents = $15.00 * 100
Discounted price in cents = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the discounted price in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone. 

Since the main phone costs $20 and it costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

First, we need to find the total number of doughnuts made per day. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of doughnuts made per day is:
10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts sold per day is also 120.

Next, we need to find the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts sold in June:
120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June:
3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

John's initial speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. 

New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speaking speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people was 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the total number of people was 2 * 70 = 140.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the number of people Conor saw each day:

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the total number of popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

The initial price of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for each half of his collection and then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of his collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy. So, the amount he would get for the first half is 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half of his collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy. So, the amount he would get for the second half is 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts he would get for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to determine the total number of holes the dog dug. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's average enrollment as follows:

Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Norman High School's average enrollment - Butler High School's average enrollment
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 (rainbow) + 3075 (oatmeal) = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered. Since he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

We know that Igor gathered 7 beakers initially, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers he lost as x. Then, the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. We can set up an equation to represent this:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + (7 - x) (beakers) = 29

Combine like terms:

24 + 7 - x = 29

Combine constants:

31 - x = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:

-x = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, and he needs 32 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run 2 miles (half of Vanessa's distance).

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

We are also given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute, the time she took to complete her part of the race is 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to determine the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price with a 25% profit.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we need to calculate the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we find 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price:

Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 * $1.60
= $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price + Profit
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Given that James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Since John was 19 years old when James was born, and James is currently 18 years old, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in 60 minutes.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor costs $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find the number of cows:

w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to determine the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends). There are 4 people in total.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

56 / 4 = 14"
