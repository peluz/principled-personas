"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating 3 for breakfast and baking muffins with 4 eggs. 
Total eggs laid per day = 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3
Eggs used for baking muffins = 4
Total eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7
Eggs left to sell = Total eggs laid per day - Total eggs used
Eggs left to sell = 16 - 7
Eggs left to sell = 9

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Janet makes by selling the eggs at the farmers' market.
Price per egg = $2
Total money made = Eggs left to sell * Price per egg
Total money made = 9 * $2
Total money made = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we can add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase).

New value = 250% of $80,000
New value = 2.5 * $80,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh was the original price of the house plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. 

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. So, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 9 = 180 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can group the remaining 14 glasses into 7 pairs. Each pair consists of a full-priced glass and a discounted glass.

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 
The cost of 7 pairs is 7 * $8 = $56.

Adding the cost of the first two glasses ($5 + $3 = $8) to the cost of the remaining 14 glasses ($56), we get:
$8 + $56 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drove at 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance covered in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance John covered in the initial 3 hours. Since he drove at 60 mph for 3 hours, the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since John turned around and drove back, the distance he is from home is the difference between the distance he initially covered and the distance he covered in the 4 hours:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.50 * 3 = $31.50

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first two years. However, in the third year, the total revenue ($31.50) is still less than the total cost ($99). 

Let's calculate for the next year:
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.50 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.50 * 5 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.50 * 6 = $63
Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.50 * 7 = $73.50
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.50 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.50 * 9 = $94.50
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.50 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.50 * 11 = $115.50
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.50 * 12 = $126
Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.50 * 13 = $136.50

In the 13th year, the total revenue ($136.50) is greater than the total cost ($129), so Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree after 13 years.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

The remaining students after contemporary dance enrollment: 
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 
20 - 4 (contemporary) - 4 (jazz) = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances covered on both days.

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

84 / 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at the time of his son's birth

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his lego sets and the total amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount he spent plus the amount he had left should equal the total amount he made: $160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and spent $165, he must have spent the remaining $30 on something else or kept it, but it's not relevant to the question. The question is how many lego sets he still has.

Since John sold his lego sets for $15 each and he made $195, we can calculate the number of lego sets he sold: $195 / $15 = 13.

However, the question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his lego sets, the answer is 0.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running and walking speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, if she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame range.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the safe distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles written in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units:
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books will weigh 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find their combined weights, we first need to find Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:
3 * 25 = 75

Then, multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose:
75 * 8 = 600

Total number of thorns: 600"
"To find out how many games the football team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is equal to 22.

x (games lost) + (x + 8) (games won) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find out how many games they won:
Games won = x + 8
Games won = 7 + 8
Games won = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase. 
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
Her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.

However, this increase happens every year for the next three years. 
After the first year, her monthly salary will be $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $726.
After the second year, her monthly salary will be $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $798.6.
After the third year, her monthly salary will be $798.6 + 0.1 * $798.6 = $878.46.

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary.
Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Given Amy's age is 9, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. We can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the canned tomatoes before they were cooked into sauce. Since the sauce lost half its volume, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. 

The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. Twice that volume is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the canned tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces). 

64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains three tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.

4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also has a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

The number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed, we need to find the total time it took her to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds. 

We can set up a proportion to find the total distance rowed: 
(16 seconds / 20 feet) = (64 seconds / x feet)
Cross-multiplying, we get:
16x = 64 * 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. 
We can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals:
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters:

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary four years ago = Lylah's salary four years ago + 30% of Lylah's salary four years ago
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since we don't know the percentage increase in Lylah's salary, we will assume it increased simultaneously with Adrien's, but we don't have enough information to calculate the exact percentage increase. However, we can assume that the percentage increase is the same for both, which is 40% in this case.

New salary of Lylah = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary of Lylah = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary of Lylah = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary of Lylah = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped (20) from the total number of already-stamped letters (30). 

30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to add the 3 spoons she used back to the 7 spoons.

7 (spoons before husband's purchase) + 3 (spoons used) = 10 spoons

Therefore, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages and add it to the number of chicken sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated by the hospital.

Total patients per day: 500
Average time spent per patient: 24 minutes
Total time spent by doctors per day: 500 * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue generated by the hospital is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost incurred by the hospital is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = Total unicorns * (1/3)
Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. We can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Female Scottish unicorns = Unicorns in Scottish Highlands * (2/3)
Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive flew from the hive and left. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
So, the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees.
However, 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours. So, the number of bees that left and hadn't returned before the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months.

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the price increase every 2 months is $4.

Since there are 18 intervals, we can calculate the total price increase as follows:
$4 * 18 = $72

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the price after 36 months, as the price increase is 20% of the original price every 2 months, not a fixed amount.

To calculate the correct price, we need to calculate the price increase for each interval:
- After 2 months: $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
- After 4 months: $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
- After 6 months: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
- ...
We can see that the price increase is not a fixed amount, but rather a percentage of the previous price.

To simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for compound interest:
A = P * (1 + r)^n

where A is the final price, P is the original price, r is the interest rate (20% in this case), and n is the number of intervals.

In this case, P = $20, r = 0.20, and n = 18.

A = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20 * 7.485
A ≈ $149.70

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the cost of doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would have earned her $35 per hour. So, the total lost income is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If she hires the accountant, she will pay $90.

The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is $105 - $90 = $15.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Number of flans: 15
Number of eggs per flan: 3
Total eggs needed: 15 * 3 = 45

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 insects. So, the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

The rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them. So, the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total payment per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the total payment per year, we multiply the total payment per month by 12.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

First, let's find out how many gallons they made. They made $25 in profit, and they sell each glass for $0.50. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, they make $10 per gallon (20 glasses * $0.50 per glass). 

Their total revenue is the profit plus the total cost. The total cost for each gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which is $5 per gallon. 

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. Then, their total revenue is $10x and their total cost is $5x. Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5 gallons

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. They spent $3 per gallon on lemons, so they spent a total of:

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 5:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

"To determine the total time for the well-rounded team, we need to multiply the time of one runner by 4 since all runners have the same time. 

Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up. 

The first runner runs in 60 seconds. 
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. 
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. 
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team. 

Time difference = Total time for the less well-rounded team - Total time for the well-rounded team = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of this event. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

Next, we need to find the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 or 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6). To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers. Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance covered in the next three weeks is 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the distance covered in the first four weeks and the next three weeks to find the total distance: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar:
40g / 2 = 20g per candied apple

There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is 240 cups (20 * 12), we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240 to find the cost of each cup: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

In the last 4 minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

Current amount of water in the small pool = 24 - 16 = 8 gallons

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
The total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes. 
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

- 40 water type

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

Total cards after losing 8 water type = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:

Total cards after buying 14 grass type = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can represent the total number of fish as 2x, where x is the number of fish in each aquarium.

We can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x

Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 * 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

Now, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound to find the total cost.
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 * $1.50
Total cost = $300

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories each of them consumed:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's total calories from Sue's total calories:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:
Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
Total animals: 25 + 48 = 73

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the cows. So, the initial 10 stalls with 20 cows each now have a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 (initial) + 2 (new) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%) and subtract the result from the total weight.

Weight eaten by termites = 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Weight of the tree after termites ate 30% = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Weight of the tree: 5600"

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal. 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are required for the total number of cookies she's making.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, for a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of cups needed per cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies:

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies Carla is making by the amount of flour needed per cookie:

66 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 66 * 1/6 = 11 cups

So Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees and then the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we find the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 
So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes break = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then apply the extra point rule.

Mike has 21 points after the third round. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's apply the extra point rule. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed:
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is the sum of their ages, which is 8 + 4 = 12.

Will bought 15 oranges, and his sons washed 12. To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises he did each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total exercises from both days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates."
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total number of bids and the final bid amount. 

Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200. Then, 3 other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 4 rounds of bidding after the initial bid. 

The bids rise by $50 each time. So, the bid amounts after each round are:
- Round 1: $200 (initial bid) + $50 = $250
- Round 2: $250 + $50 = $300
- Round 3: $300 + $50 = $350
- Round 4: $350 + $50 = $400

Since Carmen wins the desk after the 4th round, the final bid amount is $400.

"To calculate the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day:
Distance to work = 30 miles
Since John goes to work and back, the total miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles

Now, let's calculate the total miles driven per year:
Total miles driven per day = 60 miles
Number of days worked per week = 5 days
Number of weeks worked per year = 50 weeks
Total miles driven per year = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven per year = 15,000 miles
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:
Bonus per month = $150
Number of months in a year = 12
Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year including the bonus:
Total cost of driving per year = $30,000
Total bonus per year = $1,800
Total cost of driving per year including bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To find the total amount of time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday, we need to add the time he spent exercising on those days. 

Time spent exercising on Sunday: 23 minutes
Time spent exercising on Monday: 16 minutes
Total time spent exercising on Sunday and Monday: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

Time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 and 32 (back and front)
- Page 2 and 31 (back and front)
- Page 3 and 30 (back and front)
- ...
- Page 16 and 17 (back and front)

This pattern continues until all 32 pages are paired. Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 for rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings in April, we need to consider both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in April. Assuming a 4-week month (which is a reasonable assumption for April), Watson works 5 days a week, 10 hours a day. 

Total hours worked per week = 5 days * 10 hours/day = 50 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage:
Hourly wage = $10/hour
Total earnings from hourly wage = 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
Total bonus in April = $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's calculate his total earnings in April:
Total earnings in April = Total earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus in April
Total earnings in April = $2000 + $1200
Total earnings in April = $3200

80% of 20 = 0.8 * 20 = 16

Since John beat 16 people, he must have lost to the remaining people. 
Number of people he lost to = Total people - Number of people he beat

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.
3. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves of bread for the rest of the day.
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.
5. Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. Five times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than that, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
$600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. So, the amount he has available to spend is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, let's calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners: 
$4000 (available to spend) - $1950 (total expenses) = $2050

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + D + D/2) / 2 = 105 / 2
(9D/2) / 2 = 105 / 2
9D/4 = 105 / 2
9D = 105 * 2
9D = 210
D = 210 / 9
D = 70/3
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number that can be divided evenly by 3 (to account for the half on special teams), which is 21 for the defense, but that would leave a remainder when calculating the offense and special teams. The next number is 24 for the defense but that would also leave a remainder when calculating the offense and special teams.

"To find the total number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and subtract those who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12
- 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people due to previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

Now, let's subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 - 10 = 14

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:
Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost:
Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Number of boys = 30

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, 
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
= 3 * 30
= 90

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys,
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = x (poles) / 45 (wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Total number of electric poles required: 15"
"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:
1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
10 - 3 = 7 women

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is:
15 - 7 = 8

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Since Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, and a total of 26 pencils, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total to get the number of pencils in the boxes. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes

Since there are 3 boxes, we divide the number of pencils in the boxes by 3 to get the number of pencils in each box.

24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box

Now, we know that each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we add the total number of pencils they have and divide by the number of pencils per box.

Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. 

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box.

72 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 9 boxes

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to determine how many new records each person got and then calculate the total number of old records they traded.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new one, we can set up a proportion to find out how many old records were traded for 7 new records.

Let's first find out how many sets of 2 old records were traded for 7 new records. Since 2 old records = 1 new record, we can divide 7 new records by 1 to find the number of sets of 2 old records traded.

7 new records / 1 new record per 2 old records = 7 sets of 2 old records

Now, we multiply the number of sets of 2 old records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 sets of 2 old records * 2 old records per set = 14 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

However, this is incorrect as the 60 would include non-programmers. We need to find the total number of programmers first. Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x. The number of non-programmers is 100 - x.

We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so we can set up the equation:
2/5 * 100 = 2/5 * x + (number of junior programmers that are not part of the x programmers)
However, this equation is not needed as we can simply use the proportion of junior programmers to the total number of employees to find the total number of programmers.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * x
40 = 2/5 * x
x = 100

So the total number of programmers is 100, which is the same as the total number of employees. This is incorrect as the problem implies that there are non-programmers. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40
Number of programmers = x

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

Time = (40 percentage-points) * (3 minutes/percentage-point) = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received on this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they earn $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which gave them a $4 discount. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount they received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

For Job A:
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000/year

For Job B:
- Gross income: $42,000/year
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before income tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

Difference in net income: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, since there are two different names for Richard, we will assume that RJ and Richard are the same person, and the correct number of guns Richard has is 1 (RJ) or 5 (Richard). We will use 5 for Richard in this case, but note that 1 could also be correct.

The total number of guns is 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) is not used, 5 (Richard) is used instead + 5 (Richard) = 8 + 10 + 5 = 23 guns.

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

23 guns / 4 people = 5.75 guns per person.

Since you can't have a fraction of a gun, we round down to 5 guns per person, with 3 guns left over."

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the frames is:
44 * $20 = $880

Since each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, we need to calculate the etching cost:
20% of $880 = 0.20 * $880 = $176

So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is:
$880 + $176 = $1056

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each:
2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is:
44 / 4 = 11 seniors

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:
11 * $12 = $132

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts:
$1056 (frames with etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50

Total number of tennis shoes sold: 50"
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

- Tuesdays: 1 hour
- Thursdays: 2 hours

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

A dozen is equal to 12. Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls and gave one to each of her 6 children. So, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 
6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, it's (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time 
= $3,650 * 4.17% 
= $3,650 * 0.0417 
= $152.105 

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
= $3,650 + $152.105 
= $3,802.105 

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = $3,802.105 / 5 
= $760.421 

Rounded to two decimal places, the monthly payment is approximately $760.42.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can multiply the value of one part by the respective parts to find the number of popsicles each has. 
Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To calculate the savings, we need to first determine the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling. 
The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The 20% discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

She spent half that time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spent 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. 

Initially, Erica had 20 (cards she made) + 30 (cards her dad brought) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, Erica has 50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards passed out) = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 (cards she had) + 17 (cards received) = 38 cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and Jenny's portion.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since there are 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

In total, Bill and Mark have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is 7 (Bill and Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

There are 12 slices in total, and 9 slices have been eaten or given away. So, the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day and then the energy saved per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day.

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by 4.

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Total meat required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of meat per sandwich
Total meat required = 5 * 1
Total meat required = 5 pounds

Total cheese required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of cheese per sandwich
Total cheese required = 5 * 1
Total cheese required = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the total weight of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound.

Total cost of meat = Total meat required * Cost of meat per pound
Total cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total cheese required * Cost of cheese per pound
Total cost of cheese = 5 * $3.00

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, the total number of corns is 80 + 60 = 140.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract it from the initial $10.

The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of Sally's purchases: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 cookies * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per recipe = 5 recipes.

Since each recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we can say that Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that meet both conditions.

First, we know that 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode (since they are 99% guaranteed not to explode). So, the number of candles that will explode is 1% of 50000, which is:
50000 * 0.01 = 500

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since there are 500 candles that will explode, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 5% of 500, which is:
500 * 0.05 = 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = $14 * 4 
= $56

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

To find the number of apples gathered from the average trees, we subtract the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the combined total. This is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this 350 apples is the total gathered by Joanne from the average trees and her sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees. Therefore, the 350 apples is the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into the first equation:
d = 180 - c
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
Size of Zack's locker = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Size of Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker
Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Size of Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months. However, we only need 8 months of this rate, so the cost is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, so the cost is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is the negative of that, but since the question asks ""how much more"" we are looking for the absolute difference in the other direction.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade) + 60 (store-bought) = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 * x.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 100, so we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of a candy bar: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

- Run: 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes = 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the run:

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time needs to be converted to hours, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, which he sold for $25 each. The revenue from the rest of the week is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the rest of the week:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each, then add them together.

Six packets had 8 pieces each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 pieces each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the popcorn with a soda costs $1 extra, so the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, let's consider the option of buying a regular ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda must be $21 - $2 = $19.

We know that the total cost of the regular ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15. To find the regular price of popcorn, we subtract this amount from the total cost: $19 - $15 = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. In this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then subtract the 50 cards she kept for herself. 

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. 

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. After keeping 50 cards for herself, she has 350 - 50 = 300 cards left to give to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given to the students (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10) to find out how many students Miss Maria has: 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes contains 2 shoes, we'll convert the pairs to individual shoes:
- 5 pairs on Monday = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
- 15 pairs on Wednesday = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

Now, let's add the shoes he received:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine Angela's age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in four years = 42

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 years from Angela's age in four years:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Paul drove his car for 14 days, so the total number of morning rides is 14, and the total number of afternoon rides is also 14.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.
The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation:
D = B/2

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation:
L + D + B = 43

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
L + (B/2) + B = 43

We can also substitute the second equation into the third equation:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43

Now, we can substitute the first equation into this equation:
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43

Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Bodhi found:
B = 2D
B = 2(9)
B = 18

Now that we know David and Bodhi's numbers, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. So, her grandma used 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For 2 x 4 wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8 wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 2 x 4 wood gives the most sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Frederick has $24 to buy wood. He can buy $24 / $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks, 6 pieces will give 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of her daily bus trips is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from her monthly goal.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Since Emma's goal is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the goal:

72 (monthly goal) - 54 (total vlogs made so far) = 18

"To find out how much you paid, we need to calculate the total amount you owe, including the 20% tip. 

First, we'll find the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 
20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Since you're paying the tip, you'll pay half of the dinner bill plus the tip. 
Half of the dinner bill = $50 / 2 = $25
Total amount you paid = $25 (half of the bill) + $10 (tip) = $35

"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He later spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first and second halves.

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April). Both halves have 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves. We can express this as:

15x (first half) + 15(2x) (second half) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since the daily savings in the second half is '2x', we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, his total earnings will be:
$0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings will be:
$0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings:
$16 - $10 = $6

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:

4x = 4(20)
= 80

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total miles walked per day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles per day.

Now, we multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days he works in a week, which is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process.

The alphabet has 26 letters. Elise writes it in full twice, which is 2 * 26 = 52 letters. Then, she writes half of it once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. 

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters (the full alphabet written twice) and the 13 letters (half of the alphabet). So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

In total, Elise has written 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. Five times that number is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. So, if we let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30 and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

For the remaining $1500, she earns a 40% commission (30% + 10%):
$1500 * 0.40 = $600

Total commission earned by Antonella:
$300 + $600 = $900

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants to have for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the comparison, as the question is asking for a comparison between hot and cold days, but the given information is for cold and warm days. Since we do not have information about hot water, we will assume the warm water time is the closest we have to hot water.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and warm water. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25

"To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to determine how much coffee Octavia and Juan currently drink.

The daily recommended cups of coffee is not explicitly stated, but we know Octavia drinks half of it. Let's call the daily recommended cups of coffee 'x'. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups for Juan. This implies that x = 4. 

Now we can calculate how much coffee Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommended cups from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the three friends: 
Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends: 
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as x. We can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

This is the nephew's age in 7 years. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from x:

Nephew's current age = 17 - 7
Nephew's current age = 10

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then add them to Richie's score.

We know Richie scored 80 goals. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's score by subtracting 20 from Richie's score:
Mark's score = Richie's score - 20
Mark's score = 80 - 20
Mark's score = 60

We also know Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's score, we can subtract 45 from Richie's score:
Anna's score = Richie's score - 45
Anna's score = 80 - 45
Anna's score = 35

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual scores:
Total goals = Richie's score + Mark's score + Anna's score
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide $70 by 7 to find out how much he can spend each day:

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since he spent $10 per day for 4 days, he spent a total of:

$10 * 4 = $40

He can buy wooden action figures with this money:

$40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left to spend ($70 - $40 = $30). He can buy plastic action figures with this money:

$30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 15 plastic action figures.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- First flower shop: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week
Total roses ordered per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of crayon muffins she can create. 

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be divided into equal small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon is not provided. 

We do know that Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. To find the total number of muffin crayons, we'll divide the total number of small pieces by 8. 

Since we don't know the exact number of small pieces per crayon, let's assume each crayon can be divided into 'x' small pieces. Then, the total number of small pieces is 192 * x. 

The total number of muffin crayons is (192 * x) / 8. 

However, we can simplify this by realizing that the number of small pieces per crayon (x) is not necessary to find the total number of muffin crayons. We can simply divide the total number of crayons by the number of small pieces per muffin crayon (8) and then multiply by the number of small pieces per crayon (x), which cancels out 'x'. 

So, the total number of muffin crayons is 192 / 8 = 24. 

Now, we can multiply the total number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make. 

Total money = 24 * $1.50 = $36.

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the total area of the bedroom and then multiply it by the cost of each component.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total area is:
18 ft * 12 ft = 216 sq ft

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, and the cost of padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the new carpet and padding is:
$12/sq ft + $2/sq ft = $14/sq ft
$14/sq ft * 216 sq ft = $3024

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is:
$4/sq ft * 216 sq ft = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is:
$34/sq ft * 216 sq ft = $7344

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet and padding, removal, and installation:
$3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

Now, we'll find the percentage by which the oven is off:
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we'll apply this percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees:

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the 10% discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price becomes:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 boxes * $90.00 per box = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since he buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair is:
$1.00 per contact * 2 contacts per pair = $2.00 per pair

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

Now, we can calculate the grams of protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to calculate the weight after the 50% increase and then subtract 2 pounds.

First, we calculate the 50% increase: 8 pounds * 0.5 = 4 pounds. 
Now, we add the 50% increase to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal uses a weight 2 pounds lighter: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them together.

Steve initially received 5 games with his console. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so in 3 years, he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games.

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has:
Initial games: 5
Christmas games: 15
Games bought in the first year: 12
Games bought in the second year: 24
Games bought in the third year: 48

Total number of games = 5 + 15 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 104

"To find the additional hours it would take to travel 2000 miles, we first need to determine the plane's speed. 

The plane's speed can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours). 

Speed = Distance / Time 
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours 
Speed = 400 miles per hour 

Now, we can use the plane's speed to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed 
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour 
Time = 5 hours 

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours:
120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production rate:
(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours) to find their total production:
Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:
720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade.
The total earnings from the first 4 hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade.
The total earnings from the next 2 hours are 20 * $0.60 = $12.

The total amount of money Patrick earned is $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations.

First, let's calculate the number of rotations per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month.

To find the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps as follows:

Total number of pumps = 2 pumps * 120 washings = 240 pumps

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

To convert the cost per pump to cents, we multiply by 100:

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional amount. 

Now, subtract the cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount:
$50 - $42 = $8

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the total number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. The cost per month for these additional months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

The cost per month for the additional months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The total cost for the additional months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Bonus for the year = $10,500 (assuming it's a one-time bonus, if it's annual, then it would be $10,500, if it's monthly, then it would be $10,500 * 12 = $126,000)

However, since the question asks for the total money he will make in a year, we will consider the bonus as a one-time payment.
Total money made in a year = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we first need to determine the amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Total flour in one bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we can find the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3.

Total flour in three bags = 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to calculate her sales from green hats. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can find the sales from green hats by multiplying the sales from red hats by 2.

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats.

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can find the total sales in the second month by multiplying the total sales in the first month by 3/4.

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * $1200
Total sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales in the first and second months.

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900

First, let's calculate the amount she actually received. We know her bank account had $200 at the start of the week and now holds $420. The difference between these two amounts is the amount she received this week.

$420 (current balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220 (amount received)

Since her weekly wage should be $300, we can now calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the amount she received from her expected wage.

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (amount received) = $80

"To determine the number of eggs Lori will need, we first need to find out the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to prepare. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of eggs Lori will need is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since eggs are usually sold in dozens, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens Lori will need is 24 / 12 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and each animal has one head. So, the total number of heads can be represented as:
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut. 

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:
Cost of normal brand = $5 per pound
Cost of more expensive brand = $5 + (20% of $5)

However, we are given that Christina had twelve good days in total over the past thirty days. Since we know the first eight days were good, we subtract those from the total good days to find the remaining good days in the last 22 days. 

12 (total good days) - 8 (good days in the first eight days) = 4 good days in the last 22 days.

We also know that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This accounts for two of the good days in the last 22 days.

"To find the total number of cookies in the box, we need to first determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the total number of children is 5. The combined ages of the twins are 2T, and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages of all the children is 44.

We can set up the equation: 2T + 3t = 44

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get:
2(t + 7) + 3t = 44
2t + 14 + 3t = 44
5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:
5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:
t = 6

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:
T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner and subtract the time he spends on his homework.

First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework: 
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time available before dinner:
Time available for napping = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time available for napping = 180 - 80
Time available for napping = 100 minutes

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
10 candies will cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:
Neil's savings = Rong's savings + (2/5 * Rong's savings)
Neil's savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings = 20 + 8
Neil's savings = 28 coins per month

Now, we need to calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = Rong's savings per month * 120
Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400

Neil's total savings = Neil's savings per month * 120
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
Neil's total savings = 3360

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
Total coins = 2400 + 3360
Total coins = 5760

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines are 40% of the total bill (since 100% - 60% = 40%). 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. This is 40% of the total bill.

To find the total bill, we can set up the equation: 
$40 = 0.4 * Total bill
Total bill = $40 / 0.4
Total bill = $100

Since John brought $125 with him, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, which is $1. So, the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of each type of fruit: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total number of squares in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has. 

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find Gary's truck capacity by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they still need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raised per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised. 

So, the total number of hours is 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours.

80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%:
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first find the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

Total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 + 45
Total blue spools = 60

Total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total spools = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. 
The total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages. 

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate it as follows:
Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate her age as follows:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total voters - Total votes received by candidates A and B

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube. Since he makes 3 giant cubes, he uses 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube. Since he makes 7 medium cubes, he uses 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube. Since he makes 8 small cubes, he uses 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books

$5 - $2 = $3

So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

= 10

Now, we know that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. The total number of students who have been accounted for so far is:

10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25

Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - Number of students who have been accounted for

Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students per class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

Girls per class = Students per class * 0.4
Girls per class = 40 * 0.4
Girls per class = 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we can subtract the number of girls per class from the total number of students per class.

He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
30 cards * $50/card = $1500

The total revenue from selling the cards is the sum of the values of all the cards:

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours taught are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so her earnings for the hours taught are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from his total goal to find out how much he needs to make from selling corn. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn.

$75 / 25 = $3

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. The family drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. 

Distance driven = Speed * Time 
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours 
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. The family hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour 
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Distance hiked = Speed * Time 
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours 
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Total distance to the vacation spot = Distance driven + Distance hiked 
Total distance to the vacation spot = 225 miles + 30 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 't' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 't - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30t
Points from time for Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between their total points:

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the days they ride twice as much.

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

On the days they ride twice as much (2 days), they ride twice the usual number of rides, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the days they ride twice as much:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Since there are two people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of rides by 2:
27 rides * 2 = 54 rides

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he already had 4 white fish, the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish he had initially was 3. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. The total number of orange fish is 3 + y.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + y = 8 + 2x

Subtract 3 from both sides:

y = 5 + 2x

We know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish (both white and orange). So, the sum of the white fish and orange fish he bought is 17:

x + y = 17

Substituting y from the previous equation:

x + (5 + 2x) = 17

Combine like terms:

3x + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide by 3:

x = 4

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he drives to work and back home from Monday to Friday, and then calculate the total amount of fuel consumed. 

The one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles. Since he drives to work and back home, the total distance per day is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles. 

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of fuel consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

3/5 of 10 twenties is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. 
Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters, and she spent all of them. 
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount spent from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups and then the number of members who brought seashells.

Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, the number of groups can be calculated as follows:
Number of groups = Total people / People per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
Number of groups with seashells = (3/5) * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members who brought seashells is:
Total members with seashells = Number of groups with seashells * People per group
Total members with seashells = 6 * 9
Total members with seashells = 54

Given that each member brought 2 seashells, the total number of seashells can be calculated as follows:

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so the number of stuffed goats (x) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x).

We can set up the equation as follows:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can first divide both sides by 100:
(x / (14 + x)) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

Expanding the equation:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining amount of tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount of tea consumed, we get:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To find out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he ordered 100 more, bringing the total to 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, Dale sold 150 candies before ordering the additional 100. So, the total number of candies he has now is 200, and he has already sold 150.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the number of marshmallows used and dropped from the original number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make a total of 14 S'mores. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
- Citrus zest: z
- Fragrance: z
- Salt: 2z
- Sugar: 2z
- Oil: 4z

Total amount = z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation: 
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
z = 1

Now that we know z, we can find the amount of oil:
Amount of oil = 4z = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially had. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold. Joe sold 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother. Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gave away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 / 20 students = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Then, during lunch, 1/2 of the cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply the total number of cars by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35.

Since 35 cars left, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during lunch is 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."

Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Each task pays $1.20, so John's weekly earnings are:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

"To find the number of cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:
Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine the number of trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
Total earnings = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of the total. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, the town will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, the town will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total is the sum of the homes built in the first two years (48) and the homes built in the third year (96). 

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 48 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Given that I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

Given that I am 2 years older than my sister, we can express this as:
A = S + 2

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can rewrite S as S = A - 2 and B as B = A + 3. 

Substituting B and S in the last equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
6A + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
6A = 78

Divide both sides by 6:
A = 13

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in a pack to find out the number of packs needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to consider the initial amount, the amount after the first increase, and the amount after the second increase.

The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add this increase to the amount after the first increase: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river at that point: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previously infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previously infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

"To find out how many books Fawn has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Anne has as 'A', Sofie as 'S', and Fawn as 'F'. 

We know that together they have 85 books, so A + S + F = 85.

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so S = A + 25.

Lastly, we know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so A = F - 12.

Now, we can substitute the values of S and A in terms of F into the first equation. 

Since A = F - 12, we can substitute S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13.

Now, we can substitute these values into the first equation: (F - 12) + (F + 13) + F = 85.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants: 
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants:

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total amount she made from mowing lawns: 
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: $18
- Alba's lawn: $30
Total from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the total amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $54 = $26

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of 50 miles, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages today. So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today.

Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their two children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in terms of child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small masks and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material needed for 4 masks. 
So, the material needed for 20 small masks is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material needed for 3 masks. 
So, the material needed for 8 large masks is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for small and large masks: 
10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

"To find the number of shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of shoe boxes used and subtract that from the total.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is 3. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is 3.

The number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * 9
Joseph's initial number of books = 18

Now, we subtract the 2 books Joseph lost from his initial number of books to find out how many books he currently has:

Joseph's current number of books = Joseph's initial number of books - 2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can start by substituting the second equation into the third equation to express P in terms of J:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P and L in the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:

P = L + J

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria). So, the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

"To determine the number of new tables needed, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits their seeds and then find the average of those two distances.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so her total distance is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so her total distance is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The average total distance spat is (400 + 420) / 2 = 410 feet.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so the total number of hours in a month is 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles she gets from the coupons. 

Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, the teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gives away is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles she gave away from the total number of bottles she got: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. So, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, and the amount he got back from selling the CDs.

The total cost of the CDs without the discount is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

With a 40% discount, James saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sold 5 CDs for $40, which means he got back $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 15 hours to minutes: 
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

We know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the reports stapled per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The total number of reports stapled is 1800.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons he initially had. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * Number of measuring cups

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons. He gifted Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons remaining is:

Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6

So, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
Initial occupied beds = 200
Additional occupied beds = 700
Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last leg = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:
Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries combined. To find Jerry's cherries, we subtract their total from the overall total:
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total:
Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days, then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total amount earned: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use by the amount in each bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100
Discount on the red car = 0.4 * $100
Discount on the red car = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost of both cars = $100 + $60
Total cost of both cars = $160

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then subtract 5 years from each of their ages to find their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's call his dad's age at that time ""x"". Since Emil is half his dad's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = x/2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 48

So, Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24.

We are also told that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24. Let's call his brother's age at that time ""y"". Since Emil is twice his brother's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = 2y

To solve for y, we divide both sides by 2:

y = 12

So, Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, we subtract 5 years from each of their ages at 24:

Dad's current age: 48 - 5 = 43
Brother's current age: 12 - 5 = 7

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant (30 inches) to find the total number of plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, so Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant:

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights to Greece. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend gives him $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 
Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by 15. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size '2x', we can calculate the percentage as (2x / 8x) * 100.

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 3 hours as follows:

Let x be the charge at the beginning of the 3 hours. Then, after 3 hours, the charge will be:
x - 3 * 7% = x - 21% = 28%

To find x, we can add 21% to both sides:
x = 28% + 21% = 49%

Now, let's go back to the first 5 hours, when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. We know that the charge at the end of these 5 hours is 49%. We can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 5 hours as follows:

Let y be the charge at the beginning of the 5 hours. Then, after 5 hours, the charge will be:
y - 5 * 9% = y - 45% = 49%

To find y, we can add 45% to both sides:

Janet's total hourly earnings are $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

The cost of 3 peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of 4 pears is 4 * $0.5 = $2
The cost of 2 kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums Jamaar can buy by dividing the remaining money by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of pieces she gave away. 

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

Since she gave the sweets to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18
Total number of portraits and selfies = 45

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests left is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:
76 + 30 = 106

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is:

"To find the total points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total to find the number of average and difficult questions. 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Half of 18 is 9, so she will get 9 average questions and 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, let's add up the total number of questions she is sure to get correct: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales, so we can set up the following equation:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

1. Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
2. Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
3. Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of not having a substitute teacher and getting an extension from the normal teacher: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of not having a substitute teacher, not getting an extension from the normal teacher, and getting a personal extension: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is: 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.76

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the new length and width.

Area of one piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set (x = 6), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required to cover the entire area.

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt).

Number of tiles = Total area / Area per tile
Number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To find the amount James pays per month, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

Normal cost: $120
60% of normal cost: 0.6 * $120 = $72
Total monthly cost: $120 + $72 = $192

Since James pays this amount per month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost.

Yearly cost: $192 * 12 = $2304

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch per weekend and then multiply it by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

They watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, the total number of movies they watch per weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weeks, and each week has one weekend, the total number of weekends is 4. 

The total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food eaten per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food eaten per day (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 / 360 = 2

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine the number of slices eaten by Jake and Silvia. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and 3 more slices than Jake, we can find Jake's slices by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 
Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. 
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.
Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, let's denote Donovan's time as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken for the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's time, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's time is 'x + 18', we can now find Betsy's time:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18
Betsy's time = 58

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

"To find the number of emails James responds to in a day, we first need to find the number of emails that don't require a response. 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.7 = 14
Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Total number of pizzas left = 6 (from the glee club) + 8 (from the football team) = 14

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of mailing the small and big coupons:
Total cost = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:
Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = 20 - 5 = 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons of fertiliser per truck to find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:
Total tons of fertiliser delivered = 15 * 20 = 300

"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we first need to calculate the total number of pounds Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for one pound at full price ($4.00) and the second pound at half price ($2.00). 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per set ($6.00) by the number of sets (3). 

$6.00 * 3 = $18.00

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests attending is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there is an additional charge of $6 for each guest above 20. Since there are 41 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126. Adding this to the base fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten per day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first and second monkey per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first and second monkey from the total bananas eaten per day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

- BMX bikes = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, and 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on each of Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each of Saturday and Sunday. The total extra learning time on weekends is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours per week.

The total time John spends learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends: 26.67 + 21 = 47.67 hours per week.

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the initial weight. Therefore, the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. 

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother and Ellen's friend has not taken any yet) and 6 are unshaken (since 9 - 1 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas were taken by Ellen and Ellen's brother).

The probability of selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining. So, the probability is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people Billy helps is 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people who arrived in cars and buses, and then add them together.

Number of people who arrived in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people
Number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Total number of people who arrived: 60 people + 420 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the people who arrived are the ones inside the church.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the time spent per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks per day is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Adding the lunch time, the total time spent per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent per day is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The discounted price of the frying pan is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
The discounted price of the towels is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Sheila's new purchases total:
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Adding the new purchases to her balance after returning the item:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to determine the number of large jellyfish that change color under UV light and then work our way backward.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and we are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * large jellyfish = 6

To find the number of large jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 3:

large jellyfish = 6 * 3
large jellyfish = 18

Now, we know that a fifth of the total jellyfish are large. We can set up the equation:

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 5:

total jellyfish = 18 * 5
total jellyfish = 90

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide an exact answer. But if we assume she just started working, then the number of years she needs to work is 40.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the given percentage and number of boys. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240
0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract her planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike: 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 
The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional time worked by the other four workers will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, we are told that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker and the other four workers produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 200 - 200 = 0 toys in the 10 hours that the first four workers worked. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

The first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours. The manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The first four workers produced 200 toys, so the fifth worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together the four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the number of logs John can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, John can make 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

Since x is the temperature of the second bottle, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the total cost will be $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, the total number of lemons he gets per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade, so the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the initial number of women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. To find the number of women, we can calculate the fraction of the total number of passengers that are women. 

Women's fraction = 9/14
Initial number of women = (9/14) * 84
Initial number of women = 9 * 6
Initial number of women = 54

Now, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women.

Number of women who remained = Initial number of women - Number of women who alighted
Number of women who remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who remained = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday operates for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold by adding the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in bouquets:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 to invest in the rock stand. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy:
100 / 5 = 20 rocks

If he sells 60% of his inventory, he will sell:
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 * 7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is:
20 * 5 = $100

Since Adam invested $100 and only made $84, he loses:
100 - 84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days required for each type of scene. However, this would assume she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done, then moves to the next. A more efficient approach would be to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total number of days.

One way to do this is to work on the scenes with the highest number of days required first. In this case, Lauren should work on the large-sized scenes for 9 days, then the small-sized scenes for 7 days, and finally the medium-sized scenes for 6 days. However, she can work on the medium-sized scenes while working on the small-sized scenes, as 6 days is less than 7 days.

So, the total number of days required would be the maximum of the days required for large-sized scenes and the sum of the days required for small-sized and medium-sized scenes, which is max(9, 7) = 9 days for large and small, and then 6 days for medium can be done in the last 6 days of the 9 days for large, and the 7 days for small, so the total is 9 + (7-6) = 10.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since it's three times more likely to win than the first ticket, which has a 20% chance of winning, we can calculate the probability of the second ticket winning as follows:

Probability of second ticket winning = 3 * Probability of first ticket winning

= 3 * 0.2
= 0.6
= 60%

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of first ticket winning * Probability of second ticket winning

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
- 3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
- 1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows:
- All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 babies
- 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

Now, we add the additional pods to the original number of pods:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The new box contains 120 pods and costs $12. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost:

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
Total goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. The amount of chalk left is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how much chalk is left that can be used. The amount of usable chalk left is 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches, but since the teacher can still use the 2 inches, we will use 2.75 inches for our calculation.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, so the amount of chalk used per day is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch. However, since we are working with the remaining chalk, we will use 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

Now, we can calculate the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk by dividing the amount of usable chalk left by the amount used per day: 2.75 / 0.55 = 5.

However, since the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, we should subtract 1 from the total number of days to account for the day that has already passed. Therefore, the teacher has 5 - 1 = 4 days left before he has to recycle the chalk, but since the chalk is already 2.75 inches, we should add 1 day to account for the day the chalk will be 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher has 4 + 1 = 5 days left before he has to recycle the chalk, but since the chalk will be 2 inches on the 5th day, we should subtract 1 day from the total number of days. Therefore, the teacher has 5 - 1 = 4 days left before he has to recycle the chalk.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then divide it by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes by dividing the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiplying by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we need to find out the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then subtract the amount he got to keep.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is the number of gallons multiplied by the cost per gallon:
4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount:
2/5 * $14,000 = (2 * $14,000) / 5
= $28,000 / 5
= $5,600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Colin is 20 years old now."
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can calculate the cost per book as follows:
Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
Total number of books = $27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can calculate the number of books per school as follows:
Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3 schools = 5400 books / 3 = 1800 books per school

"To find out how many apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. He threw this 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has the apples in his pocket (5) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11 apples.
4. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

So, Newton brought home the apples he had in his pocket (5 from the previous step + 1 from the very beginning) and the 6 apples that fell in the last step, for a total of 5 + 1 + 6 = 12 apples.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate his snowball-building rate per minute as follows:
20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Jay's snowballs melt at a rate of 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we can divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt:
2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

Now, we can calculate Jay's net snowball-building rate per minute by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate:
1/3 snowballs/minute - 2/15 snowballs/minute = (5/15 - 2/15) snowballs/minute = 3/15 snowballs/minute = 1/5 snowballs/minute

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can calculate the time it will take him to build that many by dividing the number of snowballs needed by his net snowball-building rate:
60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs/minute) = 60 * 5 minutes = 300 minutes

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 + 38 = 169 bandages. Then subtract the 50 bandages they ordered on the first day: 169 - 50 = 119.

The final answer is: 119"

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is:

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

Blood in a shark = 3 * Blood in a whale
Blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately. 

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 bottles = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we calculate 50% of the cost of scotch and add it to the cost of scotch:
50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30 = $90

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:
20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor. So, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling from the total height of the house. Since the height of the second floor's ceiling is not given, we assume it is the same as the first floor's ceiling, which is 180 inches (3 times Mattison's height).

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find the estimated number of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying the base area by the height:
Volume = base area * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is:
Effective volume = Volume * 0.8
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar:
Total jelly beans = Effective volume / volume of a single jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true and estimated values:
Difference = True red jelly beans - Estimated red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. 
So, the cost for the first 5 years is 5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $5.
For the next 3 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $5.
So, the cost for the next 3 years is 3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups:
40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Each group uses 45 minutes, so the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet.

We can write the equation as:
x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32.

"To determine how much of the secret seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, and there are five people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The initial price of the toy in November was $40. 
In December, the price increased by 80%, so we need to find 80% of $40 and add it to the initial price.
80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December = Initial price + Increase = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so we need to find 50% of the price in December and subtract it from the price in December.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone. 

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are 4 additional phones. The total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

First, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts in June.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 3600 * $2 = $7200.

"To find out how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we first need to determine the total number of batches she needs to upload. 

Since Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch, we divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos per batch (7). 

210 / 7 = 30 batches

Now, we know Jade uploads 6 batches each day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of batches (30) by the number of batches per day (6).

30 / 6 = 5 days

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people for each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people was 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the total number of people was 2 * 70 = 140.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, so the total number of people for these days was 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the number of people for each day:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 500"
"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To determine the number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total number of gallons of lemonade Tim will make. He initially planned to make 4 gallons, but his friend asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.

The total number of gallons is 4 (initial gallons) + 1 (extra gallon) = 5 gallons.

Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, we can consider it as 2 regular gallons in terms of lemon juice requirement. So, the total number of gallons in terms of lemon juice requirement is 4 (initial gallons) + 2 (extra gallon) = 6 gallons.

For 1 gallon of lemonade, 1 cup of fresh lemon juice is required, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, for 6 gallons of lemonade, the total number of lemons required is 6 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 36 lemons.

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. We know there are 4 blue blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12 blocks.

We are given that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 (total) - 12 (blue and yellow) = 20.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: The boat depreciated by 30% of its original value. 
30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: The boat depreciated by 30% of its value after the first year.
30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: The boat depreciated by 20% of its value after the second year.
20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the hotel stay is $80 per night for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel stay is:
$80 * 3 = $240

The cost of each bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is:
$80 * 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is:
$8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip:
$240 + $56 = $296

Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Now, let's add the cookies baked to the remaining cookies:
11 (remaining cookies) + 12 (cookies baked) = 23 cookies

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for each half of his collection and then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for this half is 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for this half is 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's average enrollment as follows:

Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * Norman High School's average enrollment
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

Difference in average enrollment = Norman High School's average enrollment - Butler High School's average enrollment
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow cookies = 2595
Total number of oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered. 

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which was 14. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes. Let's denote the number of beakers as B. 

8 (test tubes) + B (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29

Combine the constants: 
8 + 16 = 24
24 + B = 29

Now, solve for B: 
B = 29 - 24
B = 5

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which was 7, and he ended up with 5, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race. 

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can calculate the distance Aaron ran by dividing Vanessa's distance by 2. 

Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles

We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes for 2 miles, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Time per mile for Aaron = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is twice Aaron's time per mile.

Time per mile for Vanessa = 8 minutes per mile * 2 = 16 minutes per mile

Now, we can calculate the total time it took Vanessa to run her part of the race by multiplying her time per mile by the distance she ran.

Time for Vanessa = 16 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 200 feet * 3 = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total line required to find out how much more he needs to buy.

Line to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line to buy = 600 - 6
Line to buy = 594

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price of each watermelon and then apply the 25% profit.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we apply the 25% profit to the cost price.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first determine the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. 

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is 18 years old now. This means John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is 37 years old now, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the radiator cost and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find the number of cows:

w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

So each person can have 14 slices.
