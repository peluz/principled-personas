"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid by the ducks: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Total bolts required = blue fiber + white fiber
Total bolts required = 2 + 1
Total bolts required = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh was the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs.
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total amount of feed needed per day) - 40 (amount of feed given in the first two meals) = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep.
Total number of sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drove at 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance covered in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 3 hours at 60 mph before turning around. The distance he covered in those 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he covered in the 4 hours from the initial distance:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered in 4 hours = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

Since the total revenue is still less than the total cost at the end of year 5, we need to calculate for year 6. At the end of year 6, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108). However, if we calculate the revenue for the next year, we get:

Year 7: Total revenue = $63 + $10.50 = $73.50 (still less than the total cost)
Year 8: Total revenue = $73.50 + $10.50 = $84 (still less than the total cost)

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:

Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and the second day separately, then add them together.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are only asked for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances covered on both days.

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs each group of customers bought and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they bought 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs bought by each group of customers:
3 (first 3 customers) + 4 (next 2 customers) + 0 (last 3 customers) = 7

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to determine how many hours it burns and then multiply that by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours it burns by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

"To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). The amount he paid is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price.

We can set up the equation as follows:
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items we know she bought. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes would be $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, let's divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find out how many boxes she ordered: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then determine how many cartons she will need to buy.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she will need, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance traveled before the second stop and subtract the distance traveled before the first stop.

Henry's total trip was 60 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end. So, the distance traveled before the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Since Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, we subtract this distance from the distance traveled before the second stop to find the distance between the two stops: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can find the cost of the boots by adding $5 to the total cost of the heels.

Cost of boots = $99 + $5 = $104

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. Let's represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of all three friends and then find the average.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses of all three friends: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the daily hours spent and then multiply it by 7.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours spent per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours spent per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of gold and silver coins is equal to 110. 

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
Gold coins = x + 30
Gold coins = 40 + 30
Gold coins = 70

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of that is 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

We are also told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we can find the total points Mike scored by adding the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Total points = 4 + 5 = 9 points

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets left.

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week. 

He runs 3 days a week. The first day, he runs 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running and walking speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, if skipping speed is half of running speed, then her running speed is 2 times her skipping speed. 
Running speed = 2 * skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. 
So, her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed.
Walking speed = 1/4 * running speed
Walking speed = 1/4 * 6 miles per hour
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 
Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance covered while running = running speed * time spent running
Distance covered while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance covered while running = 12 miles

Distance covered while walking = walking speed * time spent walking
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance covered while walking = 6 miles

Total distance covered = distance covered while running + distance covered while walking
Total distance covered = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance covered = 18 miles

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that the 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is 80 + x - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we can add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Now, we can subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as:

Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units

The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 oranges is 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we have:
- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

Total number of oranges that are not good = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges

Total number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of oranges that are not good

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. The total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost before insurance, which is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

The total amount Janet paid is the sum of the cost before insurance and the insurance cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to determine the percentage of the full pension she is entitled to. 

Since she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, and she has worked for 30 years, she has worked 10 years beyond the 20-year mark. 

10 years * 5% per year = 50%

Since the full pension is $50,000 per year, we can calculate Marcy's annual pension as follows:

$50,000 * 0.5 = $25,000

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to find the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year, then add them together.

The first half of the year consists of 6 months. Since Aleena was charged $140 per month initially, the amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
6 months * $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less money. To find the new monthly charge, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
New monthly charge = $140 - $14 = $126

The second half of the year also consists of 6 months. The amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
6 months * $126/month = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first and second half of the year to find the total amount:
$840 + $756 = $1596

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon. We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

Total miles = mpg * Total gallons in tank
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles = 300 miles

"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, the total time spent per day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the time spent per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

In addition to the players, each school has 2 coaches (1 for each team). 

So, the total number of people sent by each school is 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools competing, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies:
2 * 140 = 280

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

The second level will have twice the square footage of the top level, which is 2 * 16 = 32.
The third level will have twice the square footage of the second level, which is 2 * 32 = 64.
The fourth level will have twice the square footage of the third level, which is 2 * 64 = 128.

Now, we can calculate the total square footage of all levels: 
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

The puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. 
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. 
There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to determine how much laundry each of them does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4. 
David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2.
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does.
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry = 200 - 100 = 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since 18 is divisible by 2, Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each. The total cost will be 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The total cost will be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

$600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660

Since she gets this 10% increase every year for the next three years, we need to calculate her monthly salary for each of those years:
Year 1: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726

"To find the number of pieces left, we need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom, then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

After Poppy places her pieces, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces placed (250 + 250) from the total number of pieces: 1000 - (250 + 250) = 1000 - 500 = 500.

"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we first need to determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie intake as follows:

Cody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by adding Amir's cookies to Cody's cookies:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5
Total cookies = 20

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies. So before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, Henry actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he meant to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation to find the number of cookies he baked last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first find the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The total cost of the gas is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased:
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback amount is the cashback per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased:
$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice. 

Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, so she ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. 

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by the number of people (2). 

Average = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed, we need to find the total time it took her to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds. 

We can set up a proportion to find the total distance rowed: 
(20 feet) / (16 seconds) = x feet / (64 seconds)
x = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. 
Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet
Total water taken on = 16 liters

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to first determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

We are given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x
300 = 50 * x

Now, we can solve for 'x':
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840/20
x = 42

Number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: 42"

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, 2 containers with 5 vehicles each were imported. So, the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

Number of containers imported on the second day: 4"
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary four years ago = Lylah's salary four years ago + 30% of Lylah's salary four years ago
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since we don't know the rate at which Lylah's salary increased, we will assume it increased simultaneously with Adrien's, but we don't have enough information to calculate the exact rate. However, we can infer that the problem intends for their salaries to increase at the same rate, which is 40% for Adrien. 

New Lylah's salary = Old Lylah's salary + (40% of old Lylah's salary)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New Lylah's salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. The total hours for these two days are 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. The total hours for these four days are 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamped 20 letters. To find out how many were in the pile initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters: 30 - 20 = 10.

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had initially, we need to add the 3 spoons she used back to the 7 spoons.

7 spoons + 3 spoons = 10 spoons

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and then calculate the costs and revenues.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by the doctors, we convert the time per patient to hours and multiply by the number of patients:

24 minutes/patient * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.4 hours/patient
0.4 hours/patient * 500 patients = 200 hours

The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by the doctors is 200 hours, so the total revenue is:

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest: 
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples per harvest.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece one, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive flew from the hive and left. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
So, the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees.
However, 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours. So, the number of bees that left and hadn't returned before the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. So, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost of the tickets to find out how much she gave the cashier. 

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. The time Steve will be waiting is the difference between Tim's time and Steve's time.

Time Steve will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

- 5 people with bicycles had 2 tires each inflated, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people with tricycles had 3 tires each inflated, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated.

Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Cost per tire is 25 cents, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to calculate the total number of cookies and multiply it by the cost per cookie. 

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

The cost per cookie is $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

We know that after the ants carried off a final french fry, there were 5 fries left. Before that, the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole 2/3x fries, and 1/3x fries remained. Since the ants carried off 1 fry and left 5, we can set up the equation: 1/3x - 1 = 5. 

Solving for x, we get: 
1/3x = 6
x = 18

So, before the raccoon stole some fries, there were 18 fries. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. Before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries. 

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries. 

Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes per month and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total bananas required per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the total bananas required per month by 2.

Total bananas required for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

"To determine the winner and the difference in distance, we need to calculate the total distance run by both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance for each round trip is 200 yards. So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for each round trip to the 40-yard line is 80 yards (40 yards to the line and 40 yards back). So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. The difference in distance is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's catch: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's catch: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months. 

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

After the first 2 months, the price will be $20 + $4 = $24.

However, for the next 2-month interval, the price increase will be 20% of the new price ($24), not the original price. 
20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80

The price after the second 2-month interval will be $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We can see a pattern emerging, where the price increase is 20% of the previous price. This is a classic example of compound interest.

To calculate the price after 18 intervals, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

where A is the final price, P is the original price ($20), r is the interest rate (20% or 0.20), and n is the number of intervals (18).

However, since the interest rate is applied every 2 months, we need to adjust the formula to:

A = P * (1 + r)^n
A = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ $20 * 7.485947397
A ≈ $149.71884794

Rounding to two decimal places, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months will be approximately $149.72.

Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9
Number of babysitting sessions = 5

"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of this event. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

Next, we need to find the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 or 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6). To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months first. 

The monthly interest is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 * $100 = $2. 

Since the interest is for 3 months, the total interest is $2 * 3 = $6.

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Mandy should pay: $100 + $6 = $106.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost price per bag is $20, and the selling price per bag is $30. There's also a transportation cost of $2 per bag.

The total cost price for 'x' bags is $20x, and the total transportation cost is $2x. The total selling price for 'x' bags is $30x.

The total profit is the selling price minus the cost price and the transportation cost: 
Profit = Selling Price - (Cost Price + Transportation Cost)
Profit = $30x - ($20x + $2x)
Profit = $30x - $22x
Profit = $8x

We know the total profit is $400. So we can set up the equation:
$8x = $400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by $8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Number of bags sold: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since the friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3. 
$102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, the total minutes he collects peaches is:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches he collects, multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:
180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate their total weekly requirement. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, a flock of ten ducks will need 10 * 3.5 = 35 pounds of insects per week.

Now, we need to divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find out the daily requirement. 

35 pounds per week / 7 days per week = 5 pounds per day.

"To find the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees each year and then account for the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since he starts with 50 trees and has a net gain of 8 trees per year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years (before any trees die) is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130:
0.3 * 130 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard.

So, on Saturday morning, there were:
- 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos
- 6 white flamingos

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are:
- 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos
- 6 white flamingos

At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:
30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount she prepared.

The total cost of the crayons is the number of crayons multiplied by the cost of one crayon. Violetta needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta prepared.

Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants and subtract that from the total amount of carrots available.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total amount of carrots to be distributed is:
40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to her initial collection.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add the cards she collected each month to her initial collection: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from both publishers. 

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and edits a total of 1000 sentences, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find the total liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the number of liters in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon, so the total number of pails he gets in a day is:
5 (morning) + 6 (afternoon) = 11 pails

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total liters of water he gets every day is:
11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate John's original annual salary:
Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Original annual salary: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Next, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary:
Raise amount: 5% of $104,000 = 0.05 * $104,000 = $5,200
New annual salary: $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for the entire year. Therefore, his total earnings for the year will be:
Total earnings: New annual salary + One-time monetary reward
Total earnings: $109,200 + $5,000 = $114,200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

He also used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which is a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will consider the best 5 scores out of 6.

The desired average is 93, and there are 6 tests, but we will consider 5 tests for the average. So, the total score needed for 5 tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score Brinley has so far: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score, which is 71. The new total score is:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score for the best 5 tests, including the 6th test. We already know the total score needed for the best 5 tests is 465. Since we have removed the lowest score, we will consider the new total score of 4 tests (367) and add the 6th test score to get the total score of the best 5 tests.

Let's denote the 6th test score as x. The total score of the best 5 tests will be 367 + x. We want this total score to be equal to the total score needed for the best 5 tests (465). However, we also need to consider that the lowest score of the 6 tests will be removed. If the 6th test score is higher than 89, then the 89 will be removed, and the total score will be 367 + x - 89 + 71 = 349 + x. If the 6th test score is lower than 89, then the 6th test score will be removed, and the total score will be 367 + x - x + 71 = 438.

Since we want the total score to be 465, we will consider the case where the 6th test score is higher than 89. So, the equation becomes:
349 + x = 465

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 465 - 349
x = 116

However, since the score cannot be higher than 100, we will consider the case where the 6th test score is lower than 89. In this case, the total score will be 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x - x + x = 438 + x -

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers. Since he did this for four weeks, the total distance covered in the first four weeks is 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers. Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance covered in the next three weeks is 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the distance covered in the first four weeks and the next three weeks to find the total distance: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 20 dozen cups, and 1 dozen is 12 cups, the total number of cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 cups = $145 per cup.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, the total amount of water leaked from each pool is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is 'x - 16'. The amount of water in the big pool now is '2x - 16'.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x', we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16
= 8

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has:

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:

- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total cards now = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing a week.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to determine the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * (2 * x), where x is the number of fish in each aquarium.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and multiply it by the hourly rate, then apply the discount.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for the entire movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake ingredients, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 
Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:
9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:
Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after the purchase.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially, since it's stated he puts the new cows into each of the twenty stalls). So, 40 cows are divided into 20 stalls, which is 40 / 20 = 2 cows per stall.

Now, each stall initially had 20 cows, and 2 more cows are added to each stall. So, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 feet and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal. 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, for a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of cups needed per cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies:

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies Carla is making by the amount of flour needed per cookie:

66 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 66 * 1/6 = 11 cups

So Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. It takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the time to cook the chicken is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.

The total weight of the flagstones is the weight of one flagstone multiplied by the number of flagstones: 
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck: 
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all flagstones are transported in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we first need to determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

First, convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Then, subtract the 30-minute break: 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, divide 150 minutes by 10 minutes: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Since Susan earns $5 per interval, multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round. 

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points (no change).
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year:
- Distance to work and back per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Total miles driven per week: 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
- Total miles driven per year: 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
- Total cost of driving per year: 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:
- Total bonus per year: $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of driving for John per year:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 and 32 (back and front)
- Page 2 and 31 (back and front)
- Page 3 and 30 (back and front)
- ...
- Page 16 and 17 (back and front)

This pattern continues until all 32 pages are paired. Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his total hours worked, his hourly earnings, and his bonus.

There are approximately 4 weeks in April. Since Watson works 5 days a week, he works a total of 4 * 5 = 20 days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, so his total hours worked in April is 20 * 10 = 200 hours.

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total hourly earnings for April is 200 * $10 = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. For 4 weeks, his total bonus is 4 * $300 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for April is the sum of his hourly earnings and his bonus: $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

3. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves of bread for the rest of the day.
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.
5. Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. 
8 pounds / 2 pounds per 4 weeks = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week (since 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to determine how many pencils each box can hold. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and a total of 26 pencils, we can subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total to find out how many pencils are in the boxes. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, we know that each box can hold 8 pencils. We also know that Jam and Meg have a total of 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

However, this is incorrect as the 60 would include non-programmers. We need to find the total number of programmers first. Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x. The number of non-programmers is 100 - x.

We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so we can set up the equation:
2/5 * 100 = 2/5 * x + (number of junior programmers that are not part of the total programmers)
However, this equation is not needed as we can simply use the proportion of junior programmers to the total number of employees to find the total number of programmers.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * x
40 = 2/5 * x
x = 40 * 5/2
x = 100

This means that all employees are programmers. This is highly unlikely, but we will continue with this assumption.

Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Monthly salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage of charge) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 2 hours

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received on this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they earn $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which gave them a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount they received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000/year

Job B:
- Gross income: $42,000/year
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before income tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Income tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

Difference in net income: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider RJ and Richard as the same person with 1 gun (since that's the number associated with RJ).

So, the total number of guns is: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard) + 5 (this is likely an error and we'll ignore the extra Richard) = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19 guns.

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people: 19 / 4 = 4.75.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price increase and decrease over the two years.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase).
New price = $8 * 1.5 = $12 per share.

The total value after the first year is 8 shares * $12 per share = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease).
New price = $12 * 0.75 = $9 per share.

The final value of all Maria's shares is 8 shares * $9 per share = $72.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x + 2x = 60
Combine like terms:
3x = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (20 cows * 4 legs) + (40 chickens * 2 legs)
Total legs = 80 + 80

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can assign the same weight to these three animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs:
- Yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs:
- Red bird: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the animals:
- Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:
- Total weight of the container and animals: 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

Since Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be twice the amount spent on gumballs:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each:
2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so:
44 * 1/4 = 11 seniors will receive cords
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:
11 * $12 = $132

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts:
$1056 (frames with etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to break down the information given.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we are left with 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who do not like blue. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 would be 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. We already know that 20 pupils do not like blue, and 5 of them like green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow would be 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is:
2 * 12 = 24 apples

Now, let's add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, it's (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% of the principal amount.

The interest paid is 4.17% of $3,650, which is 0.0417 * $3,650 = $152.355.

The total amount to be paid is the principal amount plus the interest: $3,650 + $152.355 = $3,802.355.

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5: $3,802.355 / 5 = $760.471.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. She sells 4 cups per hour, so the total number of hours is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it due to the bus breakdown. So, the number of girls who can perform is:

Number of girls who can perform = Total girls / 2
= 26 / 2
= 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total people who sang = Number of girls who can perform + Number of teachers

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio and then divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts. 

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, so the total parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, we divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 
165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. 
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To calculate the savings, we need to first determine the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling. 
The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The 20% discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's calculate the savings by cancelling the $60 cable package. 
The savings is the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services, which is $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and Jenny's portion.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since there are 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

In total, Bill and Mark have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is 7 (Bill and Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day and then the energy saved per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day.

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by 4.

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Total meat required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of meat per sandwich
Total meat required = 5 * 1
Total meat required = 5 pounds

Total cheese required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of cheese per sandwich
Total cheese required = 5 * 1
Total cheese required = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the total weight of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound.

Total cost of meat = Total meat required * Cost of meat per pound
Total cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total cheese required * Cost of cheese per pound

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns (80) to the number of corns he bought (60), resulting in a total of 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 cookies * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per recipe = 5 recipes.

Since each recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we can say that Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of two events: the candles that smell like wet dog and the candles that explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, and all exploding candles are considered more dangerous, we can assume that 5% of the 1% of candles that explode will smell like wet dog. 

The number of candles that explode is 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles. 

Now, 5% of these 500 candles will smell like wet dog, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = $14 * 4 
= $56

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

To find the number of apples gathered from the average trees, we subtract the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the combined total: 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this 350 apples is the total gathered by Joanne from the average trees and her sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees. Therefore, the 350 apples is the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
Size of Zack's locker = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Size of Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker
Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Size of Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. 

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000. 

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats took some away is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months. However, we only need 8 months of this rate, so:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, but we only need 10 months of this rate since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to get the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is the negative of that, but since the question asks ""how much more"" we are looking for the absolute difference in the other direction.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so the total capacity of buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibuses can hold 30 employees each, so the total capacity of minibuses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so the total capacity of minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity:
240 (buses) + 180 (minibuses) + 150 (minivans) = 570 employees.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade) + 60 (store-bought) = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150 in total.

We know that Kenny sold his cards for $1.5 each, so we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, we know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the following equation:

(2/3) * x = 100

where x is the total number of cards he started with.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

x = (3/2) * 100
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total original price is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the total original price:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature after baking and then after opening the window.

Initially, the house temperature is 40 degrees. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total increase in temperature due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature due to opening the window is 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.

- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We already know James' time for the swim and bike ride. To find James' time for the run, we subtract the sum of his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the popcorn with a soda costs an additional $1, making the total cost $21.

Now, let's consider the other option. The movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda must be $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the cost of the movie ticket and soda, so we can subtract these from the total cost to find the cost of the popcorn:

$19 (total cost) - $12 (movie ticket) - $3 (soda) = $4

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. In this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first find the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got during the week to the initial number of shoes:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so we subtract 180 from the total:

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to calculate the total pencils at the beginning, then subtract the pencils used after two months, and finally subtract the pencils used by the end of the year.

Initially, there were 30 students with 10 pencils each, so the total pencils at the beginning of the year were 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. 1/5 of 300 is (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils. So, the remaining pencils after two months were 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

By the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 2/3 of the remaining pencils were used. 2/3 of 240 is (2/3) * 240 = 160 pencils. So, the pencils left were 240 - 160 = 80 pencils.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

However, this is incorrect since the question states that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, not that Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years. Therefore, we need to subtract 4 years from Brett's age in four years to get his age that Angela will be three times of in four years.

Brett's age in four years = 14 + 4
Brett's age in four years = 18

Now subtract 4 years from this to get Brett's age that Angela will be three times of in four years.

Brett's age that Angela will be three times of in four years = 18 - 4
Brett's age that Angela will be three times of in four years = 14

However, we already know this. We need to subtract 4 years from Brett's age in four years to get his age that Angela will be three times of in four years. We already know that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, we need to subtract 4 years from Angela's age in four years to get her current age.

However, we can simply subtract 4 years from Angela's age in four years to get her current age. We already know that Angela's age in four years is 42. Therefore, we can simply subtract 4 years from 42 to get Angela's current age.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Paul drove his car for 14 days, so the number of morning rides and afternoon rides is 14 each.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.
The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to find the total amount spent: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation:
D = B/2

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation:
B + D + L = 43

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
B + B/2 + L = 43

Combine like terms:
(3/2)B + L = 43

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
(3/2)B + D + 7 = 43

Substitute the first equation into the above equation:
(3/2)B + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
(2B) + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:
D = B/2
D = 18/2
D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2:

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we'll use that. However, we need to check if Frederick can afford the 2 x 8 wood with his budget.

Frederick has $24. He can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and multiply it by the average punches per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total number of minutes is:
5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the average punches per minute:
15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.
   Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
   Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.
   Total money Ali has initially = $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister.
   Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80.

3. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after giving to his sister.
   Money Ali has after giving to his sister = $160 - $80 = $80.

4. Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner.
   Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

5. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.
   Money Ali has after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by 3 (since there are 3 grandchildren).

- A hat requires 2 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.
- A scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.
- A sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
- A pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.
- A pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool. For 3 grandchildren, 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Wednesday is 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual picking rates of each person.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can add up the individual picking rates to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we will divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Number of uses = 3 (cookies, granola, snack mix)
Cups of raisins for cookies = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for cookies / Cups of raisins per batch

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts.

The cost of Ada's initial weekly consumption is 2016 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $3024.

After adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Ada's new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts.

The cost of Ada's new weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time to paint half a house).

Now, if we have 5 people painting the house, we can divide the total time it takes one person to paint the whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first determine the number of chairs each person has. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna.

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. We can do this by dividing the cost of the headphone set ($44) by the cost of a CD ($4). 

$44 / $4 = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since he already bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is 11.

"To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. 
Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. 
So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. 
Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off get on the bus. 
So, 1/3 of 21 is 7, and 7 passengers get on the bus. 
The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Next, we are given that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as x.

In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Since Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Now, we can find Jame's cousin's current age by subtracting 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Finally, we can find the difference in their current ages by subtracting Jame's age from his cousin's age: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is half the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. April has 30 days. 

Let's assume the daily savings for the first half is 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings for the second half will be '2x'.

The first half of the month has 15 days (April 1-15), and the second half has 15 days as well (April 16-30).

The total savings for the first half will be 15x, and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

Since Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125, we can set up the equation 45x = 1125.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the comparison, as the question is asking for a comparison between hot and cold days, but the given information is for cold and warm days. Since we do not have information about hot water, we will assume the warm water time is the closest we have to hot water.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and warm water. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to determine how much coffee Octavia and Juan currently drink.

The daily recommended cups of coffee is not explicitly stated, but we know Octavia drinks half of it. Let's call the daily recommended cups of coffee 'x'. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups for Juan's doctor. So, x = 4. 

Now we can calculate how much coffee Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the three friends: 
Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends: 
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger (which is 12 - 4 = 8 years old), he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time she spent reading: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

This is the nephew's age in 7 years. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from x:

Nephew's current age = 17 - 7
Nephew's current age = 10

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide $70 by 7 to find out how much he can spend each day:

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since he spent $10 per day for 4 days, he spent a total of:

$10 * 4 = $40

He can buy wooden action figures with this money:

$40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left to spend ($70 - $40 = $30). He can buy plastic action figures with this money:

$30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures and 15 plastic action figures.

- First flower shop: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week
Total roses ordered per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of crayon muffins she can create. 

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be divided into equal small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon isn't provided. 

We do know that Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. To find the total number of muffin crayons, we'll divide the total number of small pieces by 8. 

Assuming each crayon can be divided into 8 small pieces (to make the calculation easier), Kate has 192 * 8 = 1536 small pieces. Now, we can divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to get the total number of muffin crayons: 1536 / 8 = 192 muffin crayons.

Since Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is 192 * $1.50 = $288.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450°F
Actual temperature: 468°F
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18°F

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we can apply this percentage to the desired temperature of 520°F.

Actual temperature = Desired temperature / (1 + Percentage off)
= 520 / (1 + 0.04)
= 520 / 1.04

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of 1 box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since he buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair is:

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her workout. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories she burns is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burns. 1600 / 200 = 8.

The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the following equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the amount of protein he gets per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per day. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can multiply the amount of protein per gram by the number of grams he eats per day:

0.03 grams of protein per gram * 200 grams per day = 6 grams of protein per day

Now, we can multiply the amount of protein per day by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle by multiplying x by 3:

Largest angle = 3x = 3 * 30 = 90

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them together.

Steve initially received 5 games with his console. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so in 3 years, he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games.

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games.

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has: 
Initial games: 5
Christmas games: 15
Games bought in the first year: 12
Games bought in the second year: 24
Games bought in the third year: 48

Total number of games = 5 + 15 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 104

"To find the additional time it would take to travel 2000 miles, we first need to determine the plane's speed. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this speed to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his production rate per hour, we divide 120 by 2:

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's production rate per hour:

(3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours):

Ruiz: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:

720 + 1080 = 1800

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, the total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
The total earnings in the first 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, the total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
The total earnings in the next 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

The total earnings from selling lemonade for 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations.

First, let's calculate the number of rotations per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month.

To find the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle of shampoo. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps as follows:

Total number of pumps = 2 pumps * 120 washings = 240 pumps

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= $24.00 / 240 pumps
= $0.10 per pump

To convert the cost per pump to cents, we multiply by 100:

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
= 10 cents

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount: 
30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
$60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. Joe will spend $42 on the outfit.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, subtract the cost of the outfit from his initial $50:
$50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. The funding for these months is 50% more than the initial funding per month. The initial funding per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 50% more than this is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost of the additional 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we first need to find the amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Weight of flour in one bag = Number of portions * Weight of each portion
Weight of flour in one bag = 8 * 2
Weight of flour in one bag = 16 kilograms

Now, we can find the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the weight of flour in one bag by 3.

Total weight of flour in three bags = Weight of flour in one bag * 3
Total weight of flour in three bags = 16 * 3
Total weight of flour in three bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to calculate her sales from green hats. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can calculate her sales from green hats as follows:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate the total sales in the second month as follows:

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Total sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales in the first and second months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900

First, let's calculate the amount she actually received. We know her bank account had $200 at the start of the week and now holds $420. The difference between these two amounts is the amount she received this week.

$420 (current balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220 (amount received)

Since her expected wage is $300, we can now calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the amount received from the expected wage.

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (amount received) = $80

"To determine the number of eggs Lori will need, we first need to find out the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to prepare. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of eggs Lori will need is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since eggs are usually sold in dozens, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens Lori will need is 24 / 12 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as:
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the total number of children is 5. The combined ages of the twins are 2T, and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can express this as 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation 2T + 3t = 44, we get 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins. Since T = t + 7, we can substitute t = 6 into the equation to get T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner and subtract the time he spends on his homework.

First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework: 
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time available before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. 

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. 

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:
Neil's savings = Rong's savings + (2/5 * Rong's savings)
Neil's savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings = 20 + 8
Neil's savings = 28 coins per month

Now, we need to calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = Rong's savings per month * 120
Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400

Neil's total savings = Neil's savings per month * 120
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
Neil's total savings = 3360

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
Total coins = 2400 + 3360
Total coins = 5760

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is $40.

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. We can set up the equation:

0.4x = 40

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 40 / 0.4
x = 100

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is:

0.6 * 100 = 60

Now, we know the total bill is $100, and John brought $125. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

125 - 100 = 25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of one orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- Bananas: 5 bananas * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 apples * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 oranges * $3 = $21

The total price of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add the number of squares of each color together:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. 

So, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we first need to calculate the total points collected by the students.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find Gary's truck capacity by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Then, we divide the total amount of money ($100) by the sum of the parts (5) to find the value of one part: $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we multiply the value of one part ($20) by 3: $20 * 3 = $60.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they still need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raised per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised. 

So, the total number of hours is 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%:

40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

Now, let's divide Erin's budget by the cost of each set: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets, which is 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

However, we need to check if she can afford more scoops. If she buys 2 sets (6 scoops), she will spend 2 * $3.00 = $6.00, which is her entire budget. She won't have enough money to buy another set or a single scoop.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first find the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools. 

The total number of blue spools is the sum of light blue and dark blue spools: 15 + 45 = 60.

The total number of spools is the sum of all spools: 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100: (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days: 
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. 
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages. 

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate it as follows:
Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate her age as follows:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total voters - Total votes received by candidates A and B

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube and makes 3 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube and makes 7 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube and makes 8 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is:
$4000 + $1000 = $5000

He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
30 cards * $50/card = $1500

The total revenue from selling the cards is the sum of the values of all the cards:
$5000 + $1500 = $6500

Daily savings per tomato = $0.5 - $0.4
Daily savings per tomato = $0.1

Total daily savings = Daily savings per tomato * Number of tomatoes sold per day
Total daily savings = $0.1 * 500
Total daily savings = $50

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students that can be accommodated in 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

However, we are not given any information about the total number of students changing. We are only asked how many more groups are needed to form. Since the number of students per group remains the same, we can simply subtract the initial number of groups from the required number of groups.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we should convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the difference in sales, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he has already made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn. This is $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount of money he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Remaining time = Total time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost of series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5. Let's calculate the number of older movies:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10. Let's calculate the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
Total cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add the total cost of all types of movies:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 't' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 't - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30t
Points from time for Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between Ava's total points and Emma's total points:
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30t - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30t)
Difference = -25

The difference between their two scores is -25."

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the days they ride twice as much.

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

On the days they ride twice as much (2 days), they ride twice the usual number of rides, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the days they ride twice as much:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Since there are two people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of rides by 2:
27 rides * 2 = 54 rides

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought would be 17 - x.

After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had a total of (3 + (17 - x)) orange fish and (4 + x) white fish.

According to the problem, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(3 + (17 - x)) = 2 * (4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 2x + x

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he drives per week and the amount of fuel he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of days he drives per week is 5. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance per day is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles.

The total distance driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the amount of fuel he uses per week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 twenties is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. 
Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters, and she spent all of them. 
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount spent from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount spent. 
Total amount spent = $120 + $35 = $155.

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 
The number of stuffed goats will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x. 
The number of other stuffed animals remains the same, which is 14.

We can set up the equation:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts
Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount of tea consumed:
Total tea at the beginning = Total tea consumed + Remaining tea
Total tea at the beginning = 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = Total tea at the beginning (quarts) / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 48 quarts / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 12 gallons

"To find out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he ordered 100 more, bringing the total to 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

However, Dale sold 150 candies before ordering the additional 100. So, the total number of candies he has now is 200, and he has already sold 150.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First set: 3 flowers with 5 petals each = 3 * 5 = 15 petals
Second set: 4 flowers with 6 petals each = 4 * 6 = 24 petals
Third set: 5 flowers with 4 petals each = 5 * 4 = 20 petals
Fourth set: 6 flowers with 7 petals each = 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals initially = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower from each set, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals initially:

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 

14 / 2 = 7

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person used. 

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
- Citrus zest: z
- Fragrance: z
- Salt: 2z
- Sugar: 2z
- Oil: 4z

Total amount = z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation: 
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
z = 1

Now that we know z, we can find the amount of oil:
Amount of oil = 4z = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sells. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away to his mother. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, the number of cars Joe has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"To find the number of cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:
Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the original cost of the book.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost based on weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original cost of the book is $32.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the original cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

   Time spent recording per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Time spent recording per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours/week writing songs. 
   Time spent writing songs per month = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month

For the mirrors, Angela has 6, but the initial installation only includes 4. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors installed. 
For the chandeliers, Angela has 2, but the initial installation only includes 1. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier installed.
For the pictures, Angela has 20, but the initial installation only includes 10. So, she needs 10 additional pictures installed.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the turtles will take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway.

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to find the total time it would take all of them to cross the highway. However, the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway is the same as the time it would take all four turtles to cross, as they are traveling at the same speed and crossing the same distance.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine the number of trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Now that we know the farmer can fill 30 trays, we can multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray ($2.5) to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
Total earnings = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

We know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of the total. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in addition to the previous 48 homes. So, the correct total for the third year is the 48 homes already built plus the 96 new homes, but the 96 is the amount to be added to the total, not the total for the year. The total for the three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

Total homes built over the next three years:

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Given that I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

Given that I am 2 years older than my sister, we can express this as:
A = S + 2

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can rewrite S as S = A - 2 and B as B = A + 3. 

Substituting B and S in the last equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
6A + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
6A = 78

Divide both sides by 6:
A = 13

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in a pack to find out the number of packs needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

54 / 8 = 6.75

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to consider the initial amount, the amount after the first increase, and the amount after the second increase.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add this increase to the amount after the first increase: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river at that point: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previously infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previously infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip per customer = $20
Total tips for Rafaela = Number of customers * Tip per customer
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20
Total tips for Rafaela = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips.

10% of Rafaela's total tips = 0.1 * $800
10% of Rafaela's total tips = $80
Total tips for Julieta = Total tips for Rafaela - 10% of Rafaela's total tips
Total tips for Julieta = $800 - $80
Total tips for Julieta = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we need to add their individual totals.

Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela = Total tips for Julieta + Total tips for Rafaela
Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela = $720 + $800

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year: 36 (Wendy) - 6 (Amber) = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she sold and then multiply that by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised is 80 slices * 50 cents/slice = 4000 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 4000 cents / 100 = 40 dollars.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40
Total number of coins = 110

2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for Fawn's books. First, we'll express A in terms of F from the third equation:
A = F - 12

Now, substitute A in the second equation to express S in terms of F:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now, substitute S and A in the first equation using the expressions we found:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the total number of cookies left by the number of jars. 

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

"To find the total number of petals for each type of flower, we need to multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower.

For the orchids: 5 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 25 petals
For the daisies: 4 flowers * 10 petals/flower = 40 petals

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids. 
Difference = Number of petals of daisies - Number of petals of orchids

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants: 
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's the amount she made from mowing his lawn once. If she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times, then she made 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala's lawn.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she made $6 from Joe's lawn, she made 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba's lawn.

Now, let's add up the total amount she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, we can subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns to find out how much she made from lemonade sales: $80 - $54 = $26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total monthly earnings from renting out his car. 

He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours his car is rented out per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total monthly earnings from renting out his car is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total monthly earnings to find his profit: $750 - $500 = $250.

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of 50 miles, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday. Today, she read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. 
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.
Difference = Denise's total pages read - Daniel's total pages read

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first. 

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will be eating with their two children, the total number of bowls used for dinner will be 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls were used for dinner, the leftover soup can fill 8 - 4 = 4 child's bowls.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 4 child's bowls of leftover soup, each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day to find out how much free time Harold has left:
24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (total hours spent on activities) = 5 hours.

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * 9
Joseph's initial number of books = 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books. To find the number of books he currently has, we subtract the number of books he lost from his initial number of books:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

Total cups used for chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15
Total cups used for chamomile and mint tea = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the total cups used for chamomile and mint tea are divided by 2 (for equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea) and then divided by 3 (for the number of rows).

(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation (2):
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation (3):
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so the friends had 4 * 2 = 8 water balloons. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total initial number of balloons was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To determine the number of new tables needed, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so the total number of hours in a month is 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. So, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

With a 40% discount, James saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, which means he got back $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 15 hours to minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

We know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, so we can calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we can multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last leg = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

The USA has 50 states. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate India's number of states as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India's number of states = 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 
Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. We can calculate Jerry's cherries by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total:
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Finally, we can calculate how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:
Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days and then multiply them by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total earnings: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100
Discount on the red car = 0.4 * $100
Discount on the red car = $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost of both cars = $100 + $60
Total cost of both cars = $160

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then subtract 5 years from each of their ages to find their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's call his dad's age at that time ""x"". Since Emil is half his dad's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = x/2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 48

So, Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24.

We are also told that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24. Let's call his brother's age at that time ""y"". Since Emil is twice his brother's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = 2y

To solve for y, we divide both sides by 2:

y = 12

So, Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, so we subtract 5 years from his dad's age and his brother's age to find their current ages:

Dad's current age: 48 - 5 = 43
Brother's current age: 12 - 5 = 7

The sum of their current ages is:

43 + 7 = 50

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught and then divide it by the amount in one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the amount in one serving:
21 / 3 = 7

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant (30 inches) to find out how many plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, so Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / 1 pound/rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

Walter's friend gives him $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 
Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. To do this, we'll divide the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before this 3-hour period:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.79
Charge before 3 hours = 35.44%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up another equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.44% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.44% / 0.59
Initial charge = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly earnings are $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

The cost of 3 peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of 4 pears is 4 * $0.5 = $2
The cost of 2 kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums Jamaar can buy by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

Since she gave the sweets to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests remaining is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains the same.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:

"To find the total points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total to find the remaining questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions. 

Divide the remaining questions by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions correct and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, let's add up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The number of green balloons remained the same, 7.

When Sally released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, Sally had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 
- Substitute teacher comes in: 50%
- Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 20%
- Normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension, and Marcus gets a personal extension: 6%
Total probability of not having to turn in homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract the total probability of not having to turn in homework from 100%:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert it to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

At the second stop, 50 people descended, leaving:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people became:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required to cover the entire area. 

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

Now, we can calculate the number of tiles required by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt). 

Number of tiles = Total area / Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Number of tiles = 200

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads he does per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads of twin sheets (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). He can do 1 load of king size sheets.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food eaten per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food eaten per day (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Donovan's time as 'D' and Betsy's time as 'B'. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so B = D + 18.

We also know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's time. So, D + B = 98.

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98. Combining like terms, we get 2D + 18 = 98.

Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get D = 40.

Now that we know Donovan's time, we can find Betsy's time by adding 18 to Donovan's time. B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of mailing the small and big coupons:
Total cost = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we can calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = Number of trucks dispatched - Number of trucks that failed

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, and 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on each of Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each of Saturday and Sunday. The total extra learning time on weekends is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours.

The total time John spends learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends: 26.67 + 21 = 47.67 hours.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 bags * $5/bag
= $1000

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the initial weight. Therefore, the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas in total.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda).

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas, which is 2/8 or 1/4.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days = 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks. So, the total time for breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunches and breaks. 

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making the new purchases.

She initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning the $15.00 item, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The discounted price of the frying pan is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
The discounted price of the towels is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Sheila's new purchases total:
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Adding the new purchases to her balance after the return:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light, and these are a third of the large jellyfish. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3.

6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish

We also know that the large jellyfish are a fifth of the total number of jellyfish in the tank. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5.

18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide an exact answer. But if we assume she just started working, then the number of years she needs to work is 40.

Then, we divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the given percentage and number of boys. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240
0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and compare it to the required daily miles.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since she has 30 days in June to complete her 9,300 miles, we need to calculate the required daily miles: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract the planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find the additional miles per day: 310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles.

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

The total amount given away is 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since the question asks about James, but the initial buyers were Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, we can assume James is one of them. However, without knowing which one, we can only calculate the total amount left. 

The total amount left is 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5."

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 
The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional time worked by the other four workers will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, we are told that the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker and the other four workers produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 200 - 200 = 0 toys in the 10 hours that the first four workers worked. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours. The manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 more after the 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced by all workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The fifth worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together all four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:

1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes

The total time for the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

Total time = 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk)
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to subtract 2 dozen (24) from 60, since he will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more. 

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

Since x is the temperature of the second bottle, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes 3 potatoes make. 
1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can set up a proportion.

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply.

3 * 18 = 2x
54 = 2x
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he collects per year and then multiply it by the number of years in a decade.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree per year, the total number of lemons he collects per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree/year = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade. So, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

(9/14) * 84 = 54

So, there were 54 women initially on the bus. 

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday operates for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100, and he invests all of it in buying rocks at $5 each. The number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:
20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days required for each type of scene. However, this would assume she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's finished. A more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days required for each type of scene or to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days.

However, in this case, we can simply add the days required for each type of scene, as Lauren can work on the scenes in any order she wants.

9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

However, this is not the most efficient way to solve the problem. A more efficient way is to find the total number of days by considering the total work required.

Total work required = (45 large scenes / 5 scenes per day) + (36 medium scenes / 6 scenes per day) + (49 small scenes / 7 scenes per day)
Total work required = 9 + 6 + 7 = 22

However, we can also calculate the total work required in terms of a common unit, such as the total number of ""scene-days"" required.

Total scene-days required = 45 large scenes * (1 day / 5 scenes) + 36 medium scenes * (1 day / 6 scenes) + 49 small scenes * (1 day / 7 scenes)
Total scene-days required = 9 + 6 + 7 = 22

However, the most efficient way to solve this problem is to find the total number of days by considering the greatest number of days required for any one type of scene and then checking if the other scenes can be completed in that time.

9 days for large scenes is the greatest number of days required for any one type of scene. In 9 days, Lauren can complete the large scenes and also complete some of the medium and small scenes.

In 9 days, Lauren can complete 9 * 6 = 54 medium scenes, but she only needs 36. She can complete the remaining medium scenes in 3 days, but she has 9 days, so she can complete the medium scenes in the same 9 days.

In 9 days, Lauren can complete 9 * 7 = 63 small scenes, but she only needs 49. She can complete the small scenes in the same 9 days.

However, this is still not the most efficient way to solve the problem. The most efficient way is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days required for each type of scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is not 22, but rather the LCM of 9 and 7 is 63 and the LCM of 63 and 6 is 126, but the LCM of 9 and 6 is 18 and the LCM of 18 and 7 is 126, but the LCM of 6 and 7 is 42 and the LCM of 42 and 9 is 126.

However, the LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is not the answer, because the LCM is the least common multiple of the days required for each type of scene, but it is not the least common multiple of the days required for all the scenes.

The least common multiple of the days required for all the scenes is the least common multiple of the total number of days required for each type of scene.

The total number of days required for large scenes is 9, the total number of days required for medium scenes is 6, and the total number of days required for small scenes is 7.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126, but the LCM of 9 and 6 is 18 and the LCM of 18 and 7 is 126.

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first determine the total number of seashells collected. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends, then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, so he eats 5 x 4 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Mason eats 5 carrots each day on weekends, so he eats 2 x 5 = 10 carrots on weekends.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"To calculate Linus' profit, we need to determine the cost and selling price of the devices. 

The cost price of each device is $20. He sells each device for twice the original price, so the selling price is 2 * $20 = $40 per device.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. 

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120. 

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit earned is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, the additional number of bottles they need to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
- 3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
- 1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows:
- All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 babies
- 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

The total amount of money Abraham earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, the total payment per week is 1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $.40/collection = 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

- Year 6: 3 times the initial amount = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = production of an 8-year-old tree, and we know that x = 1000. 
So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope length = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the total number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the additional pods as follows:
20% of 100 pods = 0.2 * 100 = 20 pods

Now, we add the additional pods to the original number of pods:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The new box contains 120 pods and costs $12. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost:
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is worth $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he has is $1000 / $20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Since each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400. He then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill: $1200 / $5 = 240.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. The amount of chalk left is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how much chalk is left that can be used. The amount of usable chalk left is 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches, but since the teacher can still use the 2 inches, we will use 2.75 inches for our calculation.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, so the amount of chalk used per day is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch. However, since we are working with the remaining chalk, we will use 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

Now, we can calculate the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk by dividing the amount of usable chalk left by the amount of chalk used per day: 2.75 / 0.55 = 5.

However, since the teacher already used the chalk on Monday, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of days to get the correct answer.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate his snowball-building rate per minute as follows:
20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the melting rate per minute is:
2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

The net rate at which Jay's snowball collection grows is the difference between the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt:
Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15) snowballs per minute
To find a common denominator, we can multiply the first term by 5/5:
Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) snowballs per minute
Net rate = 3/15 snowballs per minute
Net rate = 1/5 snowballs per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs:
Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
Time = 60 * 5 minutes
Time = 300 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:
Time = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Time = 5 hours

However, this is the time it would take if Jay starts from 0 snowballs. Since Jay builds snowballs continuously, we can calculate the time it takes to build the first 60 snowballs by considering the time it takes to build 20 snowballs (1 hour) and then the remaining time to build 40 more snowballs at the net rate.

Time to build the first 20 snowballs = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Remaining snowballs to build = 60 - 20 = 40 snowballs
Time to build the remaining 40 snowballs = 40 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
Time to build the remaining 40 snowballs = 40 * 5 minutes
Time to build the remaining 40 snowballs = 200 minutes

Total time = Time to build the first 20 snowballs + Time to build the remaining 40 snowballs
Total time = 60 minutes + 200 minutes
Total time = 260 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:
Total time = 260 minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Total time = 4.33 hours

However, we can also convert the total time to hours and minutes:
Total time = 4 hours and 20 minutes

However, the question asks for the answer in numerical format only.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age at that time.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 (used on the second day) + 38 (used on the first day) - 50 (ordered on the first day) = 119 bandages.

Therefore, they started with 119 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost is $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate. We also need to add the additional $10 she receives for each week of complete attendance.

Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours
Total earnings from hours worked = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270
Total additional earnings from complete attendance = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40
Total earnings for April = $270 + $40 = $310

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * Amount of blood in a whale
Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Amount of blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * Amount of blood in a shark
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It is given that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens.

Since each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, the number of packs of black pens is 50 black pens / 5 pens/pack = 10 packs.

Now, we can find the total number of pens by adding the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of each bottle of scotch and the cost of each bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of each bottle of scotch, which is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on each day:
Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there were 4 people in total. 

To find out how much root beer was available for each person, we divide the remaining amount of root beer (8 gallons) by the total number of people (4).

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she initially had and subtract the colors she lost and used.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which is 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors. So, the total number of colors she initially had is 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy lost 4 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used from the total number of colors she initially had: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, this 240 inches includes the height of the second floor's ceiling. Since the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling. The problem doesn't explicitly state the height of the second floor's ceiling, but we can assume it's the same as the first floor's ceiling, which is 180 inches. However, this would be incorrect as the second floor's ceiling is also the first floor of the second story, and the first story's floor to ceiling height is the same as the second story's floor to ceiling height. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share is 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, the remaining shells after team Alphas and team The finders found their share is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

"To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debt, we need to calculate the amount of the loan and the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the value of his house:
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.4 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
Amount used to pay debt = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay debt = 0.6 * $100,000
Amount used to pay debt = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay debt from the loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120
Capacity of John's class = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15
Total capacity of John's school = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school:

Amount left = 20 * 1/4 = 20 * 0.25 = 5

Now, we can find out how many pomelos Eve gave away by subtracting the amount left from the original amount.

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left
Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he was left with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he was left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. 

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day. So, in one day, he travels 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km.

In 3 days, he travels 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered (3600 km). 

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and the number of grapes used by their mother.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so it's 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms and then the time spent per day.

The total time spent cleaning all classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes.

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, the time spent per day is 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day.

Now, we need to convert the 8-hour workday into minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes per day.

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the time spent cleaning per day by the total workday in minutes and multiply by 100: (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books a single bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs * $2.40 per dozen = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of:
5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the price per egg is:
$1 / 3 eggs = $0.33 per egg
Total revenue = 60 eggs * $0.33 per egg = $20

Now, let's calculate Rose's profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost per stick to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents): $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110, which is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

On the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly: 77 - 42 = 35.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of flashlights for people: 4
Number of flashlights for rooms: 8 * 2 = 16
Total number of flashlights: 4 + 16 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is 8 / 2 = 4.

Number of small candles: 4 * 4 = 16

1% of 1600 pounds = (1/100) * 1600 = 16 pounds

Force needed to push the car: 16 pounds"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the dimensions of James' fence, we can plug in the values: 
Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to cover the entire fence.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to find Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total number of hot dogs needed:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to calculate how many packs John needs to buy:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs

Finally, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to determine the total amount John needs to spend:

6 packs * $2 per pack = $12

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find the number of pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we subtract 2"" from Anne's height to get Jackie's current height:
Jackie's current height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can calculate the distance Aaron ran by dividing Vanessa's distance by 2. 

Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles

We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it would take Vanessa to run the same distance by multiplying Aaron's time by 2.

Time for Vanessa to run 2 miles = 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes

However, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa's time is directly proportional to the distance, we can multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2.

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first determine the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate Dora's current age. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find the number of cows:

w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to determine the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends). There are 4 people in total.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

56 / 4 = 14"
