"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. 

First, let's find out how many eggs she uses for herself and her friends. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs her ducks lay. 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg. 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we can add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh was the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs.
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total amount of feed needed per day) - 40 (amount of feed given in the first two meals) = 20

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep.
Total number of sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance he covered in the first 2 hours of standstill traffic: 0 miles (since he didn't move).

Next, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time (converted to hours): 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 15 miles

Then, he drove for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours 
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance he covered in the 4 hours is the sum of the distances: 
Total Distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles 
Total Distance = 135 miles

However, we need to consider the initial 3 hours of driving at 60 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours 
Distance = 180 miles

Since he turned around, the distance he covered in the first 3 hours is subtracted from the distance he covered in the next 4 hours. 
Distance from home = Distance covered in the first 3 hours - Distance covered in the next 4 hours 
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles 
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

Since the total revenue is still less than the total cost at the end of year 5, we need to calculate for year 6. At the end of year 6, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108). However, if we calculate the revenue for the next year, we get:

Year 7: Total revenue = $63 + $10.50 = $73.50 (still less than the total cost)
Year 8: Total revenue = $73.50 + $10.50 = $84 (still less than the total cost)
Year 9: Total revenue = $84 + $10.50 = $94.50 (still less than the total cost)
Year 10: Total revenue = $94.50 + $10.50 = $105 (still less than the total cost)
Year 11: Total revenue = $105 + $10.50 = $115.50 (greater than the total cost)

However, we can see that the total revenue is greater than the total cost at the end of year 11, but we can also see that the total revenue is greater than the total cost at the end of year 11, but

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the remaining vacuum cleaners after all the sales would be x - (x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1), which simplifies to x - (2x/3) - 1 or x/3 - 1.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation x/3 - 1 = 5. 
Solving for x, we get x/3 = 6, and x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance: 
20% * 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance enrollment: 
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 
25% * 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance (the rest of the students): 
20 - 4 (contemporary) - 4 (jazz) = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains traveled 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are only asked for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances traveled on each day.

Total distance covered by each train = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered by each train = 230 miles

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:
Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at the time of his son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs each group of customers bought and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they bought 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs bought by each group of customers:
3 (first 3 customers) + 4 (next 2 customers) + 0 (last 3 customers) = 7

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to determine the total number of hours it burns and then multiply that by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:
4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

"To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). The amount he paid is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price.

We can set up the equation as follows:
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items we know she bought. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items we know is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream per night, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she will buy is 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount she will spend on ice cream is 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance traveled before the second stop and subtract the distance traveled before the first stop.

Henry's total trip was 60 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end. So, the distance traveled before the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Since Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, we subtract this distance from the distance traveled before the second stop to find the distance between the two stops: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can find the cost of the boots by adding $5 to the total cost of the heels.

Cost of boots = $99 + $5 = $104

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. Let's represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of all three friends and then find the average.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses of all three friends: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the daily hours spent and then multiply it by 7.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours spent per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours spent per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of gold and silver coins is equal to 110. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since 'x' represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30', which is 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of his jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we can find the total points Mike scored by adding the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Total points = 4 + 5 = 9

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then determine the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 60 yogurts, we need to divide 60 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 60 / 4 = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost is 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his lego sets and then determine how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can calculate the total amount of money he spent, including the $5, which is $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money he spent from the total amount of money he made: $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is worth $15, we can divide the remaining amount of money by the price of a lego set to find out how many lego sets he still has: $30 / $15 = 2.

However, this is the number of lego sets he could buy back with the remaining money, not the number of lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his lego sets initially, he doesn't have any lego sets left.

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week. 

He runs 3 days a week. The first day, he runs 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running and walking speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, if she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame range.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the safe distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

- 1 bad orange
- 5 unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

Total number of oranges that are not good = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges

Total number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of oranges that are not good
= 25 - 8
= 17

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. The total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost before insurance, which is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

The total amount Janet paid is the sum of the cost before insurance and the insurance cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to determine the percentage of the full pension she is entitled to. 

Since she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, and she has worked for 30 years, she has worked 10 years beyond the 20-year mark. 

10 years * 5% per year = 50%

Since the full pension is $50,000 per year, we can calculate Marcy's annual pension as follows:

$50,000 * 0.5 = $25,000

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to find the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year, then add them together.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
Total amount for the first half of the year = $140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid 10% less than the initial amount. 
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.
Amount paid per month for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126.
Total amount for the second half of the year = $126 * 6 = $756.

Total amount paid for the streaming service by the end of the year = $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, we know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank. We can calculate her car's mpg as follows:

mpg = miles / gallons
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank:

Total miles = mpg * total gallons
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles = 300 miles

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

The puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. 
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. 
There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to determine how much laundry each of them does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4. 
David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2.
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does.
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the better price is the package of 2 flowers for $1.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since 18 is divisible by 2, Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each. The total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he would need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The total cost would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Henry has 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

Since he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, he actually meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

The number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

"To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The total cost of the gas is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased:
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback amount is the cashback per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased:
$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice. 

Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, so she ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. 
Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by the number of people (2). 
Average = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed, we need to find the total time it took her to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds. 

We can set up a proportion to find the total distance rowed: 
(16 seconds / 20 feet) = (64 seconds / x feet)
Cross-multiplying, we get:
16x = 64 * 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. 
We can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals:
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters:
8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to first determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

We are given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x
300 = 50 * x

Now, we can solve for 'x':
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840/20
x = 42

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, 2 containers with 5 vehicles each were imported. So, the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase (40%) for her as well.

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the weekly usage by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. The total hours for these two days are 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. The total hours for these four days are 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons Julia had, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had before her husband bought the spoons.

7 (spoons Julia had) + 3 (spoons used) = 10 spoons

Therefore, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and then calculate the costs and revenues.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by the doctors, we convert the time per patient to hours and multiply by the number of patients:

24 minutes/patient * 500 patients = 12,000 minutes
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by the doctors is 200 hours. Therefore, the total revenue is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations we derived earlier, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees. Since W = 4Q, W = 4(100) = 400.

Then, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive flew from the hive and left. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find the total number of bees that left the hive but hadn't returned yet. Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees hadn't returned. Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that left but hadn't returned is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all these 75 bees returned to the hive.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. So, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost of the tickets to find out how much she gave the cashier. 

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

"To find the number of Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach their homes.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their homes.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve reaches his home first, he will be waiting for Tim to finish the race. The waiting time is the difference between their times.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

- 5 people with bicycles had 2 tires each inflated, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people with tricycles had 3 tires each inflated, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated.

Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Cost per tire is 25 cents, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to calculate the total number of cookies and multiply it by the cost per cookie. 

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

The cost per cookie is $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

"To find the initial number of french fries, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. Before that, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole 2/3x, and 1/3x remained. Since the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5, we can set up the equation:

1/3x - 1 = 5
1/3x = 6
x = 18

So, before the raccoon stole some fries, there were 18 fries. 

Before the raccoon, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Let's call the number of fries before the pigeons ate 'y'. Then, the pigeons ate 9, and 18 remained. We can set up the equation:

y - 9 = 18
y = 27

So, before the pigeons ate, there were 27 fries.

Before the pigeons, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Let's call the number of fries before the seagull ate 'z'. Then, the seagull ate 7, and 27 remained (including the 9 eaten by the pigeons, the 2/3x eaten by the raccoon, the 1 eaten by the ants, and the 5 left behind). We can set up the equation:

z - 7 = 27 + 9 + 1 + 5 (the 5 left behind and the 1 eaten by the ants and the 9 eaten by the pigeons and the 2/3x eaten by the raccoon which is 12)
z - 7 = 53
z = 60

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 60."
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. Converting to feet: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes per month and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total bananas required per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) 
Total bananas required per month = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total bananas required per month by 2.

Total bananas required for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months
Total bananas required for 2 months = 1400 bananas

"To determine the winner and the difference in distance, we need to calculate the total distance run by both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance for each round trip is 200 yards. So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for each round trip to the 40-yard line is 80 yards (40 yards to the line and 40 yards back). So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. The difference in distance is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each person:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months.

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the price increase every 2 months is $4.

Since there are 18 intervals, we can calculate the total price increase as follows:
$4 * 18 = $72

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the price after 36 months, as the price increase is 20% of the original price every 2 months, not a fixed amount.

To calculate the correct price, we need to calculate the price increase for each interval and add it to the previous price.

Let's calculate the price for each interval:
- After 2 months: $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24
- After 4 months: $24 + (20% of $24) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
- After 6 months: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
- After 8 months: $34.56 + (20% of $34.56) = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
- After 10 months: $41.47 + (20% of $41.47) = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
- After 12 months: $49.76 + (20% of $49.76) = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
- After 14 months: $59.71 + (20% of $59.71) = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
- After 16 months: $71.65 + (20% of $71.65) = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
- After 18 months: $85.98 + (20% of $85.98) = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
- After 20 months: $103.18 + (20% of $103.18) = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
- After 22 months: $123.82 + (20% of $123.82) = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
- After 24 months: $148.58 + (20% of $148.58) = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
- After 26 months: $178.30 + (20% of $178.30) = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
- After 28 months: $213.96 + (20% of $213.96) = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
- After 30 months: $256.75 + (20% of $256.75) = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
- After 32 months: $308.10 + (20% of $308.10) = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
- After 34 months: $369.72 + (20% of $369.72) = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66

Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to determine how many apples Jenna picked and add that to the number of apples her mom picked. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20) to get the total number of apples they both picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The monthly interest is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 * $100 = $2. 

Since the interest is for 3 months, the total interest is $2 * 3 = $6.

Adding the interest to the principal amount, the total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6 = $106.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost price per bag is $20, and the selling price per bag is $30. There's also a transportation cost of $2 per bag.

The total cost price for 'x' bags is $20x, and the total transportation cost is $2x. The total selling price for 'x' bags is $30x.

The total profit is the selling price minus the cost price and transportation cost: 
Profit = Selling Price - (Cost Price + Transportation Cost)
Profit = $30x - ($20x + $2x)
Profit = $30x - $22x
Profit = $8x

We know the total profit is $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$8x = $400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by $8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Number of bags sold: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since the friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3. 
$102 / 3 = $34.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches he collects, multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:
180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees each year and then account for the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since he starts with 50 trees and has a net gain of 8 trees per year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years before any die is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130:
0.3 * 130 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard.

So, on Saturday morning, there were:
- 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos
- 6 white flamingos

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are:
- 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos
- 6 white flamingos

At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:
30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount she prepared.

The total cost of the crayons is the number of crayons multiplied by the cost of one crayon. Violetta needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add the cards she collected each month to her initial collection:

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. 
Total slices of cheese used for lunch = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
Total slices of cheese used for breakfast = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Total slices of cheese used = slices used for lunch + slices used for breakfast + slices used for dinner
Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is:
6 (bags) * 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

Janet also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is:
2 (bags) * 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will consider the best 5 scores out of 6.

The desired average is 93, and there are 6 tests, but we will consider 5 tests for the average. So, the total score needed for 5 tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score Brinley has so far: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score, which is 71. The new total score is:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score for the best 5 tests, including the 6th test. We already know the total score needed for the best 5 tests is 465. Since we have removed the lowest score, we will consider the new total score of 4 tests (367) and add the 6th test score to get the total score of the best 5 tests.

Let's denote the 6th test score as x. The total score of the best 5 tests will be 367 + x. We want this total score to be equal to the total score needed for the best 5 tests (465). However, we also need to consider that the lowest score of the 6 tests will be removed. If the 6th test score is higher than 89, then the total score will be 367 + x, and the lowest score will be 89. If the 6th test score is lower than 89, then the total score will be 367 + x, but the lowest score will be the 6th test score.

Since we want the average to be 93, we will assume the 6th test score is higher than 89. So, the total score of the best 5 tests will be 367 + x.

Now, we set up the equation:
367 + x = 465

Subtract 367 from both sides:
x = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers. Since he did this for four weeks, the total distance covered in the first four weeks is 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers. Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance covered in the next three weeks is 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the distance covered in the first four weeks and the next three weeks to find the total distance: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16. 

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 24

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for each leg of the trip and add them together.

The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The trip from Rochester to New Jersey by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Now, we add the number of days for each leg of the trip: 
6 days (bus trip) + 3 days (car trip) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total cards now = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333

To convert this probability to a percentage, multiply by 100:
Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
Adding extra meat costs $2.00, extra cheese costs $1.00, and avocado costs $1.00, so the total for these extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00.
Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so the total for the sauces is $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.
The total cost of the meal without the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.
The meal upgrade costs $3.00, so the total cost of the meal is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to first determine how many pieces they can place per minute together. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of watermelons that were ready and subtract them from the total.

Initially, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, so the remaining number of watermelons is:
120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To find the total cost of the cars, we first need to calculate the total cost before tax and registration. 

The cost of 12 cars at $20,000 each is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. 
10% of $240,000 is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars. 
$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Finally, we add the registration cost for 12 cars at $1000 each. 
12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Adding the registration cost to the total cost, we get:
$264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday (25) by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to determine the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants. 

Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2. 

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, we can find the total number of insects by adding the number of bugs and ants.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins jumped in the ocean and how many went inside the cave, then subtract that total from the initial number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins
Another one-third went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Now, subtract the total penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his total weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine per week:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we first need to find out the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices required is 20 * 4 = 80.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. So, 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he creates by mixing the ink.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low in these pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from the 25 initial pens, he can create 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, Ram has the initial 25 pens and the 5 new pens he created. However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually. When they do, he can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is the initial 25 pens, the 5 new pens he created from the initial pens, and the 1 additional pen he created from the 5 new pens.

Total pens = 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from initial pens) + 1 (pen from new pens) = 31

"To find the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to calculate the initial investment and then multiply it by 3.

Johnny started with his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so his initial investment was $20 + $10 = $30.

Since his investment tripled in a year, we multiply the initial investment by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 
Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

The remaining students are:
1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, which is:
3/5 * 700 = 420 students

Now, the number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after exits A and B:

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we first need to determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find Robert's total.

Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's total to find James' total.

James' candies = 27 + 6 = 33

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' total from John's total.

Difference = 54 - 33 = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly limit.

First, let's calculate the minutes he used for his daily calls with his boss. Since this month has 30 days, he has had 30 calls with his boss, each lasting 15 minutes. 

30 days * 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes he has used is:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes he has used from his monthly limit:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin was left with:
19 - 10 = 9

Then, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had:
9 + x

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with:
9 + x - 2

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
9 + x - 2 = 27

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 27 - 9 + 2
x = 20

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to determine the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * (2 * x), where x is the number of fish in each aquarium.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories each of them consumed are:
Sue's sister: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories

The difference in calories consumed is: 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 (initial) + 2 (added) = 22 cows.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, for a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the number of cups needed per cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies:

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies Carla is making by the amount of flour needed per cookie:

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 
So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know that half of the balls are golf balls. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls, half of them would be 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.

Next, we are told that half of the golf balls are blue. So, half of the 8 golf balls would be 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house, then multiply by the number of houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 * 2 = 6.

In addition to the bedroom windows, each house has 4 more windows. So, the total number of windows per house is 6 (bedroom windows) + 4 (additional windows) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves.

Stitches for body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Total stitches for the sleeves: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the stitches for each sleeve.

Stitches for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the song, then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we can add the number of lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Time to dig 30 small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time to dig 15 large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to understand that their current combined age is 20. 

In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will have aged by 10 years each. So, we need to add 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco to their current combined age.

Current combined age: 20
Additional years for Mico: 10
Additional years for Marco: 10
Total additional years: 10 + 10 = 20

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

"To determine the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, let's add the team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 39 is exactly divisible by 3 when considering the remainder as 0, so we don't need to round up. We need 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of sterling silver beads by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

So, the total amount of money Kelly has initially is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. 
To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has initially: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row of 5-star has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 

First, convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. 

Then, subtract the 30-minute break: 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, divide 150 minutes by 10 minutes: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year and there are 50 unsold books left. Since she started with 250 books, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. 

We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year. The total number of books sold is 200, and we know the number of books sold in the first and current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from ice cream and milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved
Amount available for gifts = $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
The rest of the family (2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total daily egg consumption for the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to determine Jane's age first. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age since Trent is 5 years older than Jane:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To find the total number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and subtract those who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12
- 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people due to previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

Now, let's subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 - 10 = 14

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:
Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost:
Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and it has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Total number of electric poles required: 15"
"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:
1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
10 - 3 = 7 women

Initially, there were 15 women. So, the number of women left is:
15 - 7 = 8

Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils Jam has: 26 - 2 = 24. This means Jam has 24 pencils in her 3 boxes. 

Now, let's divide the number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8. This means each box can hold 8 pencils.

Now, let's add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Finally, let's divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold to find out how many boxes they need: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to determine how many new records each person got and then calculate the total number of old records they traded.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of old records.

Let's first find the total number of trades: 7 new records were given out, so there were 7 trades.

Since each trade requires 2 old records, the total number of old records is 2 times the number of trades: 2 * 7 = 14.

However, this calculation assumes that each person got the same number of new records. To confirm, let's divide the total number of new records by the number of people: 7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person.

Since each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, 1.4 new records per person would require 1.4 * 2 = 2.8 old records per person. Multiply this by the number of people: 2.8 old records per person * 5 people = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

However, this is incorrect as the 60 would include non-programmers. We need to find the total number of programmers first. Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x. The number of non-programmers is 100 - x.

We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so we can set up the equation:
2/5 * 100 = 2/5 * x + (number of junior programmers that are not part of the total programmers)
However, this equation is not needed as we can simply use the proportion of junior programmers to the total number of programmers to find the total number of programmers.

Let's use the proportion of junior programmers to the total number of programmers to find the total number of programmers:
Number of junior programmers / Total number of programmers = 2/5
40 / Total number of programmers = 2/5
Total number of programmers = 40 * 5 / 2 = 100

This is incorrect as it would mean all employees are programmers. Let's try again.

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining charge percentage and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, the time it will take to fully charge is 40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received on this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they earn $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which gave them a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount they received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is $43 - $12 = $31.

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider RJ and Richard as the same person with 1 gun (we'll ignore the 5 guns mentioned for Richard to avoid duplication).

So, the total number of guns is: 
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard) = 19 guns

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

19 guns / 4 people = 4.75 guns per person

Since you can't have a fraction of a gun, we can round down to 4 guns per person, but the exact calculation gives us 4.75 guns per person.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

x + 2x = 60
Combine like terms:
3x = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can assign the same weight to these three animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs:
- Yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs:
- Red bird: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the animals:
- Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:
- Total weight of the container and animals: 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are also told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we can subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = 19

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Since Sara scored 8 points, three times more points than Sara would be 3 * 8 = 24 points. However, Erin scored 14 points, so we need to subtract those points from the total to find out how many points Erin had before. 

24 (total points Erin has now) - 14 (points Erin scored) = 10 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the frames is:
44 * $20 = $880

Since each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, we need to calculate the etching cost:
20% of $880 = 0.20 * $880 = $176

So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is:
$880 + $176 = $1056

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each:
2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is:
44 / 4 = 11 seniors

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:
11 * $12 = $132

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts:
$1056 (frames with etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the sales for each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

A dozen is equal to 12. Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls and gave one to each of her 6 children. So, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 
6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day. 

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks she washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.1
Time (T) = 5 months = 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount to be paid ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to first determine the number of female choir members. Since the choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls, the number of girls is 52 * 0.5 = 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it, so the number of girls who can perform is 26 * 0.5 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can multiply the value of one part by the respective parts to find the number of popsicles each has. 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since there are 30 days, the total energy used is 7200 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 216,000 watt-hours

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day (8 - 5 = 3) = 2700 watt-hours/day
Since there are 30 days, the total energy used is 2700 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 81,000 watt-hours

Now, we subtract the reduced usage from the original usage to find the energy saved:

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount Sally spent: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $400 * 2 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she'll need for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, she'll need 2 cookies * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we'll divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find the number of dozens needed. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozen cookies.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that meet both conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that are more dangerous and may explode. Since 1% of the candles are not guaranteed not to explode, we can calculate this as:
1% of 50000 = 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles

Now, let's find the number of candles that have a defect and smell like wet dog. This is 5% of the more dangerous candles:
5% of 500 = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = $14 * 4 
= $56

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

To find the number of apples gathered from the average trees, we subtract the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the combined total. This is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this 350 apples is the total gathered by Joanne from the average trees and her sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees. Therefore, the 350 apples is the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into the first equation:
d = 180 - c
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by the number of days.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances for all segments:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
Size of Zack's locker = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Size of Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker
Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Size of Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by the number of remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18.

The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months. However, we only need 8 months of this rate, so:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, but we only need 10 months of this rate:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to get the total cost:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is the negative of that, but since the question asks ""how much more"" we are looking for the absolute difference in the other direction.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade) + 60 (store-bought) = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

We know Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's set up an equation to find the total number of cards:

Number of cards sold = (2/3) * Total number of cards
100 = (2/3) * Total number of cards

To find the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total number of cards = 100 * (3/2)
= 150

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

Now, let's add the costs together: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20): $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Since George had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of $5, which is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95.

Now, subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert the length from yards to feet: 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width of the room. 

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length (9 feet) and the width (40 feet), we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)) to find the perimeter of the room.

- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We already know James' time for the swim and bike ride. To find James' time for the run, we subtract the sum of his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5

These 31 sneakers were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from this sale is:
31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from both sales:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of purchasing the sneakers:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each, then add them together.

Six packets had 8 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the popcorn with a soda costs $1 extra, so the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, let's consider the other option. The movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of this option is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know that the total cost of this option is the sum of the movie ticket, soda, and popcorn. So, we can set up the equation:

$12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn) = $19

Subtracting $12 and $3 from both sides gives us:

x (popcorn) = $19 - $12 - $3
x (popcorn) = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. In this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then subtract the 50 cards she kept for herself. 

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so she has 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so she has 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. 

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. After keeping 50 cards for herself, she has 350 - 50 = 300 cards left to give to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given to the students (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10) to find out how many students Miss Maria has: 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day

Since Charisma works for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes walked per day by the number of days.

40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine her age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in four years = 42

Since this is Angela's age in four years, to find her current age, we need to subtract 4 from this value:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

However, this is not the correct answer because the question states that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, not that Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years. So, we need to subtract 4 from Brett's age to find his age four years from now and then subtract that from Angela's age four years from now to find the difference in their ages. Then we can subtract that difference from Brett's current age multiplied by 3 to find Angela's age four years from now. Then we subtract 4 from that to find Angela's current age.

Brett's age four years from now = 14 + 4 = 18
Angela's age four years from now = 3 * 14 = 42
The difference in their ages = 42 - 18 = 24
The difference in their ages is always 24 years.

Angela's current age = 14 + 24 - 4
Angela's current age = 34

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Paul drove his car for 14 days, so the total number of morning rides is 14, and the total number of afternoon rides is also 14.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.
The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation:
D = B/2

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation:
B + D + L = 43

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
B + B/2 + L = 43

Combine like terms:
(3/2)B + L = 43

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:
(3/2)B + D + 7 = 43

Substitute the first equation into this equation:
(3/2)B + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
(2B) + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:
D = B/2
D = 18/2
D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

364 * 1/4 = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2:
364 * 1/2 = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we'll use that. However, we need to check if Frederick can afford the 2 x 8 wood with his budget.

Frederick has $24. He can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is:
6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of her daily bus trips is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 = 2400). So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + 2400 = 3000.

To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls (3000) by the number of girls (10). 

3000 / 10 = 300

"To find out how many candies Nick has, we first need to determine how many candies George had initially. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can calculate the initial number of candies George had by adding the candies he ate to the candies he has left.

Initial candies George had = candies eaten + candies left
Initial candies George had = 5 + 3
Initial candies George had = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had by multiplying the initial number of candies George had by 2.

Candies Nick had = 2 * initial candies George had
Candies Nick had = 2 * 8
Candies Nick had = 16

"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from her monthly target.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week)
Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15
Total vlogs made so far = 54

Now, subtract the total vlogs made so far from the monthly target:
Vlogs needed to complete the target = 72 (monthly target) - 54 (total vlogs made so far)
Vlogs needed to complete the target = 18

"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He later spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he tripled the $13, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first and second halves.

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April). Both halves have 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves. We can express this as:

15x (first half) + 15(2x) (second half) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since the daily savings in the second half is '2x', we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

The final answer is: $50"

The cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:

4x = 4(20) = 80

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total miles walked per day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles per day.

Now, we multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days he works in a week, which is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The alphabet has 26 letters. Elise writes it in full twice, which is 2 * 26 = 52 letters. Then, she writes half of it once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. 

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters (full alphabet written twice) and the 13 letters (half of the alphabet). So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

In total, Elise has written 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission. 
Commission for the first $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the amount over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission. 
Commission for the amount over $1000 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000 = $300 + $150 = $450.

Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so the total number of bottles he currently has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the comparison, as the question is asking for a comparison between hot and cold days, but the given information is for cold and warm days. Since we do not have information about hot water, we will assume the warm water time is the closest we have to hot water.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water and warm water. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The daily recommended cups of coffee is not explicitly stated, but we know Octavia drinks half of it. Let's call the daily recommended cups of coffee 'x'. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups for Juan's doctor. So, x = 4. 

Now we can calculate how much coffee Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On day three, he saw 0 birds. 
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. 
On day six, he saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

The starting value is 20. 
Half of the number is 20 / 2 = 10. 
The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30. 
This value is then divided by 5, resulting in 30 / 5 = 6. 
The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. 
So, the final value is 6 * 8 = 48.

"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to first determine how many cards the brother has. Since the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has.

The boy has 5 cards.
The brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards they have together.

Total number of cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450°F
Actual temperature: 468°F
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18°F

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100% ≈ 4%

Now, we need to apply this percentage to the desired temperature of 520°F to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to.

Desired temperature: 520°F
Percentage off: 4%
Temperature difference: 520 * (4 / 100) = 20.8°F

Since the oven is running hot, we need to subtract the temperature difference from the desired temperature to get the correct set temperature.

Set temperature: 520 - 20.8 ≈ 499.2°F

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to this gives us a total of 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to this gives us a total of 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together to find the total time: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes

Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = 52 + 68 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the 10% discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of 1 box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her workout. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories she burns is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burns. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit, which is 100 ml. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute difference between the weight loss and weight gain:

Next, let's consider the people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the angles. 

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can calculate Marissa's hourly production rate as follows:
(3/4) * 120 pounds / 2 hours = (3/4) * 60 pounds per hour = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours:
Ruiz's production: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

The total number of seats in the auditorium is 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats are 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats.

The seats occupied by students are the remaining seats after subtracting the seats occupied by administrators and parents, which is 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at one intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we subtract the non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights. 
96 - 20 = 76

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then add them together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times, so it has 1000 - 356 = 644 plays left.
DVD 2 has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, we add the remaining number of plays for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

Total number of plays before they break: 1509"
"To calculate the total cost of physical therapy, we need to determine the total number of hours John spent in therapy sessions. 

Since John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice, the total number of sessions is 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions.

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the remaining 7 pieces.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a few conversions. 

First, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we can convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second by dividing by 1000.

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to convert the time unit from seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining days, then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between that and Adam's current height.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 
48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take him to reach the required height:
8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years.

"To find James' commission, we first need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. 

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference between their speeds, since they are moving in the same direction. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The leather seats cost one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

However, the bonus is not a regular monthly income, so we should calculate the total yearly income by multiplying the new monthly salary by 12 and then adding the bonus.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut. 

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:
Cost of normal brand = $5 per pound
Cost of more expensive brand = $5 + (20% of $5)
= $5 + (0.20 * $5)
= $5 + $1
= $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
Cost of 7 pounds of coffee = 7 * $6
= $42

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is:
Total cost = $42 + $2
= $44

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. 
Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe to find out how many recipes John learns: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

Total good days in the first 8 days = 8
Additional good days = 3
Remaining good days in the first 30 days after the first 8 days = 12 - 8 = 4

Since Christina had 4 good days after the first 8 days, and 3 of those days were in the last 3 days of the 30 days, we can subtract 3 from the 4 good days to find the good days left in the month.

Good days left in the month = 4 - 3 = 1"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 21 - 3, 2x = 18.

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 18 / 2, x = 9.

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches:

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs doubled from 12 to 24. So, James needed 24 toys.

Finally, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys.

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total earnings as follows:

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has:

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the changes Shania made. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5). So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

Then, she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, we can solve for x:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t.

The combined ages of all the children are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combine like terms: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5t = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: t = 6.

Since the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, we can subtract the cost of the lollipops to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies, so the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year.
Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, we multiply the yearly savings by 10.

Rong's total savings = 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
Neil's total savings = 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they still need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raised per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised. 

Total hours = 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%:

40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 = 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

40% - 32% = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then multiply it by the total hours.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the factory can make both flavors simultaneously, we can add the production rates together: 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we multiply the combined production rate by the total hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.

- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can afford with $6.00.

Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, let's divide Erin's budget by the cost of each set: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets, which is 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

However, we need to check if Erin can afford more scoops by buying an additional set of 2 paid scoops. 2 * $1.50 = $3.00, which is more than her remaining budget of $0.00 ($6.00 - $6.00 = $0.00). 

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can calculate the area as follows:

Area to be covered = 2/3 * 36 sq ft
Area to be covered = 2 * 12 sq ft
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. To find the total number of tiles needed, we can multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

Total tiles needed = Area to be covered * Tiles per square foot
Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft
Total tiles needed = 576 tiles

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost plus the cost per pound. 
Initial cost: $20
Cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30
Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
Total cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store.
Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
Total pounds: 30
Total cost of buying at the store = Cost per pound at the store * Total pounds
Total cost of buying at the store = $2.5 * 30
Total cost of buying at the store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.
Amount saved = Total cost of buying at the store - Total cost of picking

New price = Original price + (10% of original price)
New price = $700 + (0.10 * $700)
New price = $700 + $70
New price = $770

The cheese is 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces, so the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The ham is 40 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces (since it's an equal amount to the cheese), so the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for the time with arms raised and the time with arms at her sides, then add them together.

When Helga's arms are raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps for each foot during this time is 200 * 2 = 400 taps per foot. The combined total for both feet is 400 + 400 = 800 taps.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 total minutes - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps for her right foot is 300 * 3 = 900 taps, and the total taps for her left foot is 250 * 3 = 750 taps. The combined total for both feet during this time is 900 + 750 = 1650 taps.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can write the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's calculate the cost difference:
Cost difference = Total cost for the first park - Total cost for the second park
Cost difference = $76 - $48
Cost difference = $28

"To calculate the weekly savings, we need to first find the daily savings. 

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. The cost per tomato from the old vendor is $0.5, and the cost per tomato from the new vendor is $0.4. 

Daily savings = (Cost per tomato from old vendor - Cost per tomato from new vendor) * Number of tomatoes sold per day
Daily savings = ($0.5 - $0.4) * 500
Daily savings = $0.1 * 500
Daily savings = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to get the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = $50 * 7
Weekly savings = $350

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we first need to find out how many marbles each of them has. 

We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. So, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding the number of marbles each of them has. 

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To determine the number of groups needed, we first need to find the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of students per group by the number of groups: 9 students/group * 12 groups = 108 students.

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we divide 54 by 9 (since each group has 9 students): 54 / 9 = 6 groups.

Since the activity requires 12 groups, but we can only form 6 groups with the given number of students, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the number of groups that can be formed: 12 - 6 = 6.

"To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he sent, then subtract the number of broken items.

1 dozen is equal to 12 items. 
So, 8 dozen glasses is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
4 dozen plates is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Initially, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

After the event, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.
So, the number of remaining glasses is 96 - 10 = 86.
The number of remaining plates is 48 - 6 = 42.

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates.
Total = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we should convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, we multiply x by 2:
2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine the total amount he needs to pay for the trip after the school's contribution. 

The school is covering half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. This means John needs to pay the other half, which is also $150.

Since John already has $50, we subtract this from the amount he needs to pay: $150 - $50 = $100.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature difference: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs: 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups and then the number of members who brought seashells.

Given that 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10 groups

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups with seashells = Total number of groups * (3/5)
= 10 * (3/5)
= 6 groups

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members who brought seashells is:

Number of members with seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54 members

Each member brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total seashells = Number of members with seashells * Number of seashells per member
= 54 * 2
= 108

"To find out how much Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours separately.

For the regular 8 hours, Jamie earns $20 per hour. So, her earnings for the regular 8 hours are:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, Jamie is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find the special hourly rate, we multiply her regular hourly rate by 1.5:
$20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find her total earnings for the day, we add her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since the jeans are 25% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $40 - $10
Discounted price = $30

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over.
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money paid to employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money paid after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. 
Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 
The number of stuffed goats will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x. 
The number of other stuffed animals remains the same, which is 14.

We can set up the equation: 
0.3x + 14 = x

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 14
x = 14 / 0.7
x = 20

This means the total number of stuffed animals should be 20. Since she already has 14, the number of stuffed goats she should buy is:
20 - 14 = 6

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play for 30 hours. 
Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between the distance traveled by the second car and the distance traveled by the first car:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area of the mosaic in square inches. 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can divide the total area by the height to find the length. 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts
Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount consumed:
Total tea at the beginning = Total tea consumed + Remaining tea
Total tea at the beginning = 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = Total tea at the beginning (quarts) / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 48 quarts / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 12 gallons

- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person used and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
- Citrus zest: z
- Fragrance: z
- Salt: 2z
- Sugar: 2z
- Oil: 4z

Total amount = z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation:

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate her total amount of money and subtract the cost of the items she bought.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so her total amount of money is $40 + $100 = $140.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20. The total cost of the items she bought is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the cost of the items from her total amount of money: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
   Britany records 18 videos per week, each 4 minutes long. 
   Time spent recording per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Time spent recording per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours/week writing songs. 
   Time spent writing songs per month = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
   Convert hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

3. Time spent on makeup: 
   Britany spends 15 minutes/day, 6 days a week on makeup. 
   Time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Time spent on makeup per month = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Total time spent on TikTok per month = Time spent recording + Time spent writing songs + Time spent on makeup
Total time spent on TikTok per month = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes
Total time spent on TikTok per month = 1128 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, divide by 60: 
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

However, the question does not explicitly ask for the answer in hours, so we will provide the answer in minutes.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first and second parts of his journey and then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

In the first part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. 
Distance covered in the first part = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

In the second part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. 
Distance covered in the second part = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first part + Distance covered in the second part

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that one turtle would take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway. So, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it would take them to cross the highway would be the same as the time it would take one turtle. Therefore, it would take four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add the number of dishes each of them made to find the total number of clay dishes.
Total number of clay dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total number of clay dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total number of clay dishes = 140

The price of the new laptop after trading in the old one is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

We know that $230 of this amount came from her part-time job and her mom, so the amount she had in her purse initially is $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam initially had and then subtract the slices he ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam sliced 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam sliced 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples to get the initial total number of slices. The initial total number of slices is 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30.

Finally, we subtract the slices Adam ate (15) from the initial total number of slices (30) to find out how many slices are left. The number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk his current cows produce. 

The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is used and then subtract that from the total length of the three glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. Since the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the used portion is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. The used portion is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. The used portion is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the used portions: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks
Total number of dishes = 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, let's substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. We can use either A = B - 3 or A = S + 2. We'll use A = B - 3 and A = S + 2 to find a relation between B and S.

From A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we get:

B = S + 5

Now, substitute A = B - 3 and B = S + 5 into the last equation:

We can substitute the first two equations into the third one. First, let's express S and A in terms of F:
A = F - 12
S = A + 25 = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13

Now, substitute S and A into the third equation:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The number of books Fawn has is 28."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we know the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs and then find out how many boxes of jello he needs to buy.

Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

The cost of jello is $1.25 per box, so the total cost will be:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine the total amount Keenan spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we calculate 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Now, we know Keenan spends $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week in a four-week month, we divide the monthly cost by 4:
$160 / 4 = $40

"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days.
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces he ate each day to find the total number of pieces eaten.
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of each.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 
Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. 

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. We can calculate her hourly rate by dividing the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3).

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella's hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours.

Total amount earned = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total amount earned = $11 * 12
Total amount earned = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, Paul had 52 marbles and received 28 more from his friend. So, the total number of marbles he had is:
52 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles from friend) = 80 marbles

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had:
80 (total marbles) - 20 (marbles lost) = 60 marbles

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points.

True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points.

Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell and at what price. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken to make a profit of $2000. 
The total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the number of chickens multiplied by the price per chicken.
180 * $50 = $9000

Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, we subtract the profit from the total amount to find the cost price.
$9000 - $2000 = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we first need to determine the total number of glasses the boys sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, and the total number of glasses sold was 32, the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2. 
18 / 2 = 9

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. 
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and since Sarah is buying a new rope to replace the old one, we assume she wants a rope of the same length, which is 20 meters. So, the total cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:
Profit - Cost of new rope = $40 - $30 = $10

Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age would be 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since Melanie is currently 8 years old, we need to find the difference between 24 and 8 to determine how many years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.
Years required = 24 - 8 = 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide the result by 2, since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as x. The final concert is twice as long, so it's 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, we get 2x + 15 = 65.

Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the total number of cookies left by the number of jars. 

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants: 
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants:
75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total amount she made from mowing lawns: 
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: $18
- Alba's lawn: $30
Total from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the total amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $54 = $26

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Distance rowed by Dijana = 50 miles
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + 10
Distance rowed by Anis = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by adding the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:

Total distance = Distance rowed by Dijana + Distance rowed by Anis
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday. Today, she read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. 
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first. 

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will be eating with their two children, the total number of bowls used for dinner will be 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls were used for dinner, the leftover soup can fill 8 - 4 = 4 child's bowls.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 4 child's bowls of leftover soup, each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

"To find the number of shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of shoe boxes used and subtract that from the total.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is 3. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is 3.

The number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left is:

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * 9
Joseph's initial number of books = 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we subtract the number of books he lost from his initial number of books:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To solve this problem, let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and John's age as J. We are given the following information:

1. P + A + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. A = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = A + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can start by substituting equation (2) into equation (1) to get:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, substitute equation (3) into the above equation:
(A + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute equation (2) into the above equation:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation (2):
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation (3):
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Maria's friends initially had 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
Maria had 1 balloon for herself.
So, the initial total number of balloons was 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so the additional balloons are 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

The total number of balloons is the sum of the initial and additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To determine the number of new tables needed, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

The total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43200 * 6 = $259200.
The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32400 * 6 = $194400.

The difference in revenue between the two machines is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:

Now, the teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. There are 29 pupils in the class, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got from the coupons: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, and the amount he got back from selling the CDs.

The total cost of the CDs without the discount is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

With a 40% discount, James saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sold 5 CDs for $40. To find the cost of these 5 CDs, we can calculate the cost per CD after the discount: $90 / 10 CDs = $9 per CD. The cost of the 5 CDs he sold is 5 CDs * $9 per CD = $45.

James got $40 for the 5 CDs, so he lost $45 - $40 = $5 on those CDs.

However, we need to consider the cost of the remaining 5 CDs, which is $90 - $45 = $45.

In total, James was out $45 (remaining CDs) + $5 (loss on sold CDs) = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. This simplifies to D = A + 10.

Now we can substitute B and D in terms of A into the total points equation: A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points."

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away:

4 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate India's number of states as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25
India's number of states: 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's cherries by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 
Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. We can calculate Jerry's cherries by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total:
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Finally, we can calculate how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:
Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days, then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold over the two days:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total amount earned: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

The total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car = $100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then subtract 5 years from each of their ages to find their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's call his dad's age at that time ""x"". Since Emil is half his dad's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = x/2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 48

So, Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24.

We are also told that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24. Let's call his brother's age at that time ""y"". Since Emil is twice his brother's age, we can set up the equation:

24 = 2y

To solve for y, we divide both sides by 2:

y = 12

So, Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, so we subtract 5 years from his dad's age and his brother's age to find their current ages:

Dad's current age: 48 - 5 = 43
Brother's current age: 12 - 5 = 7

The sum of their current ages is:

43 + 7 = 50

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught and then divide it by the amount in one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants (30 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / Soil per rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backward.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we first need to determine the number of flights the second plane makes, since we know that the second plane's flights are half the number of flights the first plane makes. 

The second plane makes 44 trips per day. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips per day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. 

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights. Since these are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by 15. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size '2x', we can calculate the percentage as (2x / 8x) * 100.

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 + 4125 = 13025 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 13025 = 4975 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before this 3-hour period:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.783
Charge before 3 hours = 35.76%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up an equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.76% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.76% / 0.624
Initial charge = 57.3%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 57%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly earnings are $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is 20% of $10000, which is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

The cost of 3 peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of 4 pears is 4 * $0.5 = $2
The cost of 2 kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can find out how many plums Jamaar can buy by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces she gave away. 

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

Since she gave the sweets to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 / 10 = 78.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests left is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests left is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:
76 + 30 = 106

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests is:

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
60 items * 0.4 = 24 easy questions

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
60 items - 24 easy questions = 36 questions
36 questions / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
Easy questions: 24 * 0.75 = 18

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, she had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

1. Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
2. Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
3. Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of not having a substitute teacher and getting an extension from the normal teacher: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of each fabric piece is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.

Area of each fabric piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers
Number of days = 4

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert it to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people is:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required to cover the entire area. 

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

Now, let's calculate the number of tiles required:
Total area of the kitchen floor = 200 SqFt
Area of each tile = 1 SqFt
Number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Number of tiles required = 200

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost per tile = $12
Number of tiles required = 200
Total cost = Cost per tile * Number of tiles required
Total cost = $12 * 200

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads he does per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads of twin sheets (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). He can do 1 load of king size sheets.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food eaten per day is:
3 cats * 2 meals * 60 grams = 360 grams per day

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

However, we also know that there were 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices available was 4 * 8 = 32 slices.

Since Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared the pizzas, they must have eaten all the slices. Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 32.

"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Donovan's time as 'D' and Betsy's time as 'B'. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so B = D + 18.

We also know that the total time taken for the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's times. So, D + B = 98.

Substituting B = D + 18 into the second equation, we get D + (D + 18) = 98. Combining like terms, we get 2D + 18 = 98.

Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2D = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get D = 40.

Now that we know Donovan's time, we can find Betsy's time by adding 18 to Donovan's time. B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
Total cost = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents
Total cost = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, and 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on each of Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each of Saturday and Sunday. The total extra learning time on weekends is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours.

The total time John spends learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends: 26.67 + 21 = 47.67 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5).

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the initial weight. Therefore, the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas in total.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother) and 6 are unshaken.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100.

Probability (percentage) = 0.25 * 100
Probability (percentage) = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days = 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks. So, the total time for breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for his lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunches and breaks. 

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to determine the number of large jellyfish that change color under UV light, and then work our way backward.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and we are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * large jellyfish = 6

To find the number of large jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 3:

large jellyfish = 6 * 3
large jellyfish = 18

Now, we know that a fifth of the total jellyfish are large. We can set up the equation:

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 5:

total jellyfish = 18 * 5

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we do not have the value of x, we will assume she just started working and provide the answer as 40 years.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the given percentage and number of boys. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240
0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has to complete her journey. Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we can assume June has 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. 

If she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily total is 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey, we divide the total miles by the number of days: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since she is currently hiking 250 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily total: 310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day.

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 
The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional time worked by the other four workers will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, the problem states that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker and the other four workers produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 200 - 200 = 0 toys in the 10 hours that the first four workers worked. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

The first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours. The manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The first four workers produced 200 toys, so the fifth worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. The sum of their eggs is 30, so we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together all four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes (given)
We can calculate 'x' as follows:
2 / x = 40
x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total amount of water in the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces ≥ 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

The final answer: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the total cost will be $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, let's find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. 

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops. 
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
To find out how many potatoes he ate, we multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop. 
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9.

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade, so the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 to invest in the rock stand. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy:
100 / 5 = 20 rocks

If he sells 60% of his inventory, he will sell:
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 * 7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is:
20 * 5 = $100

Since Adam invested $100 and only made $84, he loses:
100 - 84 = $16

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the number of days required for each type of scene, but we need to consider that some days can be used to work on different scenes.

However, in this case, the most efficient way is to work on the scenes that take the longest to complete first. Lauren can work on large-sized scenes for 9 days, then work on small-sized scenes for 7 days (but she will finish 5 small-sized scenes in the 9 days she worked on large-sized scenes, so she will need 7 - (9 * (7/5)) = 7 - 12.6 = -5.6, which is less than 7, so she will need 7 - 5 = 2 more days to finish the small-sized scenes after she finishes the large-sized scenes), and finally work on medium-sized scenes for 6 days (but she will finish 6 * (6/5) = 7.2 medium-sized scenes in the 9 days she worked on large-sized scenes and 2 * (6/7) = 1.7 medium-sized scenes in the 2 days she worked on small-sized scenes, so she will need 6 -

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Mason eats 5 carrots each day on weekends, so he eats 2 x 5 = 10 carrots on weekends.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"To calculate Linus' profit, we need to determine the cost and selling price of the devices. 

The cost price of each device is $20. He sells each device for twice the original price, so the selling price is 2 * $20 = $40 per device.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. 

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120. 

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit earned is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, the additional number of bottles they need to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
- 3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
- 1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows:
- All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 babies
- 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Initially, Abraham had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

The total amount of money Abraham earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, the total payment per week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the production for each year:
- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as 'y'. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is 'y - 7'. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is '4(y - 7)'.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the following equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope length = y - 7
Blue rope length = 12 - 7
Blue rope length = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(Blue rope length)
Red rope length = 4(5)
Red rope length = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Divide both sides by -5:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple. 

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining half is 12 - 6 = 6 pints, which is divided among red, white, and purple.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3. 

6 / 3 = 2

So, 2 pints of red paint was used."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the total number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the additional pods as follows:
20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

Now, we add the additional pods to the original number of pods:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The new box contains 120 pods and costs $12. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost:
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find the number of 20 dollar bills, we divide $1000 by $20:
$1000 / $20 = 50

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so the remaining number of 20 dollar bills is:
50 - 10 = 40

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
40 / 2 = 20

So, he is left with 20 bills. Since each bill is $20, the total amount of money he has is:
20 * $20 = $400

Thomas then triples his money:
$400 * 3 = $1200

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide $1200 by $5:
$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
Total goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. The amount of chalk left is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how much chalk is left that can be used. This is 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches.

However, we are interested in the percentage of the original chalk length that is left, not the actual length. The percentage of chalk left is (2.75 / 5) * 100 = 55%. 

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days the chalk will last, we can divide the percentage of chalk left by the percentage used per day: 55 / 20 = 2.75.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we round down to 2 days, because the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the third day when it becomes too small.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
Total number of books = $27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can calculate the number of books per school as follows:
Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3 schools = 5400 books / 3 = 1800 books per school

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate his snowball-building rate per minute as follows:
20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the melting rate per minute is:
2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

The net rate at which Jay's snowball collection grows is the difference between the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt:
Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15) snowballs per minute
To find a common denominator, we can multiply the first fraction by 5/5:
Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) snowballs per minute
Net rate = 3/15 snowballs per minute
Net rate = 1/5 snowballs per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs:
Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
Time = 60 * 5 minutes
Time = 300 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:
Time = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Time = 5 hours

However, this is the time it would take if Jay starts from 0 snowballs. Since Jay builds snowballs continuously, we can calculate the time it takes to build the first 60 snowballs by considering the time it takes to build the first 20, then the next 20, and so on.

In the first hour, Jay will have 20 - (2 * 4) = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs (since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, 8 snowballs will melt in an hour).
In the second hour, Jay will have 12 + 20 - (2 * 4) = 32 - 8 = 24 snowballs.
In the third hour, Jay will have 24 + 20 - (2 * 4) = 44 - 8 = 36 snowballs.
In the fourth hour, Jay will have 36 + 20 - (2 * 4) = 56 - 8 = 48 snowballs.
In the fifth hour, Jay will have 48 + 20 - (2 * 4) = 68 - 8 = 60 snowballs.

However, Jay will have more than 60 snowballs in the fifth hour. To find the exact time, we can calculate the time it takes to build the last 12 snowballs (60 - 48 = 12).
Time = 12 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
Time = 12 * 5 minutes
Time = 60 minutes

Since Jay already spent 4 hours building the first 48 snowballs, we can add the time it takes to build the last 12 snowballs:
Time = 4 hours + 60 minutes
Time = 4 hours + 1 hour
Time = 5 hours

However, this is still an approximation. To get a more accurate answer, we can convert the 4 hours to minutes and add the time it takes to build the last 12 snowballs:
Time = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 60 minutes
Time = 240 minutes + 60 minutes
Time = 300 minutes

Now, we can subtract the time it takes for 8 snowballs to melt (since Jay will have 68 snowballs and only needs 60):
Time = 300 minutes - (8 snowballs / (2/15 snowballs per minute))
Time = 300 minutes - (8 * 15/2) minutes
Time = 300 minutes - 60 minutes
Time = 240 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:
Time = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Time = 4 hours

60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour
4 hours + 1 hour - 1 hour = 4 hours

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age at that time.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 (used on the second day) + 38 (used on the first day) - 50 (ordered on the first day) = 119 bandages.

Therefore, they started with 119 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost is $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is:
$270 (from hours worked) + $40 (for complete attendance) = $310

"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount earned from each task and then add them together.

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each, so he earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.
- Jason did his laundry once at $3.00, so he earned $3.00 from doing his laundry.
- Jason took the trash out twice at $0.75 each, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50 from taking the trash out.
- Jason cleaned his room once at $1.50, so he earned $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add the total amount earned from each task: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $9.00.

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

Blood in a shark = 3 * Blood in a whale
Blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * Blood in a shark
Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens.

Now, we can find the total number of pens by adding the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately. 

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. 
50% of $60 is $30, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is the cost per bottle multiplied by the number of bottles: 
$90 * 20 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac: 
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on each day:
Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor. So, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling from the total height of the house. Since the height of the second floor's ceiling is not given, we assume it is the same as the first floor's ceiling, which is 180 inches (3 times Mattison's height). 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 420 - 180 - 180 = 60 inches.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share is 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, the remaining shells after team Alphas and team The finders found their share is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

"To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debt, we need to calculate the amount of the loan and the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the value of his house:
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.4 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
Amount used to pay debt = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay debt = 0.6 * $100,000
Amount used to pay debt = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay debt from the loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120
Capacity of John's class = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15
Total capacity of John's school = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school:

Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is:
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar:
Total jelly beans = Effective volume / volume of a single jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.

First, let's add up her scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of her scores is 630. 

Now, let's count the total number of quizzes: 
There are 9 quizzes.

To find the mean score, we divide the sum of her scores by the total number of quizzes: 
630 / 9 = 70

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he was left with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he was left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to determine what number represents 4 quarters (the whole) if 9 novels is 3 quarters of that number.

Let's set up a proportion: 3/4 = 9/x, where x is the total number of novels written this year.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3x = 9 * 4
3x = 36
x = 36 / 3
x = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. 

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day. So, the distance covered in a day is 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km.

Since Michael traveled for 3 days, the total distance covered is 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and the number of grapes used by their mother.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms and then the time spent per day.

Total time spent cleaning all classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes
Total time spent cleaning all classrooms in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, the time spent per day = 20 hours / 5 days = 4 hours per day

Now, we need to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms. 
The custodian works 8 hours a day, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms = (4 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books she has (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55): 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs * $2.40 per dozen = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of:
5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the price per egg is:
$1 / 3 eggs = $0.33 per egg

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:
60 eggs * $0.33 per egg = $20

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost per stick to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents): $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110, which is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

On the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly: 77 - 42 = 35.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car itself, the luggage, and the two children. 

Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
Weight of the two children: 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds
Total weight: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight.

1% of 1600 pounds = (1/100) * 1600 = 16 pounds

Force needed to push the car: 16 pounds"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the dimensions of James' fence, we can plug in the values: 
Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to cover the entire fence.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to find Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total number of hot dogs needed: 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy: 36 / 6 = 6.

Finally, since each pack of hot dogs costs $2, we multiply the number of packs needed by the cost per pack to find the total amount John needs to spend: 6 * $2 = $12.

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Her total earnings are the sum of her earnings from cupcakes and cookies:

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find the number of pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles

We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it would take Vanessa to run the same distance by multiplying Aaron's time by 2.

Time for Vanessa to run 2 miles = 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes

However, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa's speed is constant, we can multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2 to get the time for 4 miles.

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to determine the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends). There are 4 people in total.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

56 / 4 = 14"
