"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's subtract the total eggs used from the total eggs laid:
Total eggs laid: 16
Eggs used: 7
Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9

Now, let's calculate the total amount she makes by selling the eggs:
Eggs left to sell: 9
Price per egg: $2
Total amount made: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the new value. To find the actual selling price, we need to add the $50,000 to the new value of the original house, which is $200,000. But the $50,000 is already included in the 150% increase, so we just need to add the $50,000 to the original value of the house and then multiply by 2.5.

The correct calculation is: ($80,000 + $50,000) * 2.5 = $130,000 * 2.5 = $325,000, or alternatively, $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000 and then add the $50,000 to get $250,000 and then add the remaining $75,000 ($50,000 * 1.5) to get $325,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed her chickens need per day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance he covered in the first 3 hours of driving at 60 mph. Since he turned around, this distance will be subtracted from the total distance he needs to cover to get home.

Distance covered in the first 3 hours = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he covered during the 4 hours of trying to get home.

- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so the distance covered is 0 miles.
- He spent the next half-hour driving at 30 mph. 
  Distance covered in half an hour = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time driving at 80 mph. 
  Time spent driving at 80 mph = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
  Distance covered in 1.5 hours = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Total distance covered in the 4 hours = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

Since the total revenue is still less than the total cost at the end of year 5, we need to calculate for year 6. At the end of year 6, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108). 

However, if we calculate the profit for year 6, we get $63 (revenue) - $108 (cost) = -$45 (loss) for the first 6 years. For year 7, the loss will be $45 + $3 (cost) - $10.50 (revenue) = $37.50. For year 8, the loss will be $37.50 + $3 - $10.50 = $30. For year 9, the loss will be $30 + $3 - $10.50 = $22.50. For year 10, the loss will be $22.50 + $3 - $10.50 = $15. For year 11, the loss will be $15 + $3 - $10.50 = $7.50. For year 12, the loss will be $7.50 + $3 - $10.50 = -$0.50 (profit of $0.50).

However, we can see that the loss is decreasing by $7.50 each year. So, we can calculate the year when the loss becomes zero or a profit. 

Year 6 loss is $45. 
Year 7 loss is $37.50. 
Year 8 loss is $30. 
Year 9 loss is $22.50. 
Year 10 loss is $15. 
Year 11 loss is $7.50. 
Year 12 loss is -$0.50 (profit of $0.50).

Year 6 loss is $45. 
Year 12 loss is -$0.50 (profit of $0.50). 
Year 6 to year 12 is 6 years. 
$45 / 6 years = $7.5 per year. 
$7.5 * 6 = $45. 
$7.5 * 5 = $37.50. 
$7.5 * 4 = $30. 
$7.5 * 3 = $22.50. 
$7.5 * 2 = $15. 
$7.5 * 1 = $7.50. 
$7.5 * 0 = $0. 
$0.50 is the profit. 
$7.5 - $0.50 = $7. 
$7 / $7.5 = 0.9333. 
0.9333 * 6 = 5.6 years. 
6 - 5.6 = 0.4 years. 
0.4 * 12 = 4.8 months. 
6 years and 4.8 months is 6.4 years.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit: $125"

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11 lego sets.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets.

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week. 

He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) the other two days. So, the total time he spends running is:
3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we first need to determine her running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

One-third of six hours is 6 / 3 = 2 hours, and two-thirds of six hours is 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.

Distance = speed * time. 
Distance covered while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

Total distance covered = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find the distance outside of the flames where she can still hit the dragon.

1200 - 1000 = 200

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to research and write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is 80 + x - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we can add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Now, we can subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units:
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books will weigh 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon. We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = total miles / total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons the tank can hold.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 more and got 23 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had is:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, we subtract the stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds. 

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. 
4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 500 pounds, so Alex's weight is 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we need to find their combined weights. 
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22. 

Since they won 8 more than they lost, we can express this as W = L + 8. 

We also know that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, so W + L = 22.

Substituting W = L + 8 into the equation W + L = 22, we get (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W by using W = L + 8: W = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase. 
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
Her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.

However, this increase happens every year for the next three years. 
After the first year, her monthly salary will be $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $726.
After the second year, her monthly salary will be $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $798.6.
After the third year, her monthly salary will be $798.6 + 0.1 * $798.6 = $878.46.

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary.
Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the expected number of attendees by 0.75.

Gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16, which gives us 4. This means Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used. 4 * 3 = 12.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract those from the total pages.

Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also has a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends, but since he has a soda on one of the weekend days, we subtract 1 glass, making it 7 - 1 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

First, we know that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry had 110 cookies. So before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he meant to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation: 2x = 100, where x is the number of cookies he baked last year.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can calculate the distance per second and multiply it by the total time it took her to reach the shore.

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second
Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. To find the total amount of water taken on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply it by 2.

Total amount of water = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 16 liters

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamped 20 letters. To find out how many were in the pile initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x. 

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 
We also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.

So, the total number of spoons Julia had when setting the table is the sum of the spoons in the package she bought (x), the spoons her husband bought (5), minus the spoons she used to sample the stew (3).

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms: x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 10

Number of spoons in the package Julia bought: 10"

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Cost to the hospital per hour: $150
Total cost to the hospital per day: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Revenue from patients per hour: $200
Total revenue from patients per day: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since Nissa hired 60 elves, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

After 20 elves quit, the remaining number of elves is 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, the number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian had before he lost 5. Brian had 20 video games and lost 5, so he originally had 20 + 5 = 25 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. Since Brian originally had 25 video games, we multiply 25 by 3 to get 3 times as many video games as Brian. 25 * 3 = 75.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, so we subtract 5 from 75. 75 - 5 = 70.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
The number of questions Mark completed in the first test is 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
The number of questions Mark completed in the second test is 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Number of eggs per flan: 3
Total eggs needed: 15 * 3 = 45

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total profit and then work backwards to find their total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know their profit is the amount they made minus the amount they spent, we can set up an equation. Let's say they made x gallons of lemonade.

Their total revenue is $10x (since they make $10 per gallon). Their total cost is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x.

Their profit is $10x - $5x = $5x. We know their profit is $25, so $5x = $25.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5. This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Since they spent $3 per gallon on lemons, they spent a total of $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

According to the second statement, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago, so we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 years: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is:

P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probabilities:

P(two even numbers) = P(even) × P(even) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities:

Difference = P(>3) - P(two even numbers) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage difference = 0.25 × 100 = 25%

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters from the total straw given to the rats and hamsters to find the straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
Total slices for lunch = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
Total slices for breakfast = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Total slices of cheese used = Total slices for lunch + Total slices for breakfast + Total slices for dinner
Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices
Total slices of cheese used = 31 slices

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she initially had is:
22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is:
6 (bags) * 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is:
2 (bags) * 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of blue and red pens she bought:
32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the five tests after removing the lowest score. 

Since she wants an average of 93 and there are 5 tests after removing the lowest score, we multiply 93 by 5 to get the total score needed: 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of her first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

We need to remove the lowest score, which is 71. So, the total score after removing the lowest score is: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score of the five tests after removing the lowest score, including the sixth test. We already know this should be 465. 

So, the score she needs on the sixth test is: 465 - 367 = 98.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. 
Distance covered in a week = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers
Distance covered in four weeks = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.
Distance covered in a week = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers
Distance covered in three weeks = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

The total cost of buying each cup is the total cost of twenty dozen cups divided by the number of cups. 
Total cost per cup = $34800 / 240
Total cost per cup = $145

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens Jerry has is 4."
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes. 
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

   Water left = Initial water - Water used
   Water left = 120 - 90
   Water left = 30 liters

2. Calculate the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice as much as what was left:

When the ink runs low in these pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from the initial 25 pens, he can create 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, Ram has the initial 25 pens and the 5 new pens he created, totaling 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

However, the ink from the 5 new pens can also be mixed to create more pens when they run low. Since there are 5 new pens, Ram can create 5 / 5 = 1 more pen.

So, Ram now has 30 pens and 1 more pen, totaling 30 + 1 = 31 pens.

But the ink from this 1 new pen can also be mixed to create another pen when it runs low. Since there's 1 pen, Ram can create 1 / 5 = 0.2 pens, but since we can't have a fraction of a pen, we can create 1 more pen by mixing the ink from this pen and 4 other empty pens that Ram might have from other sources or by buying more pens. However, the question only mentions the 25 pens Ram bought, so we will not consider this last pen.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 
So, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries before Ginger gave him some.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation is: 28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and multiply it by the hourly rate, then apply the discount.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for the entire movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:
9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. The total number of girls is also 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the cows. So, we assume there were 10 stalls initially, but after Mr. Sylas buys the cows, the cows are divided among 20 stalls.

Initially, 10 stalls have 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has the initial number of cows (which is 20 for the first 10 stalls and 0 for the new 10 stalls) plus 2 cows. For the first 10 stalls, the total number of cows is 20 + 2 = 22 cows per stall.

We need to find the total number of cows in 8 stalls. Since the first 10 stalls have 22 cows each, we can choose 8 stalls from the first 10 stalls to get the maximum number of cows.

So, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * 22 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal) and subtract the result from the total weight.

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to get the total number of dozens. 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to get the total amount of flour needed. 5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour.

Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75 pounds
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks would not be enough to carry all 80 flagstones (as 3 * 2000 = 6000, which is the total weight, but 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the total weight), we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all flagstones are transported.

Number of trucks = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Now, divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes break = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first calculate the points each player has after 3 rounds and then add the extra points.

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not get an extra point.

Mike's new total: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim's new total: 18 points (no change)
Tony's new total: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the points of all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

42 kg / 14 kg = 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000
Total bonus given to the driver per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the pages are paired in a way that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

This arrangement still results in 16 pieces of paper, but the pages are paired differently.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate how much she spent and subtract that from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.

In addition to the $25 spent on food and snacks, she also spent $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.
His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so his total bonus is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage in a month is $500 * 4 = $2000.
Adding the total bonus, Watson's total earnings in April is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find out how many loaves are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on 1 packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can write the equation:
D + O + S = 105

We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so we can write:
O = 2D

We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write:
S = D/2

Now, we can substitute the expressions for O and S into the first equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D + D/2) = 105
(4D + D)/2 = 105
(5D)/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2:
5D = 210

Divide both sides by 5:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we don't know how many of the remaining employees are programmers. Let's assume the remaining employees (100 - 40 = 60) include both senior programmers and non-programmers. We will assume all 60 are either senior programmers or non-programmers, but we only need to find the number of senior programmers.

We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, but we are not given the exact number of senior programmers. However, we can infer that the number of senior programmers is the remaining programmers after junior programmers. Let's assume the number of senior programmers is x.

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

In the morning, he eats 2 more, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to charge 40% as follows:

Time = (40 percentage-points) * (3 minutes/percentage-point) 
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time = 120 minutes / 60 
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to add the lollipops she initially had to the ones her mother gave her, then subtract the ones she gave to Ella.

Erin initially had 7 lollipops. 
Her mother gave her 10 more lollipops, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
Erin gave 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

Applying the coupon, the final price becomes $39 - $8 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes: $30,000/year * 20% = $6,000/year
Net income: $30,000/year - $6,000/year = $24,000/year

Job B:
Gross income: $42,000/year
Property tax: $6,000/year
Net income before tax: $42,000/year - $6,000/year = $36,000/year
Taxes: $36,000/year * 10% = $3,600/year
Net income: $36,000/year - $3,600/year = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to calculate the difference between the two jobs:
$32,400/year - $24,000/year = $8,400/year

"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer.

Furniture United's offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,350
- 6 monthly installments of $350 each: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- 9 monthly installments of $250 each: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names - 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider Richard as having 1 gun (not 5) to avoid duplication.

So, the total number of guns is: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (Richard) + 5 (Jason, not mentioned earlier but assuming Jason has the remaining guns) is incorrect as Jason was mentioned to have no guns, so we will use the 5 guns for Richard instead of 1.

"To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, let's find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we know that the smallest group has 'x - 10' students. So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

70 - 10 = 60

"To find the total number of legs, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. The number of chickens will be 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals: 
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, we calculate the additional distance as 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance.
5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

"To find the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings.

When the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, so their daily earnings were:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, so their daily earnings are:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

The difference in daily earnings is:
$1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, divide the difference by the original daily earnings and multiply by 100:
($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

The monthly cost of treats is $20.

The monthly cost of medicine is $100.

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent, so we can set up the equation: 
0.3 * Total time = 15 hours
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in a day and then divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the daily distance.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, which is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the daily distance: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50

Total number of tennis shoes sold: 50"
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

- Tuesdays: 1 hour
- Thursdays: 2 hours

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000, and 40% of the equipment is faulty. 

First, we calculate the cost of the faulty equipment: 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

Now, we subtract the cost of the faulty equipment from the total cost to find the cost of the functioning equipment:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples she picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50

"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of socks in pairs and add the loose socks. 

Since each pair has 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks will be 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 
Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for 5 months, it's (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time 
= $3,650 * 4.17% 
= $3,650 * 0.0417 
= $152.055 

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
= $3,650 + $152.055 
= $3,802.055 

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5: 
Monthly payment = $3,802.055 / 5 
= $760.411 

Rounded to two decimal places, the monthly payment is approximately $760.41.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio: 165 / 11 = 15.

Now that we know each part represents 15 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

- Recording: half of 240 minutes = 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time:
Total time = Writing + Recording + Editing
Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total time = 450 minutes

Now, let's calculate the percentage of time spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Editing time / Total time) * 100

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- Half of 30 apples (15 apples) from the shortest trees
- An unknown number of apples (let's call it x) from the average trees

Her sister gathered:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples
- No apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine the constants:
30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150

Now the equation becomes:
150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:
x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

We know that each camel has one head and two humps, and each dromedary has one head and one hump. We are given that there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

We can set up two equations based on this information:

1. The total number of heads: c + d = 180
2. The total number of humps: 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations to find the number of dromedaries. 

First, let's isolate 'c' in the first equation: c = 180 - d

Now, substitute 'c' in the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Expanding the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304

Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides: -d = -56

Multiply both sides by -1: d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats took some away is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months at $14 per month.
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer will be negative.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then:

Number of cards sold = 2/3 * x
100 = 2/3 * x

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00. 
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width) to find the width:
360 square feet = 9 feet * width
width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)) to find the perimeter:
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to calculate James' total time and subtract it from Jon's total time.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is:
40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James' bike ride time is:

Let's denote James' run time as x. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the equation:
Jon's total time - James' total time = 10
170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Now, let's solve for x:
170 - 121 - x = 10

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the popcorn with a soda costs $1 extra, so the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, let's consider the option where you buy a regular movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. The movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of this option is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know that the total cost of this option is the sum of the movie ticket, soda, and popcorn. So, we can set up the equation:

$12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn) = $19

The volume of each raised bed is 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

The answer is: 2"
"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks is x/2. He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. The total number of cookies he wants to eat is 5.

So, the equation is: x/2 + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 
x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for x:

Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2 or B = 2D.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

Lastly, we know that the total number of insects found is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting B = 2D into the last equation, we get L + D + 2D = 43, which simplifies to L + 3D = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 into the equation L + 3D = 43, we get (D + 7) + 3D = 43, which simplifies to 4D + 7 = 43.

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4D = 36.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get D = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L by substituting D = 9 into L = D + 7, which gives us L = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other two packs of gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For 2 x 4 wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8 wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we'll use that. 

Now, we'll divide Frederick's budget by the cost of 2 x 8 wood to find out how many pieces he can buy: 
$24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, we multiply the number of pieces by the number of sticks per piece:
4 * 400 = 1600

The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is:
6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 200 days

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue. 

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. However, the cost is given per pack, not per bag. So, the total cost is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Tara sold the bags for $8 each. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find the amount he gave to his sister, and finally determine the amount he spent on dinner.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Initial daily consumption: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
New daily consumption: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the total weekly consumption in kWh.
Initial weekly consumption: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
New weekly consumption: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kWh to get the weekly bill.
Initial weekly bill: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024
New weekly bill: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the new bill minus the initial bill.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs. 
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84

Now, we add the initial 65 letters to the re-written 65 letters: 65 + 65 = 130 letters

Total number of letters Elise has written: 130"
"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James has 80 toys, so five times that amount is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

However, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this amount. This means the number of toys he currently has plus 2 is equal to 400. 

Let's represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. Then, x + 2 = 400. 

To find x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

The total cost of the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the amount over $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

To find the total amount Antonella earned, we add the commission from the first $1000 and the commission from the amount over $1000:

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, we multiply 70 by 2.

70 guests * 2 bottles per guest = 140 bottles

Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so we multiply 2 by 24 to find out how many bottles he already has.

2 cases * 24 bottles per case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he wants.

140 bottles (wanted) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes per mile.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to determine how much coffee Octavia and Juan currently drink.

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from Juan's current coffee intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages / 1.5 * 1.5 = 140 / 1.5 * 1 = 140 / 1.5 = 93.33 pages, round down to 93 pages (as you can't read a fraction of a page), but for the sake of calculation, we will use 93.33 pages.

However, we will use the actual pages read in the first week as 93.33 pages, and in the second week, she read 100 pages. So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 93.33 + 100 = 193.33 pages.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as x. We can set up the equation: 51 = 3x.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since x represents the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from x: 17 - 7 = 10.

Original price of 1 box: $100.00
Discount: 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Total cost of 2 boxes: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, and assuming Pete wears 1 pair of contacts per day, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts and last 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
Cost per pair of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories she burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements by adding them up and dividing by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
8.75 pounds (gained) - (-6.25 pounds) (lost) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is:
100 (initial invitees) + 100 * 2 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, let's consider the people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, as she will also be attending the event. So, the total number of seats needed is:

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8. The total cost on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two options. To do this, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the amount of protein he gets per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per day. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein John gets per week by multiplying the amount of protein he gets per day by 7:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: 
$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the angles.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins to their respective values in cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours:
120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production rate:
(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours):
Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:
720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Now, let's calculate the total rotations per year:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles per month = 145,000 rotations per month.
145,000 rotations per month * 12 months per year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

"To find the cost of each pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps as follows:

Total number of pumps = 2 pumps * 120 washings = 240 pumps

Now, we know the total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we can divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

Since we need the answer in cents, we can convert the cost per pump to cents by multiplying by 100:

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Joe has $50, and he spends $42 on the outfit. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost from his initial amount: $50 - $42 = $8.

Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. 

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference between their speeds, since they are moving in the same direction. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she can process twice the number of customers Jewel does. 

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples * $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges * $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The leather seats cost one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Now, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes:
6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns.

"To find out by how much they exceeded the maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator and subtract the maximum load.

There are 9 adults in total (Jack and 8 others). The total weight of the adults is 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight: 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has: 
Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

Total number of cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The final answer: 80"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, the time taken for this part is half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, the time taken for this part is half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for both modes: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation as 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin. T = t + 7, so T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:
Neil's savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings = 20 + (4 * 20 / 5)
Neil's savings = 20 + 16
Neil's savings = 36

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400

Neil's total savings = 36 * 120
Neil's total savings = 4320

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
Total coins = 2400 + 4320
Total coins = 6720

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has. 

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raised per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, let's subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The total cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt and the potential fine from the city council. 
3 buckets of asphalt cost 3 * $25 = $75.
Adding the potential fine, the total cost is $75 + $120 = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to his car, which is $450. 
By fixing the pothole, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255.

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. 

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores.
6 adults want 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores.
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed.
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B got 150% of candidate A's votes, or 1.5 times candidate A's votes:
1.5 * 20 = 30 votes

Now, we can find the total number of votes received by candidates A and B:
20 (A) + 30 (B) = 50 votes

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. A large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

In total, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90
Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she spent on the candy bars. 

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. 

Since the candy bars are sold at $5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars she bought. 

$60 / $5 = 12

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so Ezra's new total is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total hours available and the hours spent on other activities.

Total hours available: 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Hours spent reading: 3 hours

Remaining hours after reading: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Hours spent playing video games: 1/3 of 9 hours = 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours

Hours spent playing soccer: 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer:

Percentage spent playing soccer = (Hours spent playing soccer / Total hours) * 100

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the normal movie cost, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost for series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5. Let's calculate the number of older movies:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies
Total cost for older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10. Let's calculate the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
Total cost for normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30z
Points from time for Ava: 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between Ava's total points and Emma's total points:
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = -25

The difference between their two scores is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas. 

First, we find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the other two days.

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these two days is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

The total number of rides in a week is the sum of the rides on the usual days and the other two days: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish as 'o'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write an equation:

w + o = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write another equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtract 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, substitute the expression for 'o' into the first equation (w + o = 17):

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide by 3:

w = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

In a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so we multiply the number of twenties by 3/5, then multiply the result by the value of each twenty:
10 twenties * (3/5) = 6 twenties

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees/month) * 3 (months) = 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month after three months will be:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total amount paid for the first three months. 
For the first month, the company pays 200 * $4000 = $800,000.

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the cost of the materials (diamond and gold) and then add the premium.

The cost of the materials is $600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900.

The premium is 30% of the cost of the materials, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost James paid is the cost of the materials plus the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500.
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100.
The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, which is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

The total number of students who took the test is:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test:
700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area of the mosaic in square inches. 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can divide the total area by the height to find the length. 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed by all the students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide the total amount of tea by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, Dale sold 150 candies before ordering the additional 100. So, the number of candies he still has is 200.

Since he wants to sell all of his candies, we subtract the number he has already sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200). 

200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies."
"To find the number of additional students, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
320 (total students) - 10 (initial students) = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 

14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
- Citrus zest: z
- Fragrance: z
- Salt: 2z
- Sugar: 2z
- Oil: 4z

Total amount = z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation: 
10z = 10

Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 
z = 1

Now, we can find the amount of oil: 
Oil = 4z = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And we can find out how many cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only. The rest of the students who are good at both subjects can be found by subtracting the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7

"To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time taken by each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which implies they will build double the amount they have built so far, not that they will build double the amount they have built and add it to the previous amount.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:

A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as 'M'.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope:
Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total profit = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total profit = 20 * $2
Total profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming she wants the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Total cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Total cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Total cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over:
Money left over = Total profit - Total cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

"To find Melanie's present age, we subtract 10 from 18 since that's how old she'll be in 10 years. 
Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since Melanie is currently 8 years old, we subtract 8 from 24 to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old.
Years it will take = 24 - 8 = 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: 
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: $18
- Alba's lawn: $30
Total money from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, the total material needed for the small masks is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the exact amount needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, the total material needed for the large masks is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

Colby saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50.
He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on snacks.

He has $20 - $10 = $10 left for the movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10. He can afford 1 more movie.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we first need to calculate the calories in one mini pastry of each type. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories.
A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the mini pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories

Total calories from all pastries: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the bus: Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles
For the car: Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J. 

We know that P + L + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old).

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John).

We are also given that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

We can substitute L from the second equation into the third equation: P = (J + 10) + J.

Combine like terms: P = 2J + 10.

Now, substitute P and L from the last two equations into the first equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age: L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age: P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so the friends had 4 * 2 = 8 water balloons. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total initial number of balloons was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so the additional number of balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (9) to the additional number of balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To find out how many new tables the charity group needs, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes of stuff already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need in total. 
60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables they need. 
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

The total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43200 * 6 = $259200.
The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32400 * 6 = $194400.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining money is:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining money is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Since James got the CDs for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 from selling the unwanted CDs.

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut, the time is 3 * 15 minutes = 45 minutes.
For the 5 racquets with polyester string, the time is 5 * 22 minutes = 110 minutes.
For the 4 racquets with hybrid sets, the time is 4 * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each phone. 

The first two phones are full price, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200. 

The remaining phones (for the 2 kids) are half price, so that's 2 * ($600 / 2) = $600.

Now, we add the cost of all the phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the dimensions of the fence, we can plug in the values: 
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she initially had. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, so she gave away a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she initially had:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, so she kept:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries Richard and Jerry have.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have a combined total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. To find the number of cherries Jerry has, we subtract the combined total of Robert and Richard from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now, we can find the difference between Robert's cherries and Jerry's cherries:

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days, and then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total amount earned: $150 + $390 = $540

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then calculate their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, we subtract 5 years from their ages at that time to find their current ages.

Emil's dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
Emil's brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught and then divide it by the weight of one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total pounds of crawfish Joe caught is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants.

1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because we can't have a partial plant, and we already have 17 plants, so we'll need to buy the remaining plants).

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store. To find out how much money Pat will spend, we multiply the number of flowers she needs to buy by the cost of each flower.

27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. 
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00. 
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / 1 pound/rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we can multiply the time it takes her to sauté 30 shrimp by 3, since 90 is 3 times 30.

10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them.

15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backwards.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane takes to France in a day, we need to determine the total number of flights the first plane makes and then calculate the number of flights to France.

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany combined is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 11 flights.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

1500 * 0.25 = 375 male students

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 
3000 * 0.5 = 1500 students

Now, let's find the number of male students under 16 years old: 
1500 * 0.5 = 750 male students

Now, let's find the total number of male students: 
375 + 750 = 1125 male students

"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to determine the number of laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before this 3-hour period:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / 0.79
Charge before 3 hours = 35.44%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up an equation to find the initial charge:

Initial charge = 35.44% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Initial charge = 35.44% / 0.59
Initial charge = 60%

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 60%."
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

The down payment is 20% of the $10,000 car. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income. 
She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. 
Total hourly income = $10/hour + $15/hour = $25/hour

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her total weekly income is:
Total weekly income = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
Number of weeks = Total amount needed / Total weekly income
= $2,000 / $1,000/week
= 2 weeks

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Jamaar has $0.75 left to spend on plums. Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces she gave away.

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

She gave the 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

780 / 10 = 78

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we first need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums = 72 / 8 = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. 

Number of selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums = 9 * 3 = 27
Number of portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums = 9 * 2 = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits = 27 + 18 = 45

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests left is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they haven't checked out yet, so we don't subtract them from the total.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

After dinner, 7 more people checked in. So, the total number of guests who checked in is:
30 + 7 = 37

Now, we add the number of guests who checked in to the number of guests left after the early checkout:
76 + 37 = 113

However, we still need to subtract the 15 guests who elected for a late checkout, as they will eventually check out. But since the problem asks for the current number of guests, we don't subtract them yet.

The final answer is: 113"

"To find the total points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions are easy.
Number of easy questions = 40% * 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions by subtracting the number of easy questions from the total and dividing by 2.
Number of average and difficult questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18 each

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct.
Number of easy questions correct = 75% * 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Number of average questions correct = 50% * 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
Number of difficult questions correct = 50% * 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Total points Aries is sure to get = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get $4 * 2L = $8 * L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: $12 * L + $8 * L = $120. Combining like terms, we get $20 * L = $120.

Dividing both sides by $20, we get L = 6. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this value to get S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, then multiply it by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days:

The original price of the new bedroom set is $3000. 
He pays $1000 from selling his old bedroom set, so the remaining amount is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we calculate 10% of $2000.
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance that she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30%), there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 30% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know 'x' (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Depreciation for the first year (2007-2008) = 21% of $20000 = 0.21 * $20000 = $4200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Depreciation for the second year (2008-2009) = 21% of $15800 = 0.21 * $15800 = $3318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15800 - $3318 = $12482

Depreciation for the third year (2009-2010) = 21% of $12482 = 0.21 * $12482 = $2620.42
Price of the car in 2010 = $12482 - $2620.42 = $9861.58

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German. 

There are 50 books in total. Half of them are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 * 0.5 = 25.

10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

Now, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)
= 50 - (25 + 5)
= 50 - 30
= 20

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to calculate the total distance she has driven so far and subtract it from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers
Number of days = 4

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert it to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people is:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food they eat per day (360 grams). 

720 / 360 = 2

Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

However, we also know that there were 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices available was 4 * 8 = 32 slices. Since they can't eat more slices than are available, we can confirm that our calculation is correct.

Total slices eaten: 31"
"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, let's denote Donovan's time as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken for the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's time, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's time is 'x + 18', we can now find Betsy's time:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18
Betsy's time = 58

3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of small coupons and big coupons:
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

"To find the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day, and 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on each Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each Saturday and Sunday. Since there are two weekend days, he spends a total of 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes on extra learning time per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours per week.

The total time John spends learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time: 26.67 + 21 = 47.67 hours per week.

The initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3rds of its starting height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball goes to 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the other children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5).

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 bags * $5/bag
= $1000

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms eaten by the Allosaurus.

Since the Allosaurus ate the last portion, the velociraptors must have left 270 kilograms. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, so they must have eaten half of the remaining portion. This means the remaining portion after the T-Rex ate was 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the triceratops initially had 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100.

Probability percentage = 0.25 * 100
= 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people Billy helps is 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in time:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks, so the total time for breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for his lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunches and breaks. 

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discount.

Frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 (discount)
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 (discount)
Set of towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish

We also know that the large jellyfish make up a fifth of the total number of jellyfish in the tank. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 * $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her desired annual retirement income for 20 years. We'll also assume she doesn't expect any returns on her savings.

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 * $100,000
= $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can say she needs to work for 40 years in total to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she has already worked for some years, let's assume she has worked for 'x' years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we do not have the value of 'x', we will assume she has just started working and provide the answer as 40 years.

0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract her planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles per day she must hike: 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional production after the 10-hour shift will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys.

However, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together the four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. 

So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles/minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:

1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes

The total time for the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. To find the number of women, we can find the fraction of the total parts that women represent and multiply it by the total number of passengers.

Women's fraction = 9/14
Total number of women initially = (9/14) * 84
Total number of women initially = 9 * 6
Total number of women initially = 54

Now, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the total number of women initially.

Number of women who remained = Total number of women initially - Number of women who alighted
Number of women who remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who remained = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100, and he invests all of it in buying rocks at $5 each. The number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:
20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:
$100 - $84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene. But in this case, we can also consider that she can work on different scenes on different days. So, the total number of days will be the sum of the days for each type of scene, but we can also consider the maximum days required for any scene type and then check if other scenes can be completed in the same time frame or less.

Considering the above, let's check if the scenes can be completed in the maximum days required for any scene type. The maximum days required is 9 days for large-sized scenes. 

In 9 days, she can draw 9 * 5 = 45 large-sized scenes (done), 9 * 6 = 54 medium-sized scenes (more than required), and 9 * 7 = 63 small-sized scenes (more than required). However, she only needs 36 medium-sized scenes and 49 small-sized scenes. So, she can complete all the scenes in 9 days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. This is done by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.12 * 100 = 12%

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5.
$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk. 
20% of the original 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the chalk until it is 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk that can be used before it needs to be recycled.

Now, we can divide the remaining usable chalk (0.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, we also need to consider the days the teacher has already used the chalk. 
The teacher used the chalk for 1 day on Monday and will use it for 2 more days until the chalk is 2.75 inches. On the third day, the teacher will use 1 inch of chalk and have 1.75 inches left. On the fourth day, the teacher will use 1 inch of chalk and have 0.75 inches left. The teacher will not be able to use the chalk on the fifth day because it will be too small.

So, the teacher has 4 days before he has to recycle this piece.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to find out how many gallons of milk were returned. Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we multiply the total gallons by 2/5.

Total gallons = 4000
Gallons returned = 4000 * (2/5) = 4000 * 0.4 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the gallons returned by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.

Refund amount = Gallons returned * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Colin is 20 years old now."
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per dollar: 
100 books / $500 = 0.2 books per dollar.

Now, we can calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000:
0.2 books per dollar * $27000 = 5400 books.

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can calculate the number of books per school:
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

"To find out how many apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. He threw this 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has the apples in his pocket (5) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11 apples.
4. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

So, Newton brought home the apples he had in his pocket (5 from the previous step + 1 from the very beginning) and the 6 apples that fell in the last step."

First, let's calculate the number of 50 kg bags:
Total weight of coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight per bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total weight of coal ordered / Weight per bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15: 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we can find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs per minute by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age at the time of the anniversary.

John's age at the time of the anniversary = John's current age - 20 years
John's age at the time of the anniversary = 28 - 20
John's age at the time of the anniversary = 8 years

Since John was twice as old as Jim at the time of the anniversary, we can calculate Jim's age at that time.

Jim's age at the time of the anniversary = John's age at the time of the anniversary / 2
Jim's age at the time of the anniversary = 8 / 2
Jim's age at the time of the anniversary = 4 years

Now, we can calculate Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at the time of the anniversary.

Jim's current age = Jim's age at the time of the anniversary + 20 years
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 (used on the second day) + 38 (used on the first day) - 50 (ordered on the first day) = 119 bandages.

Therefore, they started with 119 bandages on the first day.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean. The total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the cost per year is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board.

We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning he will need.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. 

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
b = 3c - 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:
c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:
4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:
4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:
c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 
20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 
So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours he traveled in 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered:

210 / 7 = 30 batches

Now, we know Jade uploads 6 batches each day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of batches (30) by the number of batches per day (6).

30 / 6 = 5 days

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 450 by 10.

Total words = 450 * 10 = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 / 375
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people for each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the total number of popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: The boat depreciated by 30% of its original value.
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: The boat depreciated by 30% of its value after 1 year.
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = Value after 1 year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: The boat depreciated by 20% of its value after 2 years.

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, let's subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to first determine how many items Igor gathered. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He gathered the correct number of beakers, but we don't know how many he lost yet, so we'll call the number of beakers he gathered 'x'. We know he was supposed to gather 7 beakers.

We know the total number of items Igor gathered is 29. So we can set up the equation: 
8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants: 
24 + x = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides: 
x = 5

Since Igor gathered 5 beakers, but was supposed to gather 7, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each person and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each person:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can calculate the distance Aaron ran as follows:

Distance Aaron ran = Distance Vanessa ran / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile as follows:

Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = Total time Aaron took / Distance Aaron ran
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 8 minutes

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile is twice the time it takes Aaron to run one mile:

Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * 8 minutes
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles:

Time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile * Distance Vanessa ran
Time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = 16 minutes * 4
Time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = 64 minutes

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total amount of line required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total amount made per week is $90 * 2 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price with a 25% profit.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to calculate the selling price with a 25% profit.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, we find John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The youngest son's current age is 5 years. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the radiator cost and the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

So each person can have 14 slices.
