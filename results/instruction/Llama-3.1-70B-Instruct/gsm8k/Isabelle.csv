"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings at the farmers' market are 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5 (250% = 2.5).

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can set up an equation to find the actual selling price.

Let x be the selling price. The increase in value due to repairs is $50,000, which is 150% of the original value. So, the selling price is the sum of the original value and the increase in value.

x = $80,000 + $50,000 + (150% of $80,000 - $50,000)
x = $80,000 + $50,000 + (150% of $80,000 - $50,000)
x = $80,000 + $50,000 + ($120,000 - $50,000)
x = $80,000 + $50,000 + $70,000
x = $200,000

Alternatively, we can calculate the selling price by adding the cost of repairs to the new value of the house after repairs.

New value after repairs = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000
Selling price = $200,000

Now, we subtract the total cost from the selling price to find the profit.

Profit = Selling price - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed required is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount required: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep.
Total number of sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla already downloaded 80 GB before the restart, so she doesn't need to download that part again. But since she has to restart from the beginning, we can't subtract the 80 GB from the total. Instead, we add the time it took to download the 80 GB before the restart (40 minutes) and the 20 minutes it took for the restart, to the time it takes to download the entire file (100 minutes).

Total time = 40 minutes (before restart) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (download the entire file) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he initially drove away from home.

Distance driven away from home = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered during the 4 hours while trying to get home:
- The first 2 hours were spent in standstill traffic, so the distance covered is 0 miles.
- The next half-hour (0.5 hours) was spent driving at 30 mph, so the distance covered is 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- The remaining time is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, spent driving at 80 mph, so the distance covered is 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Total distance covered during the 4 hours = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Now, subtract the distance covered from the initial distance driven away from home:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

For the first 40 hours, Eliza's regular pay is $10 per hour. So, her regular pay is:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Since Eliza worked 45 hours, she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40 = 5). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime pay is:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first 5 years. However, in the 6th year, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108), but in the next year, the total revenue will be $73.50 ($63 + $10.50), which is still less than the total cost ($111). In the 8th year, the total revenue will be $84 ($73.50 + $10.50), which is still less than the total cost ($114). In the 9th year, the total revenue will be $94.50 ($84 + $10.50), which is still less than the total cost ($117). In the 10th year, the total revenue will be $105 ($94.50 + $10.50), which is still less than the total cost ($120). In the 11th year, the total revenue will be $115.50 ($105 + $10.50), which is more than the total cost ($123).

However, we can calculate the break-even point more efficiently by using a formula. The break-even point is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let x be the number of years. The total cost is $90 + $3x, and the total revenue is $10.50x.

We can set up the equation: $10.50x = $90 + $3x

Subtracting $3x from both sides: $7.50x = $90

Dividing both sides by $7.50: x = 12

However, this is the break-even point, and we want to know when Carlos will start earning money. So, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat: 84 / 12 = 7.

Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to walk the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11 lego sets.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets.

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week. 

He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) the other two days. So, the total time he spends running is:
3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we first need to determine her running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

One-third of six hours is 6 / 3 = 2 hours, and two-thirds of six hours is 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours.

Distance = speed * time. 
Distance covered while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

Total distance covered = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find the distance outside of the flames that she can stand and still hit the dragon.

1200 - 1000 = 200

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams are in one serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the grams per serving by the number of servings you can eat.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes she had left is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units:
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then find out how many dozens that is. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7.

Eggs per day: 252
Eggs per week: 252 * 7 = 1764

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs that is. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs per week by 12.

Dozens per week: 1764 / 12 = 147

Now that we know Lloyd sells 147 dozen eggs per week, we can multiply this by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per week.

Price per dozen: $2
Weekly earnings: 147 * $2 = $294

"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Distance = Speed * Time. 
Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles, and Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. 
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The remaining weight capacity of the bridge is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 more and got 23 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had is:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, let's subtract the stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find their combined weights, we first need to find Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) is 22.

However, we are not given any information about the number of games they drew. To solve this problem, we will assume that the team either won or lost all the games (i.e., there were no draws).

We are given that the team won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as:

W = L + 8

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:

W + L = 22

Substituting W = L + 8 into the second equation, we get:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

Her initial monthly salary is $600. A 10% increase would be 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we will have to calculate the increase for each year.

Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 2: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 3: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Now, we need to calculate her annual salary after three more years of service. Since her monthly salary is $878.46, her annual salary would be 12 * $878.46 = $10,541.52.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Now, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16, which gives us 4. This means Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used. 4 * 3 = 12.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also has a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (either Saturday or Sunday, but not both, since he has soda with dinner on the other day), so we add 1 more glass of water. This makes a total of 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes. 90 / 30 = 3.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies, so before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, Henry actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up an equation to find the number of cookies he baked last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year 'x'. Then, 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we need to know how many 20-foot intervals fit into the total time it took her to reach the shore (64 seconds). 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can divide the total time (64 seconds) by the time it took to row 20 feet (16 seconds) to find the number of 20-foot intervals: 
64 seconds / 16 seconds = 4 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the distance per interval (20 feet) to find the total distance:
4 intervals * 20 feet/interval = 80 feet

We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total amount of water taken on, we need to divide the total distance by 10 feet and multiply by 2 liters:

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = x + (0.3 * x)
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume her salary also increased by some percentage. However, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase for Lylah. To find the total salary, we will assume the same percentage increase for Lylah as for Adrien, which is 40%.

New Lylah's salary = Old Lylah's salary + (40% of old Lylah's salary)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New Lylah's salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her run into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the total: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons Julia had, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had before her husband bought the spoons.

7 (spoons Julia had before husband's purchase) + 3 (spoons used) = 10 spoons

Therefore, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to first calculate the total time spent by the doctors and then the total cost to the hospital and the total revenue from the patients.

Total patients per day: 500
Average time per patient: 24 minutes
Total time spent by doctors per day: 500 * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Cost to the hospital per hour: $150
Total cost to the hospital per day: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Revenue from patients per hour: $200
Total revenue from patients per day: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Profit made by the hospital per day: Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To find the initial number of french fries, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. Before that, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole 2/3x, and 1/3x remained. Since the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5, we can set up the equation:

1/3x - 1 = 5
1/3x = 6
x = 18

So, before the raccoon stole some fries, there were 18 fries. 

Before the raccoon, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Let's call the number of fries before the pigeons ate 'y'. Then, the pigeons ate 9, and 18 remained. We can set up the equation:

y - 9 = 18
y = 27

So, before the pigeons ate, there were 27 fries.

Before the pigeons, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Let's call the number of fries before the seagull ate 'z'. Then, the seagull ate 7, and 27 remained (including the 9 eaten by the pigeons, the 2/3x eaten by the raccoon, the 1 eaten by the ants, and the 5 left behind). We can set up the equation:

z - 7 = 27 + 9 + 1 + 5 (the 5 left behind and the 1 eaten by the ants and the 9 eaten by the pigeons and the 2/3x eaten by the raccoon which is 2/3 * 18 = 12)
z - 7 = 27 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 12 - 12 (since 12 is 2/3 * 18 and we already know that 18 is the number of fries before the raccoon)
z - 7 = 27 + 9 + 1 + 5
z - 7 = 42
z = 49

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 49 + 14 (the 14 eaten by Dave) = 63.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months. 

The price increase every 2 months is 20% of the original price, which is 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.

Since the price increase is added to the original price, the new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

However, for the next 2 months, the price increase will be 20% of the new price ($24), not the original price. So, we need to calculate the price increase for each 2-month period.

After 2 months: $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total profit and then work backwards to find the total cost of lemons.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Let's say they made x gallons of lemonade. Their total revenue would be $10x.

Their total cost per gallon is $3 (for lemons) + $2 (for sugar) = $5 per gallon. So, their total cost would be $5x.

Their profit is the difference between their total revenue and total cost, which is $10x - $5x = $5x.

We know their profit is $25, so we can set up the equation $5x = $25.

Solving for x, we get x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Their total cost of lemons is $3 per gallon * 5 gallons = $15.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years. Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Since Mark was 19 years old two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is:

P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together:

P(two even numbers) = P(even) × P(even) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities:

Difference = P(>3) - P(two even numbers) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage difference = 0.25 × 100 = 25%

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
Total slices for lunch = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
Total slices for breakfast = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Total slices of cheese used = Total slices for lunch + Total slices for breakfast + Total slices for dinner
Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices
Total slices of cheese used = 31 slices

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. 

Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of 5 tests. The desired average is 93, so the total score for 5 tests should be 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since she can remove the lowest score (71), we subtract it from the total: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the score of the sixth test (x) to 367 and set it equal to the total score needed (465): 367 + x = 465.

To find x, we subtract 367 from both sides: x = 465 - 367.

x = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. 
Distance covered in a week = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers
Distance covered in 4 weeks = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.
Distance covered in a week = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers
Distance covered in 3 weeks = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is 240 cups (20 * 12), we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240 to find the cost of each cup: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens: w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information: 
2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
64 - 16 = 4x - 2x
48 = 2x
x = 24

Since x represents the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes. 
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type

x = 3

So, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Her weekly consumption would be:

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend would be:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine:

Then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

Since Griffin had 27 fries in the end, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish)

Simplifying the equation: 
4 * (number of fish in each aquarium) = 28

Divide both sides by 4: 
number of fish in each aquarium = 28 / 4
number of fish in each aquarium = 7

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and multiply it by the hourly rate, then apply the discount.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for the entire movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake ingredients, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 
Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories

The difference in calories consumed is: 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. The total number of girls is also 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both days.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the animals he killed on both days:
Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
Total animals: 25 + 48 = 73

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as the problem states 20 stalls in the second part). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the total number of dozens. 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed. 5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour.

Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of the flagstones, the answer is:

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes worked by 10: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 * $5 = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then add the extra points.

Mike has 21 points after the third round. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

Mike's new total is 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim's total remains 18 points.
Tony's new total is 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

Total on the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total on the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total number of activities from both days:
170 (first day) + 200 (second day) = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day:
Distance to work = 30 miles
Since John goes to work and back, the total miles driven per day = 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles

Now, let's calculate the total miles driven per year:
Total miles driven per day = 60 miles
Number of days worked per week = 5 days
Number of weeks worked per year = 50 weeks
Total miles driven per year = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven per year = 15,000 miles
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:
Bonus per month = $150
Number of months in a year = 12
Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year including the bonus:
Total cost of driving per year = $30,000
Total bonus per year = $1,800
Total cost of driving per year including bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
Total time on Sunday and Monday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.
Time on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the pages are paired in a way that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

This arrangement still results in 16 pieces of paper, but the pages are paired differently.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books and that she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.
His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month is his monthly earnings from his hourly wage plus the total bonus. His monthly earnings from his hourly wage is $500 * 4 = $2000.
So, his total earnings for the month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find out how many loaves are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4

The original price of 1 tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings from 1 tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. 
Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on 1 packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6.

6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved
Amount available for gifts = $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to determine how many new records each person got on average, and then work backwards.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can divide 7 new records by 5 people to get the average number of new records per person. 

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we can multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to get the average number of old records per person.

1.4 new records per person * 2 old records per new record = 2.8 old records per person

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we don't know how many of the remaining employees are programmers. Let's assume the remaining employees (100 - 40 = 60) include both senior programmers and non-programmers. 

We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

However, we still need to find the number of senior programmers. Since we don't have the exact number of senior programmers, let's assume all 60 remaining employees are senior programmers for the sake of calculation.

Now, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the money paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40%:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, we can calculate the rewards they earned as follows:
$80 / $20 = 4
So, they earned 4 rewards of $1 each, totaling $4 in rewards.

Now, let's calculate the total discount they got on this shopping trip:
Rewards: $4
Coupon: The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so it's 2 * $4 = $8
Total discount: $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. Applying the total discount of $12, we get:
$43 - $12 = $31

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes: $30,000/year * 20% = $6,000/year
Net income: $30,000/year - $6,000/year = $24,000/year

Job B:
Gross income: $42,000/year
Property tax: $6,000/year
Net income before tax: $42,000/year - $6,000/year = $36,000/year
Taxes: $36,000/year * 10% = $3,600/year
Net income: $36,000/year - $3,600/year = $32,400/year

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to calculate the difference between the two jobs:
$32,400/year - $24,000/year = $8,400/year

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider RJ and Richard as the same person with 1 gun (we'll ignore the 5 guns mentioned for Richard to avoid duplication).

So, the total number of guns is: 
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard) = 19 guns

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price increase and decrease over the two years.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase).
New price = $8 * 1.5 = $12 per share.

The total value after the first year is 8 shares * $12 per share = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease).
New price = $12 * 0.75 = $9 per share.

The final value of all Maria's shares is 8 shares * $9 per share = $72.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we know that the smallest group has 'x - 10' students. So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To find the total number of legs, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. The number of chickens will then be '2x'.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent, so we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50

Total number of tennis shoes sold: 50"
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

- Tuesdays: 1 hour
- Thursdays: 2 hours
- Saturdays: Since Saturday's practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, it was 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 hour (Tuesdays) + 2 hours (Thursdays) + 2 hours (Saturdays) = 5 hours.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment is faulty, so the amount spent on faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent.

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

A dozen is equal to 12. Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls and gave one to each of her 6 children. So, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 
6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to break down the information given.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we are left with 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who do not like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 would be 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. Since 5 pupils like green, the remaining pupils would be 20 - 5 = 15 pupils who like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples she picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, she also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.1
Time (T) = 5 months = 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount ≈ $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is 'x'. So, Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find out how many popsicles each of them has:
Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours, 
7200 watt-hours/day = 7.2 kWh/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the original usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day
2700 watt-hours/day = 2.7 kWh/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the reduced usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that will explode) have this defect.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of the number of candles that will explode
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.30 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount 
= $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * 4 
= $14 * 4 
= $56

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both sisters is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since Joanne's sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is the number gathered by Joanne.

The answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation: 
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write another equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting 'c' into the first equation:
d = 180 - c
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled on that day is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's elevation of 10,000 feet, so the elevation of the comb is:
10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of the comb, he needs to climb:
6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months. However, we only need 8 months of this rate, so:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, but we only need the remaining months after the introductory and normal rate periods, which is indeed 10 months:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.

6 minibuses can hold 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibuses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.

10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day by adding the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders.

Total birds = 90 (homemade) + 60 (store-bought) = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then:

Number of cards sold = 2/3 * x
100 = 2/3 * x

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order before the discount, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply 3/4 by 8.

3/4 * 8 = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)) to find the perimeter.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is:
40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James' bike ride time is:

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

The answer is: 2"
"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes has 2 shoes, we'll convert the pairs to individual shoes:
- 5 pairs on Monday = 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
- 15 pairs on Wednesday = 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday = 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

Now, let's add the shoes he received:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately, then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood, he gets 200 sticks for $4. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood, he gets 400 sticks for $6. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar, we will use this to calculate the total number of sticks. 

With $24, Frederick can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. 

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 dogs * 2 pairs per dog = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Total cost: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. However, the cost is given per pack, so the total cost is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Total revenue: Tara sold the bags for $8 each. She sold 40 bags, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. 
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find the amount he gave to his sister, and finally determine the amount he spent on dinner.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:

4x = 4(20) = 80

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total miles walked per day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles per day.

Now, we multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days he works in a week, which is 5 days. 
6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James has 80 toys, so five times that amount is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

However, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this amount. This means the number of toys he currently has plus 2 is equal to 400. 

Let's represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. Then, x + 2 = 400. 

To find 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total amount Daniel has to spend, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
The discount amount is 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total amount Daniel has to spend after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission. 
Commission for the first $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the amount over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission.
Commission for the amount over $1000 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000
Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150
Total commission earned by Antonella = $450

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, we multiply 70 by 2.

70 guests * 2 bottles per guest = 140 bottles

Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so we multiply 2 by 24 to find out how many bottles he already has.

2 cases * 24 bottles per case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he wants.

140 bottles (wanted) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we can't directly calculate the time for a hot day. But we can assume that the time for a hot day is the same as for a warm day, as the problem doesn't provide any other information.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles. On a hot day, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from Juan's current coffee intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since James has 2 sons, and we know their ages, we can assume he wants to buy candles equal to their ages. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which makes him 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total. Since the candles come in packs of 5, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now that we know James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 140 pages / 1.5 * 1.5 = 140 / 1.5 * 1 = 140 / 1.5 = 93.33 pages, which we can round to 93 pages (rounding down since you can't read a fraction of a page).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 93 + 100 = 193 pages.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then find the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up the equation: 
51 = 3 * nephew's age in 7 years

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Now, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from the nephew's age in 7 years:

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories she burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit, which is 100 ml. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to first find his final typing speed after the second increase. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his typing speed is 52 WPM. 
After the second increase of 5 WPM, his typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements by adding them together and dividing by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight between the two options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is:
100 (initial invitees) + 100 * 2 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, let's consider the people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, as she will also be attending the event. So, the total number of seats needed is:
318 (total attendees) + 1 (Alex) = 319

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first. 

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. 
The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 
The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. 
The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8. The total cost on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two options. The difference is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

"To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to track the height of the beanstalk each day.

Day 1: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles to 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles to 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles to 32 feet tall.

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk will be taller than the window on the 4th day.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the angles.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to calculate the weight after the 50% increase and then subtract 2 pounds.

First, we calculate the 50% increase: 8 pounds * 0.5 = 4 pounds. 
Now, we add the 50% increase to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal uses a weight 2 pounds lighter: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours:
120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production rate:
(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours) to find their total production:
Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:
720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Joe has $50, and he spends $42 on the outfit. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the outfit from his initial amount: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants he plans to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week (7 days), we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4.

28 * 1/4 = 28 * 0.25 = 7

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make these croissants.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 

The cost per month for the additional months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

The cost per month for the additional months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The total cost for the additional months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

The total number of seats in the auditorium is 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats are 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, which is 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats.

The seats occupied by students are the remaining seats after subtracting the seats occupied by administrators and parents, which is 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between that and Adam's current height.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find the difference, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit from selling each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are:

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference between their speeds, since they are moving in the same direction. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary. 

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

However, the bonus is only given once a year, so we need to calculate the total yearly income by adding the bonus to 12 times the new monthly salary.

Total yearly income = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500 = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs is 4s + 2g. We are given that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:

4s + 2g = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

s + g = 20

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for 's' by first multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:

2s + 2g = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':

(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 15

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation 2T + 3t = 44, we get 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding this, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet (t = 6), we can find the age of one twin (T = t + 7). So, T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years, we first need to calculate how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to calculate 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8.

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in a year, he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in a year, he saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

Now, let's calculate how many coins each of them saves in 10 years.

Rong saves 240 coins per year, so in 10 years, he saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 336 coins per year, so in 10 years, he saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

The total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is $100 * 0.6 = $60.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

First, we know the cost of an apple is $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Total chairs currently available = 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs required. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

However, since there are only 8 high chairs available, Mia will need 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42, but she already has 40, so she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find Gary's truck capacity by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity. 

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they still need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raised per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 2 hours by 24 (since 48 hours / 2 hours = 24).

Quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 100 quarts/2 hours * 24 = 100 * 24 = 1200 quarts

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 4 hours by 12 (since 48 hours / 4 hours = 12).

Quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/4 hours * 12 = 50 * 12 = 600 quarts

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get: 9x = 90.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get: x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to find the total number of blue spools and divide it by the total number of spools, then multiply by 100.

Total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 + 45
Total blue spools = 60

Total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores.
6 adults want 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores.
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed.
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages. 

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate it as 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total voters - Total votes received by candidates A and B

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For the giant cubes, Peter uses 4 ounces per cube and makes 3 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For the medium cubes, Peter uses 2 ounces per cube and makes 7 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For the small cubes, Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube and makes 8 cubes, so the total amount of water used is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

$5 - $2 = $3

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group and then the total number of groups required for 54 students.

Since the activity initially requires the students to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide 54 students by 6 groups to find the number of students per group: 
54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group.

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students that can be accommodated in 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups:
9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students.

However, we are only concerned with the 54 students. Since the number of students per group remains the same (9 students per group), we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find the total number of groups required for 54 students:
54 students / 9 students per group = 6 groups.

The activity requires 12 groups, but only 6 groups are needed for 54 students. Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is the difference between the required groups and the actual groups needed:

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from his total goal to find out how much he needs to make from selling corn. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn.

$75 / 25 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total hours she has available and the hours she spends on other activities.

Total hours available: 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Hours spent reading: 3 hours

Remaining hours after reading: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Hours spent playing video games: 1/3 of 9 hours = 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours

Hours spent playing soccer: 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Hours spent playing soccer / Total hours) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the number of pencils he gave away to Brandon and Charlie.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost of series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5. Let's calculate the number of older movies:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10. Let's calculate the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
Total cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add the cost of all the movies:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

The final answer is: $3534"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30z
Points from time for Ava: 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between Ava's total points and Emma's total points:
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = -25

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the days they ride twice as much.

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

On the days they ride twice as much (2 days), they ride twice the usual number of rides, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the days they ride twice as much:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Since there are two people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of rides by 2:
27 rides * 2 = 54 rides

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish as 'o'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write an equation: w + o = 17.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the total number of white fish after adding the new fish as 'W' and the total number of orange fish as 'O'. We know that W = 4 + w and O = 3 + o.

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, we can write the equation: O = 2W. Substituting the expressions for O and W, we get: 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + o = 8 + 2w. Rearranging the terms, we get: o - 2w = 5.

Now we have two equations: w + o = 17 and o - 2w = 5. We can solve these equations simultaneously. Rearranging the second equation, we get: o = 2w + 5. Substituting this expression for o in the first equation, we get: w + (2w + 5) = 17.

Combine like terms: 3w + 5 = 17. Subtract 5 from both sides: 3w = 12. Divide by 3: w = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses. 

Since the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

He drives to work from Monday to Friday, so the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 twenties is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. 
Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters, and she spent all of them. 
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount spent from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, let's add the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = $120 + $35 = $155.

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

However, Dale sold 150 candies before ordering the additional 100. This means he still has the 100 he initially ordered plus the 100 he ordered later, minus the 150 he sold. But since he sold 150 and only had 100 initially, he must have sold 50 of the 100 he ordered later.

So, the correct calculation is: 
- He initially had 100 and sold 100, so he had 0 of the initial 100 left.
- Then he ordered 100 more and sold 50 of those, so he has 100 - 50 = 50 of the second 100 left.

In total, Dale has 0 (from the first 100) + 50 (from the second 100) = 50 candies left to sell.

The answer is: 50"
"To find the number of additional students by the end of May, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the number of marshmallows used and dropped from the total: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and they want to divide them equally between the two kids, we divide 14 by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

So each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, let's add up the total amount of ingredients: 
- Citrus zest: z
- Fragrance: z
- Salt: 2z
- Sugar: 2z
- Oil: 4z

Total amount = z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z

Since the total amount is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation: 
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
z = 1

Now that we know z is 1, we can find the amount of oil:
Oil = 4z
Oil = 4 * 1
Oil = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has: 3x = 3 * 47 = 141.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the turtles will take twice as long as a kangaroo to travel the same distance.

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

The difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine the number of trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30). 

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray ($2.5) to find the total earnings.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to first determine the total number of pairs James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs is:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

We know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms, one-half of the rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in addition to the previous 48 homes. So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

Total homes built = 12 + 36 + 96
Total homes built = 144

"Let's denote my age as 'I', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as: 
I = B - 3

I am 2 years older than my sister, so we can express this as: 
I = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as 'M'. 
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. 
I + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for I and M into the equation: 
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms: 
6B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides: 
6B = 96

Divide by 6: 
B = 16

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age: 
I = B - 3
I = 16 - 3
I = 13

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are required. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / Glue sticks per pack
= 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack
= 6.75 packs

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water after the increase on the first day and then add the increase on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add this increase to the amount on the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river at that point: 14000"

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers: 40
Tip per customer: $20
Total tips for Rafaela: 40 * $20 = $800

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply her total tips by 0.1.

10% of Rafaela's tips: $800 * 0.1 = $80

Now, we subtract 10% of Rafaela's tips from her total to find Julieta's total tips.

Julieta's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals.

Total tips: $800 + $720 = $1520

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between Wendy's and Amber's badges: 36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40

"To find out how many books Fawn has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F.

We know that:
1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third one. First, let's express A in terms of F from the second equation:
A = F - 12

Now, let's express S in terms of A from the first equation and then substitute A with F - 12:
S = A + 25
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now, let's substitute S and A in the third equation:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine like terms:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. In the first week, she made $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) = $24. In the following week, she made $6 (Joe) + $30 (Alba) = $36. However, we don't know if she mowed Joe's lawn in both weeks. If she did, the total would be $24 + $36 = $60. If she only mowed Joe's lawn once, the total would be $24 + $30 = $54.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact amount she made from mowing lawns, we'll consider both scenarios. If she made $60 from mowing lawns, she made $80 - $60 = $20 from lemonade sales. If she made $54 from mowing lawns, she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.

However, we can't provide two answers. We'll assume she mowed Joe's lawn once, which is the most conservative assumption.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly earnings from renting the car and subtract his car payment.

John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours rented per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total monthly earnings from renting the car is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, let's subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles. 
So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance.
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5 sets. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, the total material needed for the small masks is 5 sets * 2 yards/set = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets (round up to 3 sets since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the exact amount needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, the total material needed for the large masks is 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John).

We are also given that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

We can substitute L = J + 10 into the equation P = L + J to get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Now, we can substitute P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into the equation P + L + J = 100 to get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

The total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43200 * 6 = $259200.
The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32400 * 6 = $194400.

The difference in revenue is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's amount) = 10 pounds
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we first need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining money is:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining money is:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining money is:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

Finally, we can calculate how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with his remaining money:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15, which is 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she spent sleeping and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the extra 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since she woke up 5 minutes early, she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. 

First, let's convert the time to minutes:
- 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.
- Since she woke up 5 minutes early, she slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spent sleepwalking:
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes at the end of the third day.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by the three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the initial distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the south direction and subtract the distance traveled in the north direction to find the net distance:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then calculate their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, we subtract 5 years from their ages at that time to find their current ages.

Emil's dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
Emil's brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught and then divide it by the weight of one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members
= 6 + 6

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches per foot.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants.

1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because we can't have a partial plant, and we already have 17 plants). However, we need to subtract the 17 plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.

44 - 17 = 27

Now, we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost per plant.

27 * $6 = $162

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines for each basket, then multiply by the number of baskets.

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / 1 pound/rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights to Greece. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

These remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. So the total amount collected from these sources is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

Three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total number of slices represents the whole watermelon, we can set up a proportion to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:

Adult's slice / Total watermelon = 2x / 8x

To find the percentage, we can divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:

Let x be the charge at the beginning of the 3 hours.
x - 3 * 7% = 28%
x - 0.21x = 0.28
0.79x = 0.28
x = 0.28 / 0.79
x = 0.354 or 35.4%

Now, let's calculate the charge at the beginning of the 5 hours, when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.

Let y be the charge at the beginning of the 5 hours.
y - 5 * 9% = 35.4%
y - 0.45y = 0.354

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18
Total number of portraits and selfies = 45

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many minutes it takes him to read one page and then multiply that by the total number of pages he read.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to read one page, we divide 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read:

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests left is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:
76 + 30 = 106

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests is:
106 + 7 = 113

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total to find the number of average and difficult questions. 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Half of 18 is 9, so she will get 9 average questions and 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get $4 * 2L = $8 * L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: $12 * L + $8 * L = $120. Combining like terms, we get $20 * L = $120.

Dividing both sides by $20, we get L = 6. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this value to get S = 2 * 6 = 12.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week is:
11 sandwiches per day * 7 days per week = 77 sandwiches per week

"To find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, we need to find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the first two packages and then apply that to the third package.

For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be $1.50. 

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance that the whole class will get an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (50% * 60% = 30%), there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, but giving Marcus a personal extension is 30% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with class extension) + 6% (normal teacher with personal extension) = 76%.

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 more bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we multiply the number of moves by the time per move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Total apples = 2 * 40
Total apples = 80

Now, we know Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both amounts separately.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate the number of years it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the new length and width.

Area of one piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we'll subtract that from the total losses.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know 'x' (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food they eat per day (360 grams). 

720 / 360 = 2

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

Total slices in 4 pizzas = 4 * 8 = 32 slices. Since they can't eat more than the total number of slices, we know that they ate all the slices.

However, the question asks for the total number of slices they ate, not the total number of slices in the pizzas. Since Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate all the slices, the total number of slices they ate is indeed 31, but this is not possible as there are 32 slices in total. The only explanation is that the question is asking for the total number of slices they ate, and they ate all the slices, so the total number of slices they ate is indeed 32.

"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, let's denote Donovan's time as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken for the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's time, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's time is 'x + 18', we can now find Betsy's time:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18
Betsy's time = 58

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a day, we first need to calculate the number of emails that don't require a response. 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 
64 * 5 = 320

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.7 = 14
Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Total number of pizzas left = 6 (from the glee club) + 8 (from the football team) = 14

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of small coupons and big coupons:
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
Total cost in dollars = 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of successful trucks by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying:

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then determine the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of people invited is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract them from the total:
45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee covers 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests:
41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21

The additional cost for these 21 guests is:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the daily consumption.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total time it took James to reach the store by dividing the total distance by his walking speed (4 miles per hour).

Growth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years.

300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:

"To find the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours per week in class.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on each Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on each Saturday and Sunday. Since there are 2 weekend days, he spends 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes on extra learning time per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours per week on extra learning time.

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the initial weight. Therefore, the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas in total.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother) and 6 are unshaken.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the people who arrived in cars and buses were the ones inside the church. However, we also need to include the bride and groom, Mary and John, who were also inside the church.

Total number of people inside the church: 480 people + 2 people (Mary and John) = 482 people

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in time:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks, so the total time for breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for his lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunches and breaks. 

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then subtract the returned amount from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discount.

Frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 (discount)
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 (discount)
Set of towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance on credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under the UV light, and these are a third of the large jellyfish. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3.

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can find the total number of jellyfish by multiplying 18 by 5.

18 * 5 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 * $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her desired annual retirement income for 20 years. We'll also assume she doesn't expect any returns on her savings.

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 * $100,000
= $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can say she needs to work for 40 years in total to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she has already worked for some years, let's assume she has worked for 'x' years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we do not have the value of 'x', we will assume she has just started working and provide the answer as 40 years.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the given percentage and number of boys. 

First, we know that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240
0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract her planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles per day she must hike: 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5."

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 
The two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional production after the 10-hour shift will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, we know that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation as x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together all four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. 

So, Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes (given)
2 / x = 40
x = 2 / 40 = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20) miles/minute

"To find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles, we first need to find out how many marbles he has initially. 

We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 * 12 = 24. 

Let's say Bob initially has 'x' marbles. If he receives 24 more marbles, he will have x + 24 marbles. According to the problem, x + 24 = 60. 

To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24 = 36.

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets per year and then multiply it by the number of years in a decade.

Number of lemons per year = Number of trees * Number of lemons per tree per year

= 30 lemons/year

Number of years in a decade = 10 years

Total number of lemons in a decade = Number of lemons per year * Number of years
= 30 lemons/year * 10 years
= 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by the total parts in the ratio (14) to find the value of one part. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women.

Initial number of women = 6 * 9 = 54

20 women alight from the bus, so we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who remained.

Number of women who remained = 54 - 20 = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 to invest in the rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total investment by the cost per rock:

$100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks sold

He sells each rock for $7. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 rocks * $7 per rock = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$100 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. To draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. To draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. To draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day, we need to find the most efficient way to complete the project. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. However, this is not the correct answer because it is the LCM of the days, not the actual days it will take to complete the project.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of each type of picture scene by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.

However, the most efficient way to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of each type of picture scene by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day and then adding the results.

9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days.

However, this is not the correct answer because Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days.

The correct answer is the maximum of the days it will take to complete each type of picture scene.

Now, to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required amount:

Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

"To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

He sold half of the land (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

The total amount of money he earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses per day and then multiply it by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks he uses per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Since we want to know how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to first determine the total number of eggs hidden and then subtract the number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by the children: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply that by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, his weekly earnings are 1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $.40/collection = 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total production for 10 years:
- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0
- Year 10: 1000

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can set up the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

And the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple. 

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining half is 6 pints, which is divided among red, white, and purple.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3. 

6 / 3 = 2 pints of red paint.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods you get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20.
$1000 / $20 = 50

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5.
$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk. 
20% of the original 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the chalk until it is 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk that can be used before it needs to be recycled.

Now, we can divide the remaining usable chalk (0.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days before the chalk needs to be recycled, so we round up to the nearest whole number. 
0.75 days is less than 1 day, but since the teacher can use the chalk for part of the day, we round up to 1 day and add the 2 days from the 2.75 days calculated earlier.

The teacher has 2 + 1 = 3 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk, but on the third day, he will have to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the teacher has 3 days, but the chalk will be recycled on the third day.

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
$27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15: 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs per minute. To do this, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take:

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and 75 of those came from the third day's order. This means they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left from the first day.

However, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the first two days. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

Since they had 12 bandages left from the first day, they must have had 31 - 12 = 19 bandages at the start of the first day, in addition to the 50 they ordered.

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there were 4 people in total. 

To find out how much root beer was available for each person, we divide the remaining amount of root beer (8 gallons) by the total number of people (4).

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

Total number of fish = 66
Number of fish with red stripes = 66 * (1/3) = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes.

Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * Remaining fish
= 5/11 * 44
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she initially had and subtract the colors she lost.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which is 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors. So, the total number of colors she initially had is 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy lost 4 colors.

Amy also used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school:

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount he owes is the sum of the borrowed amount and the interest.
Total amount = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the difference between the total amount and the amount paid in 11 months.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then the number of red jelly beans he estimated.

The volume of the jar is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans in the jar is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans he estimated is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 5 * 3 * 2 = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next 3 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 3 * 3 * 5 = $45

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying it by 4:

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100.

$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks per bag to find the cost per stick.

Number of sticks per bag: 30
Cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110 questions: 
70% * 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is: 
60% * 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs 77 questions correct in total and she got 42 questions right on the first test, we subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed: 
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it can be represented as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can set up the equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5s - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There is a flashlight for every person (4 people) and two for each room (8 rooms). 
Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 2 * 8 (for rooms) = 4 + 16 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 
Half the rooms = 8 / 2 = 4 rooms
Total small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Total medium candles = 5 * 4 = 20
Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

Now, let's combine the total number of candles and flashlights.
Total candles and flashlights = 36 (candles) + 20 (flashlights) = 56

Total chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total chips / Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 chips / 5 members
Chips per person = 22 chips

The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he works in a week. 

Since Tim spends 6 hours each day at work, the total hours he works in a week is 6 hours/day * 5 days = 30 hours.

Now, we need to convert the total hours into minutes, as it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total minutes he works in a week is 30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls he deals with in a week by dividing the total minutes he works by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

Total calls = Total minutes / Time per call
Total calls = 1800 minutes / 15 minutes
Total calls = 120

Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen seeds would be 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18 seeds. Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, to find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine the number of pens Timothy owns. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find out how many pens Sarah has, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to first find Anne's height and then Jackie's current height.

Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we multiply Albert's height by 2 to get Anne's height:
Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we subtract 2"" from Anne's height to get Jackie's current height:
Jackie's current height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before summer:
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces:
5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

In two weeks, the company will produce:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The company sells each bar for $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks is:
70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second one costs 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying ice cream cones.

Ryan's allowance for 3 weeks is $6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 cones at $1.25 each. The total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets. Each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we'll divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To calculate the profit, we need to find the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue.

The cost of making 1 jar is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of special honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The total cost of making 10 jars: 10 * $44 = $440

The total revenue from selling 10 jars: 10 * $50 = $500

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $500 - $440 = $60

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works in 2 weeks and the total number of cars he services.

Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially, subtract the cookies he ate and gave away, and then add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

Randy ate:
- 3 cookies (1 of each flavor) for an early day snack
- 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch

Total cookies eaten = 3 + 2 = 5 cookies

Randy gave away:
- 2 sugar cookies

Total cookies given away = 2 cookies

Now, let's subtract the cookies eaten and given away from the initial total:
18 (initial cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) - 2 (cookies given away) = 11 cookies

Randy then baked:
- 4 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

Total cookies baked = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies

Now, let's add the cookies baked to the remaining cookies:

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day. 

The number of days it takes to fill in all the holes is 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's average enrollment as follows:

Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

Difference in average enrollment = Norman High School's average enrollment - Butler High School's average enrollment
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to first determine how many items Igor gathered. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He gathered the correct number of beakers, but we don't know how many he lost yet, so we'll call the number of beakers he gathered 'x'. We know he was supposed to gather 7 beakers.

We know the total number of items Igor gathered is 29. So we can set up the equation: 
8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants: 
24 + x = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides: 
x = 5

Since Igor gathered 5 beakers, but was supposed to gather 7, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can calculate the distance Aaron ran as follows:

Distance Aaron ran = Distance Vanessa ran / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile as follows:

Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = Total time / Total miles
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles
Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 8 minutes

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile is twice the time it takes Aaron:

Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * 8 minutes
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles:

Total time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile * Total miles
Total time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = 16 minutes * 4
Total time Vanessa takes to run 4 miles = 64 minutes

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, we find John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the radiator cost and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
