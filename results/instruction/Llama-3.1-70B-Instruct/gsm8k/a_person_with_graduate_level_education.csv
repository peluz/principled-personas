"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells:
Total eggs laid: 16
Eggs used: 7
Eggs sold: 16 - 7 = 9

Finally, let's calculate her daily earnings:
Eggs sold: 9
Price per egg: $2
Daily earnings: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Total bolts required = bolts of blue fiber + bolts of white fiber
Total bolts required = 2 + 1
Total bolts required = 3

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house after repairs and compare it to his total investment.

Josh's initial investment is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, we can calculate Josh's profit by subtracting his total investment from the selling price: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, each of 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

With 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 9 = 180 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the remaining 14 glasses into 7 pairs. Each pair consists of one glass at full price ($5) and one glass at 60% of the price ($3).

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 
The cost of 7 pairs is 7 * $8 = $56.

Adding the cost of the first two glasses ($5 + $3 = $8) to the cost of the remaining 14 glasses ($56), we get the total cost.

Total cost = $8 + $56 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in all three cities by adding the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial download before the restart and the download after the restart.

Initially, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update and the initial 40 minutes Carla spent downloading before the restart. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

In the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours), John drove at 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance covered in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 3 hours at 60 mph before turning around. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance covered in the 4 hours after turning around from the initial distance:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered in 4 hours = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the number of downloads in each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue exceeds the total cost in the 6th year.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
The remaining vacuum cleaners after these two sales would be x - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1.

Now, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This can be represented as (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) = 5. 
Simplifying this equation, we get (2x/3) - (x/3) - 2 + 1 = 5, which further simplifies to (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Adding 1 to both sides, we get x/3 = 6. 
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the expected value of each investment after the speculated market increase.

For the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% market increase:
Expected value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase percentage)
Expected value = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
Expected value = $5,000 + $125
Expected value = $5,125

Profit from jewelry = Expected value - Initial value
Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000
Profit from jewelry = $125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% market increase:
Expected value = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase percentage)
Expected value = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
Expected value = $8,000 + $96
Expected value = $8,096

Profit from electronic gadgets = Expected value - Initial value
Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000
Profit from electronic gadgets = $96

Comparing the profits from both options, the merchant can maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which yields a higher profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in both directions.

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points. Therefore, we can simply add the distances traveled in both directions.

Total distance = Distance traveled west + Distance traveled north
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

The total number of eggs she consumes in 4 weeks is 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and Marissa wants to complete it at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour), so she has 6 miles remaining. She has also already used 2 hours.

Time remaining = Total time - Time used
Time remaining = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time remaining = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we started with 10 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago son was born = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago son was born = 37 - 23
Years ago son was born = 14

We know that 75% of the original price is equal to $19.50. We can express this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11 lego sets.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's walking and running speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, if she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the distance outside the flames where she can still hit the dragon: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. The remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 articles is (2/5) * 5 = 2 articles. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

We are also given that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. So, the cost of a red tie is:
Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
Cost of a red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of a red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of a red tie = $60

Now, we can find the total cost of the red ties:
Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60
Total cost of red ties = $600

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
Total cost of ties = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
Total cost of ties = $200 + $600
Total cost of ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then determine the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Number of occupied units = (3/4) * Total number of units
= (3/4) * 120
= 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
= 120 - 90
= 30 units

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Finally, we multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue earned on Thursday is:
6 * $60 = $360 (truck tires)
4 * $40 = $160 (car tires)
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires. The total revenue earned on Friday is:
12 * $40 = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned higher revenue on Thursday. To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue earned on Friday from the revenue earned on Thursday:
$520 - $480 = $40

mpg = distance traveled / amount of gas consumed
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas:

After the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days. This is equivalent to 185 * 2 = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times the alarm rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

Since Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, she is eligible for the 10% increase. The increase amount is 10% of her initial monthly salary, which is $600 * 0.10 = $60. 

Her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year, we will apply the 10% increase to her new monthly salary for the next two years.

Year 1: $660 * 0.10 = $66 increase, new monthly salary = $660 + $66 = $726.
Year 2: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60 increase, new monthly salary = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.
Year 3: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86 increase, new monthly salary = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

To calculate her annual salary, we multiply her new monthly salary by 12.

Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the number of gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Expected attendees = Total invited guests * (1 - 1/4)
Expected attendees = 16 * (1 - 0.25)
Expected attendees = 16 * 0.75
Expected attendees = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Expected attendees * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 9

However, since Christina invited 16 friends and needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Total invited guests * 0.75
Total gift bags = 16 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12

The cost of the gift bags will be the total number of gift bags multiplied by the cost per gift bag:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
Total cost = 12 * 2
Total cost = 24

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults will eat 10 lbs each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount the adults will eat to the amount the children will eat: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age: 4"
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time = 38 seconds
Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time. 

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can express this as:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:

Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Now, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. We can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of canned tomatoes she started with. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce. 

Given that the sauce is 32 ounces, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Now, we know that each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total initial volume (64 ounces) by the volume of a single can (16 ounces). 

64 / 16 = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars that drove through - Number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she initially has is:
2 plants/window ledge * 40 window ledges = 80 plants

She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of plants she will give away is:
1 plant/window ledge * 40 window ledges = 40 plants

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. 

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) 
Total pages = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract those from the total pages to find the remaining pages.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15
Remaining pages = 24 pages

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has left to complete his reading (4 days) to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day.

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 / 4
Average pages per day = 6

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir by adding their individual cookie consumption:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time he spent watching TV.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

"To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas before the rewards. 

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cost of the gas is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon. Since the person is buying 10 gallons, the total cashback reward is:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of the gas to get the final cost:

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

The total number of roll-ups eaten by both is 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by 2 (the number of people eating).

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the distance she rows per second, we divide the distance by the time:
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can calculate the total distance she rowed:
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find the total amount of water taken on, we divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2:
Total water = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters
Total water = 8 * 2 liters
Total water = 16 liters

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we need to determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The total selling price for these boards is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. The total selling price for these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's initial salary, then calculate Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as L. Since Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's initial salary as 1.3L. We are given that Adrien's initial salary was $40000. 

So, 1.3L = 40000
L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30769.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is 1.4 times his initial salary:
Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we assume the same rate of increase for Lylah. However, the problem does not specify the rate of increase for Lylah. Assuming the same rate of increase (40%) for Lylah as for Adrien, we can calculate Lylah's new salary:
Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 43078 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamped 20 letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table was x + 5.

However, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons she had when setting the table was (x + 5) - 3.

We are given that the total number of spoons Julia had when setting the table was 12. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought was 10.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages and add it to the number of chicken sausages. 

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding the number of friends each of them made:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he is buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of each item:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day. The total time spent by the doctors is:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent by the doctors in hours is:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, and the total time spent by the doctors is 200 hours. However, this time is spread across 500 patients, so the average time spent per patient is 24 minutes or 0.4 hours. The total revenue generated from the patients is:
500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $40,000 - $30,000

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * 4 miles = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to get the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 miles - 28 miles

Total unicorns = 27
Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 1/3 * 27 = 9

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

Female unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 2/3 * 9 = 6

The cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost before the tip is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of bees is 700.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We can express the total number of bees in terms of Q:
W + B + Q = 700
Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation:
2B + B + Q = 700
2(2Q) + 2Q + Q = 700
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Now, we can solve for Q:
Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200
W = 2B = 2 * 200 = 400

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after 12 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still outside the hive.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, the total number of bees outside the hive is 15 (from the first 12 hours) + 60 (from the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means all 75 bees that were outside the hive return.

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to determine the number of 2-month periods and then apply the 20% increase for each period.

36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods

However, the price increase is based on the original price, not the new price after each increase. This is a key point to consider in this problem.

The correct way to calculate the price after each period is to add the 20% increase to the original price for each period. 

After 18 periods, the total increase would be 18 * $4 = $72.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months would be the original price plus the total increase.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is 15 * 3 = 45.

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session to find out how many times she needs to babysit. 

Number of babysitting sessions = Total number of eggs needed / Number of eggs per session
= 45 / 9
= 5

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the relationship S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

There are 5 weekdays in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, so the total miles walked on weekdays is:
5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles

There are 2 days in a weekend. Pancho walks 10 miles a day on weekends, so the total miles walked on weekends is:
2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. 
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated by adding the costs of the hat and jacket and dividing by 2. 
So, the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. 
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we first need to find out how much she pays each month. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. The total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. 50% of $1000 is 0.5 * $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment. $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly payment by 12. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

Their total revenue is $25 (profit) plus their total cost. Since we don't know the total cost yet, let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. 

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x. 

The revenue from 'x' gallons is 20x glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10x.

Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation: 
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5 gallons

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can calculate how much they spent on lemons:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the equation becomes:
200 = 5x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 5:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From statement 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

To use the information in statement 2, we need to find Jan's age two years ago. Since Jan is currently 30, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Now, we can use the information in statement 2: Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago (28) is 28 / 2 = 14. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From statement 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is 21, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To determine the total time for the well-rounded team, we multiply the time per runner (55 seconds) by the number of runners (4). 

Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds

For the less well-rounded team, we calculate the time for each runner and add them up. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (60 - 3), the third runner takes 54 seconds (57 - 3), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (54 - 3).

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

To find the difference in time, we subtract the total time of the well-rounded team from the total time of the less well-rounded team.

Difference in time = Total time for the less well-rounded team - Total time for the well-rounded team = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds

However, the question asks for how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is the faster team, we need to subtract the total time of the less well-rounded team from the total time of the well-rounded team and take the absolute value of the result, but in this case, the well-rounded team is faster by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then compare the two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. This also simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself, since the two rolls are independent events. This gives us (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, we can compare the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find the difference between the two probabilities, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 × 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since he starts with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees he has planted is 10 * 8 = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. The cost of each plate is $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is:

6 plates * $6000/plate = $36,000

Now, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:

$36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the total cost of buying each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

$34,800 / 240 cups = $145 per cup

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens is 4."
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Number of customers on the third day = Total number of customers by the third day - Total number of customers on the first two days
= 500 - 250
= 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16. 

We can set up the equation based on the given information: 
2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
64 - 16 = 4x - 2x
48 = 2x
x = 24

Since x represents the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt, and then divide that by her hourly wage.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes to find the remaining balance. 
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three in three years:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total cards now = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
Adding extra meat costs $2.00, extra cheese costs $1.00, avocado costs $1.00, and 2 sauces cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the additional items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 
The total cost of the burrito is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. 
Upgrading the meal costs an extra $3.00, so the total cost of the meal is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. 
Chad uses a $5.00 gift card, so he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to first determine their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her rate is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we can calculate the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

However, we also know that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. This means that the total weekly consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend is 42 tomatoes/week (Steve's consumption) + 21 tomatoes/week (his girlfriend's consumption, which is half of Steve's) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week: 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines.

"To find the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to calculate the initial investment and then multiply it by 3.

Johnny started with his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so the initial investment is:

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan. 

Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of the three girls: Jessa's age (20) + Joan's age (25) + Mary's age (23) = 68.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall. 30% of the students went out through exit A, which is:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

The remaining students after exit A is:

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we first need to determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2 * Robert's candies = 54

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James' candies can be calculated as:

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of books and the number of times each book is read.

Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book, so there are a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, for a total of 3 books.
Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, for a total of 3 books.

Since each book is read twice (once by its owner and once by the other person), the total number of books read is 3 (books) x 2 (times read) = 6.

However, this calculation double-counts the number of books read. A more accurate approach is to consider that each person reads 3 books, and there are 2 people, so the total number of books read is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

However, this is the total number of pages exchanged, and Mike only writes half of them. So, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is 60 / 2 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly limit.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason used for his daily calls with his boss. Since this month has 30 days, and each call is 15 minutes, the total minutes used for these calls is:
30 days * 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes

In addition to these daily calls, Jason also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes he has used is:
450 minutes (daily calls) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's monthly limit to find out how many minutes he has left:
1000 minutes (monthly limit) - 750 minutes (total used) = 250 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin was left with:
19 - 10 = 9

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had:
9 + x

Then, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, Griffin was left with:
9 + x - 2

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
9 + x - 2 = 27

Solving for x, we get:
x = 27 - 9 + 2
x = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The problem states that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). We can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours of makeup work done. 

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. 
Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
Total amount before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total amount after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the animals he killed on both nights:

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we need to first determine the number of cows in each stall after the purchase.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls (not 10, as the problem states he puts them into each of the twenty stalls). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

Total weight = 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. 

Weight eaten by termites = 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Weight of the tree after termites ate 30% = Total weight - Weight eaten by termites

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Solving for x, we get:

x = 44

So Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, the number of bananas Jamal has is:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea's fruits: 52 (apples) + 24 (bananas) = 76

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees and then the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the time to cook the chicken is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find the total amount spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then add them together.

The cost of newspaper ads is the number of newspaper ads multiplied by the cost per ad, which is 50 * $5 = $250.

The cost of television ads is the number of television ads multiplied by the cost per ad, which is 15 * $75 = $1125.

Now, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house, then multiply by the number of houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 * 2 = 6.

In addition to the bedroom windows, each house has 4 more windows. So, the total number of windows per house is 6 (bedroom windows) + 4 (additional windows) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater to find the total number of stitches for the sleeves:
1800 (total) - 1170 (body, collar, and rosette) = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we can add the number of lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48 cards. 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, which is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

The rest of the cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, which is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Current combined age: 20
Additional years for Mico: 10
Additional years for Marco: 10
Total additional years: 10 + 10 = 20

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. So, we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100

Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

"To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones in the necklace. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones occupy 8 inches. Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can calculate the number of sterling silver beads by dividing the total length available for the beads (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch). 

Number of sterling silver beads = 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total amount of money from the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total amount of money from the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the total amount of money from the quarters and the dimes to get the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, we subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds
Number of trucks = 3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all flagstones are transported in one trip. However, in this case, the result is a whole number.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

Speed of car in slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, and the car in the slow lane needs to cover the same distance, we can plug in the values:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes break = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval to find her total earnings.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, we need to distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have more than 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not get an extra point because he has less than 20 points.

So, after the extra points have been distributed:
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of rice and then divide the total weight of the bag by the daily consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the daily consumption per person is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bag (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg) to find out how many days the bag will last:
42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

To convert the number of days to weeks, we divide by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 (left back) and page 2 (left front)
- Page 3 (left back) and page 4 (left front)
- ...
- Page 31 (right back) and page 32 (right front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used. However, this assumes that the pages are paired perfectly without any leftover pages.

In this case, 32 is an even number, so we can divide it by 2 without any remainder. 

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and Elise started with 250 books. Therefore, the total number of books she sold in the three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since we know the number of books she sold in the first year (90) and the current year (45), we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting these numbers from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in April. Assuming a 4-week month (which is a reasonable assumption for April), Watson works 5 days a week, 10 hours a day. 

Total hours worked per week = 5 days/week * 10 hours/day = 50 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage:
Hourly wage = $10/hour
Total earnings from hourly wage = 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. 
Total bonus in April = $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.
3. This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves of bread for the rest of the day.
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.
5. Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in a single week, we can calculate the weight lost per 4 weeks by Sandy as 2 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. 

Weight lost per 4 weeks by Sandy = 2 pounds.
Weight lost per week by Sandy = 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.

To find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can divide the total weight by the weight lost per week.

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight lost per week
= 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week
= 16 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings from one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts and savings: 
Amount available for gifts and savings = Total budget - Total expenses
Amount available for gifts and savings = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

Finally, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Amount available for gifts = Amount available for gifts and savings - Amount to be saved
Amount available for gifts = $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day, so their total daily consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total daily egg consumption of the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost:

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and it has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Given that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

1 pole : 3 wires = x poles : 45 wires

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils they each have. Jam has 26 pencils (3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils), and Meg has 46 pencils. 

Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, we can't directly calculate the number of boxes needed. However, we can assume that the boxes are the same size and that they can be filled to capacity.

Let's first find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to find the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils. Since we don't know the capacity of each box, we can't give an exact number of boxes. However, we can assume that the 3 boxes Jam has are full, and we can use that as a reference.

Let's divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in Jam's 3 boxes (26 - 2 = 24 pencils in 3 boxes). 
24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide the total cooling required (65 degrees) by the cooling effect of each ice cube (13 degrees):

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters

"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to find out how many new records each person received on average, and then use the trade ratio to calculate the number of old records.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can find the average number of new records per person by dividing the total number of new records by the number of people:

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to find the average number of old records per person:

1.4 new records per person * 2 old records per new record = 2.8 old records per person

Now, we can multiply the average number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records:

2.8 old records per person * 5 people = 14 old records

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

However, this is incorrect as the 60 would include non-programmers. We need to find the total number of programmers first. Since we do not have the exact number of programmers, we will assume the 100 employees include non-programmers and the 2/5 ratio only applies to the programmers. 

Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is (2/5)x.

We know that the number of junior programmers is 40, so we can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 40 * (5/2)
x = 100

So, the total number of programmers is 100, which is the same as the total number of employees. This is an incorrect assumption, but we will continue with the given data.

Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = x - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and the senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, which is $2400 per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people becomes (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in at the second bus stop, so the total number of people becomes (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Net income = Gross income - Taxes = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before tax = Gross income - Property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Net income = Net income before tax - Taxes = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, we calculate the additional distance as 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance to get the new daily distance.
New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to get the total distance covered in June.
Total distance = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

"To find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is $4. 
Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9.
Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, we can find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies per day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies per week.

"To find the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts before the discount. 

The cost of 2 shirts at $30 each is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the total cost, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Davos paid: $60 - $24 = $36.

"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we first need to calculate the daily revenue from selling tractors and the daily revenue from selling silos.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we can calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:

Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number of plant pots she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. For the roses, they need twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to determine the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time as 'T'. Then, 30% of T is 15 hours.

0.3 * T = 15

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.3:

T = 15 / 0.3
T = 50 hours

Now, we know that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can find this time by multiplying the total time by 0.4:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Since Morgan also needs to be included, we'll subtract her cost from the total budget first:
$90 - $30 = $60

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves each day, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops is:

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given about the gumballs.

Since Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

We are told that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so the total change he had must have been $2 * 2 = $4.

Since Billy started with $10 and had $4 in change, he must have spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Number of days = 18,000 / 900 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

3 * 7 = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we can subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the frames is:
44 * $20 = $880

Since each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, we need to calculate the etching cost:
20% of $880 = 0.20 * $880 = $176

So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is:
$880 + $176 = $1056

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each:
2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is:

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 56 * 2 = 112 shoes.

However, six people returned their pairs, which means 6 * 2 = 12 shoes were returned.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Her total cost is $18. 

Now, let's calculate her total profit:
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $36 - $18
Total profit = $18

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, the total hours she will spend running the lemonade stand is:
Total hours = Total cups / Cups per hour
Total hours = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22
= 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, so she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for Dasha is 18 * $2 = $36.

The difference in cost between David and Dasha is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first calculate the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we need to divide the total length of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12) to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Inches of ribbon per gift bow = Total length of ribbon / Total number of gifts
= 144 inches / 12 gifts
= 12 inches per gift bow.

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we can set up an equation using the given ratio. Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is 'x'. 

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, so the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x, and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x.

We are given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can write this as an equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Now, divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty's popsicles: 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles: 6x = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to first determine the total cost of his new streaming services.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling. The total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without bundling is $10 + $10 = $20. With a 20% discount, the cost is 80% of $20, which is 0.8 * $20 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of his new streaming services from the cost of his old cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spent 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100:

(90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, then subtract the cards she passed out, and finally add the cards she received.

Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30.

Total cards Erica initially had = 20 (made by her) + 30 (pre-made) = 50

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she initially had: 50 - 29 = 21

Finally, add the cards she received from family and friends: 21 + 17 = 38

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

The total number of slices given to Bill and Mark is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

The total number of slices left is 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save money to buy the bike, we need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Mark currently has $50 in his bank account, and the bike costs $300. Therefore, the amount he still needs to save is:

$300 (bike cost) - $50 (current savings) = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find the number of days he needs to save:

$250 / $10 = 25 days

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs separately.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders.

Next, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3rd the number of spiders. 
Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90 = 30

Now, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Finally, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first determine the ages of Alice and Beth in relation to Erica's age.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5 years
Beth's age = 30 years + 5 years
Beth's age = 35 years

Now, since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7 years
Alice's age = 35 years + 7 years
Alice's age = 42 years

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
Age difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Age difference = 42 years - 30 years

"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to determine the total number of days he works in a year and multiply that by his daily wage.

Since the builder works 6 days a week and there are approximately 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total number of days he works in a year as follows:

6 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. To account for this, we can calculate the total number of days he works in a year as follows:

6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we can multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage to determine his annual earnings:

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient:
- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours, 
7200 watt-hours/day = 7.2 kWh/day
In 30 days, the total energy used at the original usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day
In 30 days, the total energy used at the reduced usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Now, we can find the energy saved by subtracting the reduced usage from the original usage:
Energy saved = 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
One zebra has 36 stripes. 
Another zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by 4:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient:

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the weight of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound:

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then calculate the additional quantities, and finally add them together.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

The total number of corns now is 80 + 60 = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 + 100 = 240.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount

3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this 'x'.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
6. The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister: 60 (tallest trees) + 45 (shortest trees) = 105 apples.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples.

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for this segment is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for two days, we don't need to multiply by the number of days.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for this segment is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can add up the distances for all segments to find the total distance traveled by Tom:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we need to subtract the introductory period and the increased rate period from the total months to find the number of months at the normal rate. 
However, since the introductory period is 6 months and the increased rate period is 10 months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10), the normal rate period is indeed 8 months. 
The cost is:

25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1. 
So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we can add the costs of all the items together to find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Kenny needs to buy the ticket and have $50 in spending cash. 
Total amount needed = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
Total amount needed = $100 + $50
Total amount needed = $150

Since Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each, we can set up an equation to find the total number of cards he sold. 
Let's denote the total number of cards he sold as 'x'. 
Then, the total amount he earned from selling the cards is 1.5x.

We know that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. 
Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as 'y'. 
Then, the number of cards he sold is (2/3)y.

Since the number of cards he sold is 'x', we can equate (2/3)y to x. 
x = (2/3)y

We also know that the total amount he earned from selling the cards is $150. 
So, 1.5x = 150

Now, we can solve for x. 
x = 150 / 1.5
x = 100

Now that we know x, we can find y. 
x = (2/3)y
100 = (2/3)y
y = 100 * (3/2)
y = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests who could have one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs that were not available is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog was missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Since Indras has 6 letters in her name, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pan set is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. The total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

Since Dora has $18 and the total cost of the items is $19, she needs $19 - $18 = $1 more.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount in each container as follows:

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

3 gallons/container * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

3/4 gallon * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money George spent on chips and then find out how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = $1.20

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. To find the amount he spent, we can calculate 99% of $5:
$5 * 0.99 = $4.95

Since George spent $1.20 on chips, the amount he spent on candy bars is:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars George bought with $3.75. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
$3.75 / 0.75 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. Since Ray kept 5 lollipops, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, they ate 2 pieces.

The weight of each piece is the total weight of the cake divided by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, the total weight of the cake they ate is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width of the room. 

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width of the room, we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters. To do this, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease due to the open window is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is 90% of Jon's swim time. 
James' swim time = 0.9 * 40 minutes = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James' bike ride time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
James' total time = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

We can now calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time = 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we first need to find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * (30 minutes / 60 minutes)
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got to the initial number of shoes:
200 (initial) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total:
300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to find out the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. 

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans worth of cupcakes she should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find the number of pans, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold: 48 / 12 = 4.

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes.

"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

The pen cost $2. The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so the paper cost 3 * $2 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Theo gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to calculate the total pencils at the beginning of the year, the pencils used after two months, and the pencils left at the end of the year.

Initially, there were 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total pencils at the beginning of the year were:
30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the pencils used were:
(1/5) * 300 pencils = 60 pencils

The remaining pencils after two months were:
300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the pencils left were:
(1/3) * 240 pencils = 80 pencils

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (x / 2) + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(x / 2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we can first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x / 2) = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's length) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to determine the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total number of students.

Given that three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home, the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents 1/4 of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:

(1/4) * Total = 20

To solve for the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total = 20 * 4
Total = 80

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Since Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes is 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days.

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (12) to find the daily walking time:

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15). 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we first need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this number. The principle states that the number of elements in the union of two sets is the sum of the number of elements in each set, minus the number of elements in their intersection.

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12

Total number of people going on the tour: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 
So, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and his player can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs to his player.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs on his player. Since Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs to his player.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and then multiply it by the amount he gave up per orange.

First, let's find the number of oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, we can calculate it as follows:

Total oranges picked = 60
Fraction of oranges eaten = 2/5
Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume per day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To calculate the total amount of oats needed for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Given that one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can calculate the number of bags needed by dividing the total amount of oats required by the weight of oats per bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation, we get (B/2) + 7 + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: B = 36.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 36/2 = 18.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 25% of $400 is:
$400 * 0.25 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent on CDs from the remaining money:
$400 - $100 = $300

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. 

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

"To find the profit earned by Tara, we need to calculate the total cost of the bags and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Total cost = Number of packs * Number of bags per pack * Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $4/pack = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160

However, the cost per pack is for 5 bags, so the cost per bag is $4/5 = $0.80 per bag. 
Total cost = 8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $0.80/bag = 8 * 5 * 0.80 = $32

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $8/bag = 8 * 5 * 8 = $320

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of minutes in the fight and then multiply it by the average punches per minute.

There are 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, so the total number of minutes is:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * Suzanne's cookies
Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find the amount he gave to his sister, and finally determine the amount he spent on dinner.

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is $160 / 2 = $80. The amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

- A sweater requires 12 skeins of wool.
- A pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool.
- A pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool.

Total number of skeins required for one set of winter wear: 
2 (hat) + 4 (scarf) + 12 (sweater) + 1 (mittens) + 2 (socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha is making winter wear for 3 grandchildren, she will need:

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual picking rates of each person.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can add up the individual picking rates to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we will divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Number of uses = 3 (cookies, granola, snack mix)
Cups of raisins per use = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make, we will divide the cups of raisins for the cookies by the amount of raisins per batch.

Cups of raisins for cookies = 9 cups
Raisins per batch = 3/4 cup
Number of batches = 9 cups / (3/4 cup) = 9 / 0.75 = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after the addition.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatt-hours per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatt-hours per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatt-hours - 2016 kilowatt-hours = 336 kilowatt-hours per week.

Since a kilowatt-hour costs $1.50, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is 336 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $504.

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take the same person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the total time it would take to paint a whole house would be the total time for one person divided by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has, then the number of chairs Jenna has, and finally the number of sofas Jenna has.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid.

Cost of CD: $4
Total amount paid: $48

Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs = $44 / $4
Number of CDs = 11

Since Tom already bought one CD, we need to add that to the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set.

Total CDs = Number of CDs + 1 (already bought)

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and add the hours spent in the weeks with the exceptions.

Josh spent 4 hours per week for 8 weeks, except for 3 weeks. So, he spent 4 hours per week for 5 weeks. 
Total hours spent in the 5 weeks with the usual routine = 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

Now, let's calculate the hours spent in the weeks with exceptions. 
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
- He spent 6 hours in one week.

Total hours spent in the weeks with exceptions = 10 hours + 6 hours = 16 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and the weeks with exceptions to find the total hours spent.
Total hours spent = 20 hours + 16 hours = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. 
Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. 
So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. 
Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number who got off get on the bus. 
So, 1/3 of 21 is 7, and 7 passengers get on the bus. 
The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66.

Next, we are given that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as x. In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Since Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 60 - 5
x + 8 = 55
x = 55 - 8
x = 47

However, this is Jame's cousin's age in 8 years. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 47:

Initial candies George had = 5 + 3
Initial candies George had = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had by multiplying the initial number of candies George had by 2.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

The first half of the month has 15 days (April 1-15), and the second half also has 15 days (April 16-30).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total savings:

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since 'x' represents the daily savings in the first half, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x', which is 2 * 25 = 50.

The time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water is 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. The time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water is 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings amount by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we divide the target savings amount by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, which is 3 * $40 = $120.

The total cost of lunch at Subway is the sum of the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 + $120 = $160.

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker, since Peter's locker size is relative to Zack's.

Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which is 24 cubic inches. So, Zack's locker size is:
24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, Peter's locker size is:
12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the daily recommended cups of coffee and then calculate the amount of coffee Octavia and Juan drink.

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups, so x = 4. 

Now we can calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between the amount of coffee Juan drinks and the daily recommended amount.

The difference is 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the average weight of the three friends by adding their weights and dividing by 3:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
= 540 / 3

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the additional angle covered by the sun's movement.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so it is also at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground initially.

The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. To find the total angle covered by the sun's movement, we multiply the rate of movement by the time:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun is moving upward from the pyramid, we add the angle covered by the sun's movement to the initial angle of the pyramid:

32 degrees (initial angle) + 50 degrees (additional angle) = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total amount James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total. 

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total amount James spends: 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time she spent reading: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the nephew's current age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then set up an equation based on the given information.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as x. We can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

Since x represents the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from x:

Nephew's current age = 17 - 7
Nephew's current age = 10

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth, so the total amount for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is $0.50 per tooth. The total amount for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. This means he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent 4 * $10 = $40. The number of wooden action figures he bought is $40 / $5 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend $10 per day on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, for these 3 days, he spent 3 * $10 = $30. The number of plastic action figures he bought is $30 / $2 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, we can calculate the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. In this case, 10 sandwiches are sold for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since 10 sandwiches are sold, the cost of bread is:

$3.00 per loaf (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches)

The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost is:

$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

$70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Difference = 468 - 450 = 18°F

Percentage error = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we can apply this percentage error to the required temperature of 520°F.

Error = 4% of 520

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the 10% discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of 1 box is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running is:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

The total calories burned during her workout is the sum of the calories burned during aerobics and running:

2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the two implants, including the additional cost of the porcelain crown for one of them.

The base price of two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The additional cost of the porcelain crown is $500.
The total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage.

Number of hours = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can start by representing the smallest angle as 'x'. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as '2x'. The angle that is three times the smallest angle can be represented as '3x'.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since 90 degrees is the largest angle, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them together.

Initially, Steve received 5 games with the console.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. The total number of games Steve has after the first year is 5 (initial games) + 17 (games bought and received in the first year) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. The total number of games Steve has after the second year is 22 (games he already had) + 29 (games bought and received in the second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. The total number of games Steve has after the third year is 51 (games he already had) + 53 (games bought and received in the third year) = 104 games.

"To find the additional time it would take to travel 2000 miles, we first need to determine the plane's speed. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the plane's speed, we can calculate the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds Ruiz can make in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Since Ruiz can make 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours, Ruiz can make:

60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

(3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour (this is the amount Marissa makes in 1 hour compared to Ruiz's 2-hour production)

However, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa makes in 1 hour compared to Ruiz's 1-hour production. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, we can calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

(3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour

In 12 hours, Marissa can make:

45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

720 (Ruiz) + 540 (Marissa) = 1260

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the first 4 hours were 15 * $0.50 = $7.50. Since he sold lemonade for 4 hours, his total earnings for the first 4 hours were 4 * $7.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the next 2 hours were 10 * $0.60 = $6. Since he sold lemonade for 2 hours, his total earnings for the next 2 hours were 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to find the total earnings: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations.

First, we need to find the number of rotations per mile. The car's tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, so the number of rotations per mile is 725 / 2 = 362.5.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the number of rotations per month is 362.5 * 400 = 145,000.

To find the number of rotations per year, we multiply the number of rotations per month by 12: 145,000 * 12 = 1,740,000.

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the yearly rotations (1,740,000) to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced: 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6.

"To find the cost per pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle of shampoo. The directions state that 2 pumps will give 120 washings. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washings (and thus the total number of pumps) will be twice that, which is 2 * 120 = 240 pumps.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump. The cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= 2400 cents / 240 pumps
= 10 cents per pump

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 x $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
Discounted price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left:
$50 - $42 = $8

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

Initial 5 months: 
The funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. Since this is the initial funding, we can assume it's the monthly funding for these 5 months. 
So, the cost for the initial 5 months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

Additional months: 
The research took 10 times the initial duration, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months. 
However, we've already accounted for the first 5 months, so the additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 
The funding for these additional months is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month. 
So, the cost for the additional 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Total cost: 
The total cost of John's research is the sum of the cost for the initial 5 months and the additional months. 
Total cost = $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, we add the ounces of meat eaten by the three players: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we calculate the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total cost / Number of classes attended ≤ $10

Since there are 10 total classes, let's say Manny attends x classes. Then, the equation becomes:

$60 / x ≤ $10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend, we can rearrange the equation to solve for x:

x ≥ $60 / $10
x ≥ 6

This means Manny can attend at most 6 classes while keeping the cost per class below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:

Now, we can calculate the total number of customers both can process in a day by adding their individual daily production: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7 (the number of days in a week): 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of the hole can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:
Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the time it takes Bob to shovel a cubic foot of earth:
Time = Volume * Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade = (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will assume it is not included in the calculation.

Total cost of added features: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Total cost of the truck: Base price + Total cost of added features = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Since the bonus is given once, we will add it to his total yearly salary. His yearly salary without the bonus is $21,000 * 12 = $252,000.

Total yearly salary with the bonus = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount would be 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid was $600 - $60 = $540.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we first need to determine the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can calculate the sales from green hats as follows:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate the total sales in the second month as follows:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * $1200
Total sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total sales in the first and second months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900

The total number of pages in the book is 200 pages, and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. 

Total number of days to read the book = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
Total number of days to read the book = 200 pages / 10 pages/day
Total number of days to read the book = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the total number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment.

Number of days before the deadline = Total number of days to complete the assignment - Total number of days to read the book
Number of days before the deadline = 30 days - 20 days

"To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly hanger rental cost is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is:
$5000/month * 12 months = $60,000

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly hanger rental cost, which is:
$5000 * 2 = $10,000/month
The total fuel cost for the first year is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can write:
S + G = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, subtract the new equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
S = 15

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between the target height and the initial height. 

First, let's convert the initial height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply the initial height in feet by 12 to get the initial height in inches.

Initial height (in inches) = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, let's calculate the difference between the target height and the initial height.

Height difference = Target height - Initial height

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The final answer: 80"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, the time taken for this part is half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, the time taken for this part is half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for both modes: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes to walk to school. 
They've spent 6 minutes walking to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 
So, the total time they've spent walking so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time they've spent walking from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.

"To find the total number of cookies in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as:

T = t + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:

2T + 3t = 44

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation above:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding the equation:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 

Total homework time = 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history)
Total homework time = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes
Time for nap = 100 minutes

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Since the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, we can subtract the cost of the lollipops to find the cost of the candies. 
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This is the cost of 4 candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide by 4:
$1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of coins Rong saves in a year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins. The total number of coins Neil saves in a year is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they will have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is $40.

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. We can set up the equation:

0.4x = 40

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 40 / 0.4
x = 100

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is:

0.6 * 100 = 60

Now, we can verify that the vaccines are indeed 40% of the total bill:

0.4 * 100 = 40

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

125 - 100 = 25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

First, we know the price of an apple is $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, the price of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.
It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can add the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 adults and 15 babies. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Mia already has 8 high chairs, so she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

She also needs 42 regular chairs, but she only has 40. So, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

"To find the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then multiply it by the total number of hours.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the problem doesn't specify the proportion of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, we'll assume the factory can switch between the two flavors. To maximize production, the factory would make chocolate ice cream, as it has a higher production rate.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

However, if the factory makes both flavors, we need to consider the production rate of both. Assuming the factory makes chocolate ice cream for 24 hours and vanilla ice cream for 24 hours (to simplify the calculation), the total production would be:

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 24 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 24 hours = 1200 quarts.
Total quarts of vanilla ice cream in 24 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour * 24 hours = 300 quarts.

Total quarts in 48 hours = 1200 quarts + 300 quarts = 1500 quarts.

However, this is not the maximum possible production. To maximize production, the factory would make chocolate ice cream for the entire 48 hours.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount.
The discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in these 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in these 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The total cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt and the potential fine from the city council. 
3 buckets of asphalt cost 3 * $25 = $75.
Adding the potential fine, the total cost is $75 + $120 = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to his car, which is $450. 
By fixing the pothole, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255.

"To find the total number of chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Total normal chairs = 170
Total baby chairs = 23
Total chairs = 170 + 23 = 193

Chairs sent for repair:
Normal chairs = 20
Baby chairs = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Now, subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

"To find the total number of slices left, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices ordered.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2/3 of a pizza is (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices. Since there are three people (Bryce and two friends), they ate 3 * 8 = 24 slices in total.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. ¾ of a pizza is (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices. Since there are two friends, they ate 2 * 9 = 18 slices in total.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Since there are 5 pizzas in total (one for each person), the total number of slices ordered is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. 

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * Time taken by the cat
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can calculate the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages.

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 90.

Then, we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

Total number of blue spools = 60

Total number of spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total number of spools = 150

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Total number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who had voted by that time and subtract it from the total number of people.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people were 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
Total pieces of gum in 30 days = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack.

Number of packs = Total pieces / Pieces per pack
= 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so the kids will need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more apiece, so the adults will need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. 
The total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves required. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves required by 3 to find the number of boxes required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

She has math and science books, each weighing 2 pounds. Since there are two books, their combined weight is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the history book weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books:

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate A and candidate B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total number of voters - Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

"To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation:

Cost of gallon jar = Cost of half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Cost of half-gallon jar + $2

Subtracting $2 from both sides gives us the cost of a half-gallon jar:

Cost of half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

Total cost = (Cost of gallon jar * Number of gallon jars) + (Cost of half-gallon jar * Number of half-gallon jars)
Total cost = ($5 * 10) + ($3 * 16)

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

Number of girls in each class = Number of students in each class * 0.4
= 40 * 0.4

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house will need 2x cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first, so it will need 2x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

Since the third house needs double the first, it will need 2x = 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the individual costs and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so his total cost is 1 * $3 = $3.

Now, we add the individual costs together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"To find the total number of fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of bananas = 200
Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)
= 200 + (0.45 * 200)
= 200 + 90
= 290

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears:
Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she spent on the candy bars. 

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, so the amount of money she had left is $80 - $20 = $60.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can find the number of candy bars she bought by dividing the amount of money she spent on candy bars ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5).

Number of candy bars = $60 / $5 = 12

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation:

Ezra's books = 2 * Ahmed's books
300 = 2 * Ahmed's books

To find Ahmed's books, we divide both sides by 2:
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra's total books will be:
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is the sum of their individual totals:
Total books = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's books
Total books = 450 + 150
Total books = 600

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours taught would be 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours taught would be 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30. Since she taught less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company has 4 vanilla scents and sells 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 4 * 5 = 20.

The company has 8 fruity scents and sells 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the difference in sales, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he has already made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is:
20 eggplants * $3 per eggplant = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn:
$135 (total) - $60 (from eggplants) = $75 (from corn)

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount of money he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

"To find the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total hours available and the hours spent on activities other than soccer.

Total hours available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Hours spent reading = 3 hours

Remaining hours after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Hours spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Hours spent on activities other than soccer = 3 hours (reading) + 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours

Hours spent playing soccer = Total hours available - Hours spent on activities other than soccer
= 12 hours - 6 hours
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the hours spent playing soccer by the total hours available and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time spent driving to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time spent driving to the museum = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each category of movies separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in each category:
- Total movies = 600
- Movies in series = 1/3 * 600 = 200
- Remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400
- Older movies = 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160
- Normal movies = 400 - 160 = 240

Now, let's calculate the cost of each category:
- Cost of movies in series = 200 * (1/3 * $10) = 200 * $3.33 = $666.67 (round to $666.67, but for calculation purposes we will use $666.67)
- Cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800
- Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

Total cost = $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Now, let's consider the points from the remaining time on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, if Emma has 't' seconds left, Ava has 't - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30t
Points from time for Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for Emma and Ava:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)

The difference between their scores is the total points for Ava minus the total points for Emma:
Difference = [(10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30t - 120)] - (10x + 5y + 30t)
= 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the days they ride twice as much, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times a day for 2 days. So, the total number of rides on these days is:
6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

The total number of rides in a week is the sum of the rides on the usual days and the days they ride twice as much:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that x + y = 17, since he bought 17 fish in total.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had 3 + y orange fish and 4 + x white fish. According to the problem, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + y = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

y = 5 + 2x

We also know that x + y = 17. Substituting y = 5 + 2x into this equation:

x + (5 + 2x) = 17

Combine like terms:

3x + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide by 3:

x = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he drives per week and the amount of fuel he consumes.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of days he drives per week is 5. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance per day is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles. 

The total distance driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the amount of fuel consumed per week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, and she had 10 twenties. 3/5 of 10 is:
(3/5) * 10 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups with seashells = Total number of groups * (3/5)
= 10 * (3/5)
= 6

Since each group has 9 members and each member brought 2 seashells, we can find the total number of seashells by multiplying the number of groups with seashells by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees/month) * 3 (months) = 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month after three months will be:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total amount paid over the three months. 
In the first month, the company pays 200 * $4000 = $800,000.
In the second month, the company pays 220 * $4000 = $880,000.
In the third month, the company pays 240 * $4000 = $960,000.

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

Since the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can first divide both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
Hours still needed to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be the difference between the distance traveled by the second car and the distance traveled by the first car:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the total cost of the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold) and then add the premium.

The total cost of the materials is $600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the materials, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost James paid is the sum of the cost of the materials and the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Overall pass rate: 70%"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available glass chips. 

Since each square inch requires 12 glass chips, and Milo has 2 bags of 72 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144.

Now, we can calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can calculate the length by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining amount of tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount of tea consumed, we get:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To find out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies, but since he didn't have them, he must have taken orders for 150 candies. To fulfill these orders, he ordered 100 more candies. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has: 
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies

Since Dale has taken orders for 150 candies, he still needs to sell the remaining candies to sell all of his candy. 
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320) to find the additional students who joined:

320 - 10 = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores by 2 (since there are two kids).

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then add them up.

First, let's calculate the number of quarters Jack uses. Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, and they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 

Number of quarters Jack uses = 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

Two of Jack's friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, which is 10 minutes per quarter. 

Number of quarters each of the two friends uses = 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters.
Total quarters used by the two friends = 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of Jack's friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

Number of quarters the better friend uses = 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used by all four friends:
Total quarters used = 12 quarters (Jack) + 48 quarters (two friends) + 8 quarters (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
Total money used = 68 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $17.

z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10

Combine like terms:

10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

z = 1

Now, we can find the amount of oil used by multiplying 'z' by 4:

Oil = 4z

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. 

$125,000 / 20 students = $6,250 per student.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, the sum of the cards that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have is equal to 341:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original purchase price is $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount, so the refund is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the original purchase price minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

   Time spent recording per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours/week writing songs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for one kangaroo:

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that it will take a turtle twice as long to travel the same distance as a kangaroo. Therefore, the time for one turtle to travel across the highway is:

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the total time it will take them to travel across the highway is the same as the time for one turtle:

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so 5/6 of it is not used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the first glue stick that is not used is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it is not used. The length of the second glue stick that is not used is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it is not used. The length of the third glue stick that is not used is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, we subtract the amount of money he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid and subtract the cost of the hat.

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $80.

The cost of the hat is $70.

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, the number of socks Peter has is:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90 socks
Total number of dishes = 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that there are 5 students who are good at math only. To find the number of students who are good at both math and English, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can find the total number of students who are good at math by adding the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time for performances and then divide it by the time required for each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equal to 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total available time for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time required for each group (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is (3/4) * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount after 3 years:
$300 (principal) + $675 (interest) = $975

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we first need to find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, we can find the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so we can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting this from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine the number of trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the selling price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we need to first determine the total number of pairs James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs is:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

We know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we can divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent / Total number of pairs
= $2640 / 24 pairs
= $110 per pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets to find the total cost: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of the total. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which implies they will build double the amount they have built so far, not that they will build double the amount they have built and add it to the previous amount. Therefore, in the third year, they will build 96 homes, not add 96 homes to the previous amount.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

The total number of homes built is 144."
"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. Given the information:

1. I am three years younger than my brother: A = B - 3
2. I am 2 years older than my sister: A = S + 2
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: Mom's age = 3B - 1
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

We can simplify the equation by substituting A from the first two equations into the fourth equation. From the first equation, we have B = A + 3. From the second equation, we have S = A - 2.

Substituting B and S into the fourth equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87
5A + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
5A = 78

Divide by 5:
A = 15.6

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find the number of packs needed:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs.

"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to consider the initial amount, the increase after the first day of heavy rain, and the additional increase on the third day.

The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.

Day 2: 70 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previously infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected at the beginning of the day. Each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previously infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip per customer = $20
Total tips for Rafaela = Number of customers * Tip per customer
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20
Total tips for Rafaela = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips.

10% of Rafaela's total tips = 0.1 * $800
10% of Rafaela's total tips = $80
Total tips for Julieta = Total tips for Rafaela - $80
Total tips for Julieta = $800 - $80
Total tips for Julieta = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we need to add their individual totals.

Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela = Total tips for Julieta + Total tips for Rafaela
Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela = $720 + $800
Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela = $1520

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she gave away and subtract that from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so she gave away 3 * 2 = 6 oranges to her daughters. She also gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

The total number of oranges she gave away is 6 (to her daughters) + 3 (to her boy) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. After giving away 9 oranges, she remained with 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year:
36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she sold and then multiply that by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to determine the number of silver coins and then add it to the number of gold coins.

We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. However, we are also given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of books each person has as follows: 
- Sofie: S
- Anne: A
- Fawn: F

We are given the following information:
1. S + A + F = 85 (Total number of books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve for Fawn's books. First, we'll express A in terms of F from equation 3:
A = F - 12

Now, substitute A in equation 2 to express S in terms of F:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now, substitute S and A in the first equation using the expressions we derived:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide by 3:
F = 28

Fawn has 28 books."

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find the selling price of the chickens and then subtract the profit to get the cost price.

Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of 300 chickens, which is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

He wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens at $50 each. So, the total selling price of the chickens is the profit plus the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as x.

The total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

Since the profit is $2000, we can set up the equation: 
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
$9000 = x + $2000

Now, we can solve for x:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can set up an equation to find her current age:

Current age + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

Current age = 18 - 10
Current age = 8

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number of years 'x'. We can set up another equation:

Current age + x = 3 * Current age

Substituting the value of current age, we get:

8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

However, this is the total number of years from now when her age will be thrice her present age. But we already know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we need to subtract 10 from 'x' to find the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her present age, after she turns 18.

x = 16 - 10 + 10 (to account for the 10 years that have already passed) 
x = 16 

However, the correct interpretation is that Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years from now, but 6 years after she turns 18.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $60 = $5.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel's pages from yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total remains 13 pages.

Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages. 
Daniel's total pages read is 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the total number of bowls the family will eat for dinner and subtract that from the total capacity of the pot.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 2 adults and 2 children will be eating dinner, we can calculate the total number of bowls as follows:

- 2 adults = 2 adult bowls
- 2 children = 2 child bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, we can convert the child bowls to adult bowls for easier comparison. Given that 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can convert the 2 child bowls to 1 adult bowl (2 child bowls / 2 = 1 adult bowl).

Now, the total number of bowls for dinner is:
- 2 adult bowls (for the adults) + 1 adult bowl (for the children) = 3 adult bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, the leftover soup will be:
- 4 adult bowls (total capacity) - 3 adult bowls (used for dinner) = 1 adult bowl

Now, we convert the leftover 1 adult bowl to child bowls:
- 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover child bowls by 2 to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch:
- 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 time per child

"To determine the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, the total material needed for the small masks is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the exact amount needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, the total material needed for 3 sets of large masks is 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards. However, we only need 8 masks, so we will calculate the material needed for 8 masks: 8 / 3 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Adam's current age. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'A' and Duncan's current age as 'D'. We are given that Duncan's current age is 60.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Since we know Duncan's current age, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can solve for A:

2A = 52 + 8
2A = 60
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of the two farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, his hourly earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by his pay per package: 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

To find his total earnings in an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works: $8 * 8 = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we first need to determine the total time it takes him to solve the extreme sudoku. 

Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku, and a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, the time for an extreme sudoku is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (or 30 minutes), we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks. 

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18. We also know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 3y = 18, where 'y' is the number of yellow balloons.

To solve for 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: y = 18 / 3 = 6.

The number of yellow balloons is 6."

Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, divide the total miles driven by the tune-up interval:
Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / tune-up interval
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea in each row is:

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

As the number of chamomile and mint tea cups is equal in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row:

2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can start by substituting equation (2) into equation (1):

P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 90

Now, substitute equation (3) into the above equation:

(L + J) + 2J = 90

Substitute equation (2) into the above equation:

(J + 10 + J) + 2J = 90

Combine like terms:

4J + 10 = 90

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation (2):

L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's ages, we can find Peter's age using equation (3):

P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles she has after redeeming the coupons. 

Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles she gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of hours, as the problem states ""or part thereof."" So, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, we can add up the costs to find the total charge:
$40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for after the discount, and the amount he received from selling 5 of them.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost (100% - 40% discount). 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he received $40 from the sale.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he received from the sale from the amount he paid:
$90 (amount paid) - $40 (amount received) = $50.

"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

The revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.
The revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.
The revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we add the revenues together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's calculate the distance James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile distance, the distance he swam initially is:
20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can calculate the time it took him to swim this distance at his initial pace of 2 miles per hour:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming, James rested for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
Resting time = 6 hours / 2
Resting time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum initially
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half his initial speed for the remaining distance, his new speed is:
New speed = Initial speed / 2
New speed = 2 miles/hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can calculate the time it took him to swim the remaining distance:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour
Time = 8 hours

Finally, we can calculate the total time it took James to cross the lake by adding the initial swimming time, resting time, and the final swimming time:
Total time = Initial swimming time + Resting time + Final swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"To find Leo's age, we need to first determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that:
1. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
2. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)
3. A + B + D = 45 (Total points scored by the team)

From equation 1, we can express B in terms of A. From equation 2, we can express D in terms of B, and then substitute B from equation 1.

D = B - 10
D = (A + 20) - 10
D = A + 10

Now, we can substitute B and D in terms of A into the total points equation:

A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3A = 15

Divide by 3:
A = 5

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches, which is 1.5 inches. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so his stapling rate is:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we can multiply the total minutes by his stapling rate to find the total number of reports stapled:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total time she spent sleeping and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so the actual time she slept is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also spent 23 minutes (from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.) sleepwalking. Subtracting this from the total time, we get 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to determine the initial number of measuring spoons and cups he had.

Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first determine the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, we need to calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks. 
Number of new patients admitted per day = 50
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14
Total new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700

Now, we subtract the total new patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the final number of unoccupied beds.
Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 800 - 700 = 100

48 = x + (20% of x)
48 = x + 0.2x
48 = 1.2x

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then determine the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan can be expressed as 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by the three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:

Total number of episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total number of episodes = 20 / 2
Total number of episodes = 10

Now, we can calculate the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Total number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

1. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first leg: 
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled in the northerly direction for the second leg:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the third leg:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this distance from the total southerly distance to get the actual distance between the two homes.

Distance between the bird's northern and southern homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. The number of oranges she gave away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers required to fill the flower bed. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each flower takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each flower. So, the total space taken up by each flower and the space between flowers is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space taken up by each flower and the space between flowers: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 44 flowers.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is 27 * 6 = $162.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of the number of pretzels Edgar eats. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
His brother eats 1/2 as many, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 18 * 0.5 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil available (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year and then divide it by the cost of each pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00, and she sets aside 25% of it for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year is:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we can divide the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them:

15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change over the given time period.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was x + 75 years old.

We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was x + 75 years old, we can set up the equation x + 75 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 90 - 75 = 15.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. 

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes as x. Since the second plane's trips are half of the first plane's trips, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day. 

Now, we know that three-quarters of the flights go to Greece, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Three-quarters of 88 flights is:

(3/4) * 88 = 66 flights to Greece

The remaining flights are:

88 - 66 = 22 flights

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is:

22 / 2 = 11 flights

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W' and the age of Helene as 'H'. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

We can express the total age as the sum of the ages of all the children:
3 (Akbar) + 4 (Alessandro) + H (Helene) + W (Wilfred) = 20

Combine the known ages:
7 + H + W = 20

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene's age is twice the average age:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now, substitute Helene's age into the equation for the total age:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the known values:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides to find Wilfred's age:
W = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The total amount collected from the neighbors is $500. 
The total amount collected from the online fund is $1500. 
The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend gives him $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 
Three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:
1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

"To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of slices. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x'. Then, the size of each adult's slice would be '2x'.

We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices can be represented as:

2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x

This represents the total size of the watermelon. Now, we want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size '2x', we can calculate the percentage as:

(2x / 8x) * 100% = (1/4) * 100% = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:

4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the serving time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first determine the total cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per month.

The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student. 

Cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
Cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10)
Cost per session = $25 + $15
Cost per session = $40

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month can be calculated as follows:
Number of sessions per month = Number of sessions per week * Number of weeks in a month
Assuming a month has 4 weeks, 
Number of sessions per month = 3 * 4
Number of sessions per month = 12

Now, we can calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month by multiplying the cost per session by the number of sessions per month.

Expected earnings per month = Cost per session * Number of sessions per month
Expected earnings per month = $40 * 12
Expected earnings per month = $480

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons
Total water pumped: 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, and 12000 gallons have been pumped. To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's denote the initial charge as x.

The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, so the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
x - 5 * 0.09x = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

Then, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, so the charge remaining after 3 more hours is:
0.55x - 3 * 0.07 * 0.55x = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4345x

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests remaining is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains the same.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:
76 (remaining guests) + 30 (new guests) = 106

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the total number of guests now is:
106 + 7 = 113

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22

The total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To find the total points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she is sure to get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions are easy, so:
Easy questions = 0.4 * 60 = 24

The rest of the questions (60 - 24 = 36) are equally divided as average and difficult questions, so:
Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
Easy questions correct = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions correct = 0.5 * 18 = 9
Difficult questions correct = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Total questions correct = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa's total earnings from the sales of large and small stuffed animals is $120. This can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week is:
11 sandwiches per day * 7 days per week = 77 sandwiches per week

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day per dwarf = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich based on the given information. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

At this point, Sally had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection, making the total number of balloons 28 + 6 = 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the complementary events and multiply the probabilities of each step.

First, the probability that the normal teacher comes in is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher).

Next, the probability that the normal teacher doesn't give an extension is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Finally, the probability that Marcus can't convince the teacher to give him a personal extension is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, we multiply these probabilities together to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow:

0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of seats available for friends and family. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not explicitly given, but we can infer it from the information provided. Since there are 950 seats for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total earnings and total expenses, then subtract the expenses from the earnings and divide by the total number of hours worked.

Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total number of hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, we divide the total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours worked to find the hourly wage: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes him to move to each bottle:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed and the total amount of money he lost by not working while in school.

The total amount of money Jim borrowed is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

The total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is his previous income of $25,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and make up for the lost income is:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year ($25,000 * 3). To find out how long it would take him to earn $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of each fabric piece is calculated by multiplying the length and width.

Area of each fabric piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4

Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food each cat consumes per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed by all cats per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last:

720 / 360 = 2

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we first need to determine the number of slices eaten by Jake and Silvia. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

Total slices eaten: 31"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x' minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18' minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, the sum of Donovan's part and Betsy's part is equal to 98 minutes.

We can set up the equation as follows:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes:
Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the doctor's time, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.
The doctor's time is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Since the doctor charges $300/hour, the cost of the doctor's time is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
The cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response.

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5.

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas left, we can calculate 30% of 20 (since 100% - 70% = 30%):

20 * 0.3 = 6

So, the glee club has 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, so to find the number of pizzas left, we can calculate 20% of 40 (since 100% - 80% = 20%):

40 * 0.2 = 8

So, the football team has 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the number of pizzas left from both groups:

6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Since there are twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400

Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the total cost of mailing the small and big coupons:
Total cost = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
Total cost = 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:
Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we can calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = Number of trucks dispatched - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers as follows:
Total tons of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that delivered * Tons of fertiliser per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we first need to calculate the total number of pounds Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for one pound at full price ($4.00) and the second pound at half price ($2.00). 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten per day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 individual roses for $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected so far is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we will calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: walking halfway to the store, walking back home, and then walking the entire distance to the store.

1. Walking halfway to the store: Since James' home is 4 miles from the store, halfway would be 2 miles. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time taken to walk halfway is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

2. Walking back home: James walks the same 2 miles back home, so the time taken is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

3. Walking the entire distance to the store: After returning home, James walks the entire 4 miles to the store. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time taken is 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

- BMX bikes = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450
- Revenue from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Revenue from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

First, let's calculate the time spent in class per day. John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each Saturday and Sunday. There are 7 * 24 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week. So, the extra learning time per weekend day is (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes.

Since there are 2 weekend days, the total extra learning time per week is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours.

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time: 26.67 + 21 = 47.67 hours.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total surface area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Therefore, the number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he helps per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

The total number of people Billy helps is the number of people he helps per day multiplied by the number of days he works, which is 6 * 40 = 240.

Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the daily time spent and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total daily time spent on breaks is 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the daily time spent on breaks is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the daily time by 5 to find the total time spent on breaks after 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine the total miles run by Amber and Micah. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

The total miles run by Amber and Micah is 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52 miles, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find Ahito's miles. 

52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making the new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. After returning an item that cost $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
So, the price of the towels after the discount is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total amount she spent on the new purchases is:
$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Adding this amount to her previous balance, we get the new balance on her credit card:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
Total retirement savings goal = $40,000 * 20
Total retirement savings goal = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
Number of years to reach goal = $800,000 / $20,000
Number of years to reach goal = 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years. If we assume she has been working for some years already, the number of years she needs to work will be less than 40.

However, to provide a numerical answer, let's assume she just started working. In that case, the number of years she needs to work is 40. But since she wants to retire in 20 years, she needs to work for 20 more years to reach her goal.

40 (total years) - 20 (years she can live off her savings) is not the correct answer. 
The correct answer is simply 20 years of work to save for 20 years of retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the total population based on the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total population = 240
0.4 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women wearing heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
The total number of women wearing heels is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has available for hiking in June. Since June has 30 days, we can assume she will hike for 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily total is:

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her current daily total from the required daily total:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

However, since she hikes twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles by 2 to find out how many more miles per hike she needs to cover:

60 miles per day / 2 hikes per day = 30 miles per hike

So, Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike to complete her journey on time.

The total amount given to Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, and they gave 7 kg to Peter and Paul, they will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

However, the question asks about James, but there is no James mentioned in the initial statement. It seems there might be a mistake in the question, and it should be asking about Pierre, Paul, and Jacques instead. Assuming that's the case, the answer would be:

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop overnight = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase in the morning = 3 degrees Celsius

Net change in temperature = Temperature drop - Temperature increase
Net change in temperature = 8 - 3
Net change in temperature = 5 degrees Celsius

Since the temperature dropped, the net change is a decrease of 5 degrees Celsius.

After buying the two books, Anna has $2 left. This means that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the two books by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5."

Since this is a round trip, we need to multiply the distance by 2:
Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles = 280 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Sofie's and Brian's total miles.

Sofie's total miles = 2 * Brian's total miles
70 miles = 2 * Brian's total miles

To find Brian's total miles, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.

Brian's total miles = 70 miles / 2
Brian's total miles = 35 miles

"To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by all five workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys produced by the first four workers from the total number of toys produced by all five workers to find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked to find the production rate: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk a certain distance is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. 

For the beach, we have: 
40 minutes = 2 miles / x
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of heat transfer and the final temperature of the mixture. Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces. The final temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

We can use the concept of heat transfer to set up an equation. The heat energy of the mixture is the sum of the heat energies of the two components. Since the heat energy is directly proportional to the temperature and volume, we can set up the following equation:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x°F) = (5 oz * 40°F)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

Since x is the temperature of the second mug, we can conclude that the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. 

The cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell will receive a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost.
The final cost is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.
The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree per year, the total number of lemons he collects per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree/year = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade. Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the initial number of women on the bus. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x, where x is a common multiplier. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation:

5x + 9x = 84
14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus:
Initial number of women = 9x
Initial number of women = 9 * 6
Initial number of women = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women who remained on the bus is:
Number of women who remained = Initial number of women - 20
Number of women who remained = 54 - 20
Number of women who remained = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:

84 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, let's add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

Now, let's calculate Adam's loss:

Total cost - Total revenue = Loss

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the number of days required for each type of scene, but this would be incorrect as it would assume she works on each type of scene separately for the entire duration.

A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days required for each type of scene or to find the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

However, in this case, we can simply add the number of days required for each type of scene and then check if there's any overlap or if the total number of days can be reduced.

9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes on different days. So, we can try to find a more efficient way to complete the scenes.

One possible way is to work on large scenes for 9 days, and on the 10th day, she can work on medium scenes. On the 11th day, she can work on small scenes, and on the 12th day, she can work on the remaining medium scenes.

On the 10th day, she can complete the remaining 6 medium scenes in 1 day (6 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 1 day, but she will work on it for 1 day after completing the large scenes).

On the 11th day, she can complete 7 small scenes, and she has 42 small scenes left (49 - 7 = 42). She can complete the remaining small scenes in 6 days (42 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 6 days).

So, the total number of days required is 9 (large) + 1 (medium) + 6 (small) = 16 days, but she worked on small scenes for 7 days (1 day + 6 days), and she worked on medium scenes for 1 day after completing the large scenes, and she can work on the remaining medium scenes in the 7 days she worked on small scenes.

So, the total number of days required is 9 (large) + 7 (small and medium) = 16 days, but she can complete the remaining medium scenes in the 7 days she worked on small scenes.

Therefore, the total number of days required is 9 (large) + 7 (small and medium) = 16 days, but she can complete the remaining medium scenes in the 7 days she worked on small scenes.

Then, she can work on medium scenes for 6 days and complete the 36 medium scenes.

Finally, she can work on the remaining small scenes in 7 days.

So, the total number of days required is 7 (large) + 2 (large) + 6 (medium) + 7 (small) = 22 days, but she can work on the remaining large scenes and medium scenes in the 7 days she worked on small scenes.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we can calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is:
8 * (3/4) = 6

The number of babies wearing blue is:
8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows:
6 * (1/3) = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies with bows, multiplied by 100:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received in the week.

Total reports received in the week = 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received in the week to find the reports received on Wednesday:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $50.

2. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land. Abraham initially had 80 square meters, sold 40, and then 20. So, the remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter. The amount earned from this sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add the amounts earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs hidden and subtract the number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the production of the 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total production:
- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits
- The first 4 years are not given, so we assume they produce 0 fruits each.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as R and the amount Rissa was given as 3R, since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie.

We know Ronnie was given $5, so R = 5. Therefore, Rissa was given 3R = 3 * 5 = 15.

Let's denote the amount of money they each gave to their little sister as x.

After giving x dollars to their little sister, Ronnie is left with R - x = 5 - x dollars.

After giving x dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, which is (4/5) * 3R = (4/5) * 15 = 12 dollars.

We can set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money as 3R - x = 12. Since we know 3R = 15, we can rewrite this as 15 - x = 12.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 - 12 = 3.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of money left in Ronnie's money: 5 - x = 5 - 3 = 2.

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is comprised of the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). 

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, so the yellow portion is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. The remaining portion (red, white, and purple) is also 6 pints.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining portion by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box and the cost per pod.

The regular box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods, so we calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Since the new box costs the same as the regular box ($12), we can calculate the cost per pod as follows:

Cost per pod = Total cost / Number of pods
= $12 / 120
= $0.10 per pod

Now, we need to find out how many pods you can buy for $1:

Number of pods for $1 = $1 / Cost per pod
= $1 / $0.10
= 10 pods

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is equal to the number of pods you can buy for $1.

Number of cycles for $1 = 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. Since each bill is $20, the amount of money he has left is 20 * $20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money. So, he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill: $1200 / $5 = 240.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
Total goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the amount of chalk used each day and the remaining chalk after each day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. The remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day, we can calculate the amount of chalk used each day as 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches (initially). However, this amount will decrease as the chalk gets smaller.

We can calculate the number of days the teacher can use the chalk as follows:

Day 1 (Tuesday): 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches remaining
Day 2 (Wednesday): 2.20 - 0.44 (0.20 * 2.20) = 1.76 inches remaining

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. However, we see that the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches after Monday, but it will be smaller than 0.02 inches after Tuesday, which is very close to 0. 

However, the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches after Monday, but it will be smaller than 0.02 inches after Tuesday, which is very close to 0. The teacher will likely recycle the chalk on Tuesday.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Each friend also eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of pepperoni slices required is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. To find the rate at which he builds snowballs per minute, we divide 20 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs/minute

Now, let's consider the rate at which the snowballs melt. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the rate of melting per minute is:

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs/minute

Since the snowballs are melting, the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs per minute is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt:

Net rate = (1/3 - 2/15) snowballs/minute
= (5/15 - 2/15) snowballs/minute
= 3/15 snowballs/minute
= 1/5 snowballs/minute

Now, we can calculate the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs:

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
= 60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs/minute)
= 60 * 5 minutes
= 300 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:

300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

However, this is the time it would take if Jay starts from 0 snowballs and builds them continuously. Since Jay builds 20 snowballs in the first hour, and 2 melt every 15 minutes (or 8 in an hour), he will have 12 snowballs after the first hour. We can subtract these from the total to find the remaining time:

Remaining snowballs = 60 - 12 = 48 snowballs

Time to build remaining snowballs = 48 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs/minute)
= 48 * 5 minutes
= 240 minutes

Adding the first hour (60 minutes) to this, we get:

Total time = 240 minutes + 60 minutes
= 300 minutes

Converting this to hours:

300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

However, we can also calculate the time in hours and minutes by considering the first hour separately:

Time = 1 hour + (48 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs/minute))

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age at that time.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to calculate the slices eaten by each person and add them together.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add the slices eaten by each person: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6.

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means that before the third day's order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages. So, before the first day's order, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left from the second day, and 31 + 38 = 69 bandages used and left from the first day.

Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. Since the haircut costs $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, the total length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost is $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is:
$270 + $40 = $310

Blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * Blood in a shark
Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of each bottle of scotch and then the cost of each bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, which is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on each day:
Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be translated into the equation 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression equals 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8."

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set had 6 colors, she used up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, the height of the second floor will be the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor. However, we are asked to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is the same as the height of the second floor.

"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine and add it to the amount of the first medicine. 

The amount of the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

The total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school
= 120 + 30

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 borrowed, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount owed is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

To find the amount he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount owed: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find the number of red jelly beans he estimated.

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height:
Volume = base area * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is:
Effective volume = Volume * 0.8
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar:
Total jelly beans = Effective volume / volume of a single jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since Tim estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans he estimated is:
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find the difference between Tim's guess and the true number, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:
Difference = True number - Estimated number
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

In the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next 3 years, Pauline continued to visit the museum 3 times a year, and the new cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and divide them into groups of 8.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students each who get to try the escape room. 
Total students = 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total students / 8 students/group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Each group uses 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time required, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group.
Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

The final answer is: 225"

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4 * 8

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs. 

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs (80) by the number of meatballs per pound (16) to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, and there are five people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is calculated as 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the sum of the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount and the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Next, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year, so we add that to the total:
36 issues/year + 6 issues/year = 42 issues/year

Lastly, the last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is:

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to first determine the number of paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the following equation:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = Shelley's paintings - 12

To find Shelley's paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, and Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, a single bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books she has (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55).

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work and then divide that by the time it takes to deal with a single call.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work in a day:
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total number of minutes he spends at work in a week is:
360 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1800 minutes/week

Now, let's divide the total number of minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call:
1800 minutes/week / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week

"To find the difference in drying time, we first need to calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using both the old and new varnishes.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
6 paintings * 7 minutes/painting = 42 minutes

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
6 paintings * 12 minutes/painting = 72 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in drying time between the new and old varnishes:
Difference in drying time = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
= 72 minutes - 42 minutes
= 30 minutes

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so they need 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so they need 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.

The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have already been accounted for, the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, we add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

The total distance Phineas needs to cover is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Total time taken to return home = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

First, we need to find the total number of doughnuts made per day. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of doughnuts made per day is:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts sold per day is also 120.

Next, we need to find the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts sold in June:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

"To determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His initial speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his initial speed by 2.5:

New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speaking speed:

Time = Total words / New speaking speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then sum them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people was 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the total number of people was 2 * 70 = 140.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since it's an average, we can assume the number of people was the same each day, so the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's sum up the number of people Conor saw each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 500"
"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add the number of kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the number of lemons required for the regular gallons of lemonade and then the number of lemons required for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.

For the regular gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons required for the regular gallons is:
4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons required for the extra gallon is:
2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

The total number of lemons required is the sum of the lemons needed for the regular gallons and the extra gallon:
24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons

Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2 depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3 depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, the number of pink candies is the difference between the total number of candies and the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

$80 * 3 = $240

The cost of each bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is:
$80 * 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is:

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the two children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture and then subtract that from the total revenue.

The cost of making 1 jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of special honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The total cost of making 10 jars is: 10 * $44 = $440

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is: 10 * $50 = $500

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $500 - $440 = $60

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in 2 weeks and multiply it by the number of cars he services per day, then multiply that by his pay per car.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 2 weeks is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's average enrollment as follows:

Butler High School's average enrollment = (3/4) * Norman High School's average enrollment
Butler High School's average enrollment = (3/4) * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

Difference in average enrollment = Norman High School's average enrollment - Butler High School's average enrollment
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered. Since he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, and Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which was 14. So, he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

We know that Igor gathered 7 beakers initially, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers he lost as x. Then, the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, Petri dishes, and beakers. We are given that this total is 29. So, we can set up the equation:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + (7 - x) (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:

24 + (7 - x) = 29

Combine like terms:

31 - x = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:

-x = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket = 10
Number of eggs in the second basket = 2 * 10 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of eggs in both baskets by adding the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20
Total number of eggs = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

Distance Vanessa ran = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
4 miles = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can set up a proportion to find the time it would take Vanessa to run 2 miles:

Time Aaron ran 2 miles / Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = Speed ratio
16 minutes / Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 2
Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 16 minutes / 2
Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 8 minutes

However, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she runs at a constant speed, we can multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2:

Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * Time Vanessa ran 2 miles
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * 8 minutes
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 16 minutes

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 200 feet * 3 = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total line required to find out how much more line he needs to buy.

Line to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line to buy = 600 feet - 6 feet
Line to buy = 594 feet

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price of each watermelon and then apply the 25% profit.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we apply the 25% profit to the cost price to find the selling price.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first determine the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate Dora's current age. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so the current age of John is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, the current age of the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 30 / 2
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.
