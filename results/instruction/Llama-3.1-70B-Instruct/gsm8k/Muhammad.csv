"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs she uses for herself and her friends:
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Now, let's subtract the total eggs used from the total eggs laid:
Total eggs laid: 16
Total eggs used: 7
Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9

Now, let's calculate the total amount she makes by selling the eggs:
Eggs left to sell: 9
Price per egg: $2
Total amount made: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000. But the repairs cost $50,000, so the new value is actually $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he runs in a week.

James runs 3 sprints a day, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a day is:
3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken gets per day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total amount of feed needed per day) - 40 (amount of feed given in the first two meals) = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows:
- The first and second glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third and fourth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth and sixth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh and eighth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The ninth and tenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eleventh and twelfth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The thirteenth and fourteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifteenth and sixteenth glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costing $8. 
The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first find the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep:
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla also spends 20 minutes on the Windows update. So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drove at 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance covered in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 3 hours at 60 mph before turning around. The distance he covered in those 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he covered in the 4 hours from the initial distance:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered in 4 hours = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

Since the total revenue is still less than the total cost at the end of year 5, we need to calculate for year 6. At the end of year 6, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108). 

However, if we calculate the revenue and cost for year 7 and year 8, we get:
Year 7: Total cost = $108 + $3 = $111, Total revenue = $63 + $10.50 = $73.50
Year 8: Total cost = $111 + $3 = $114, Total revenue = $73.50 + $10.50 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 + $3 = $117, Total revenue = $84 + $10.50 = $94.50
Year 10: Total cost = $117 + $3 = $120, Total revenue = $94.50 + $10.50 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 + $3 = $123, Total revenue = $105 + $10.50 = $115.50
Year 12: Total cost = $123 + $3 = $126, Total revenue = $115.50 + $10.50 = $126
Year 13: Total cost = $126 + $3 = $129, Total revenue = $126 + $10.50 = $136.50

At the end of year 13, the total revenue ($136.50) is greater than the total cost ($129), so it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green and red houses is x - (x/3 + 2), which simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2, or (x/3) - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green, red, and orange houses: x/3 + 2 + (x/3 - 1), which simplifies to (2x/3) + 1.

The number of vacuum cleaners left is x - ((2x/3) + 1), which simplifies to (x/3) - 1.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (x/3) - 1 = 5.

Solving for x, we get x/3 = 6, and x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Now, to convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. To complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa will need:

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour), so she has 6 miles remaining. She has also already used 2 hours, so she has 1 hour remaining to complete the hike.

The speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11 lego sets.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets.

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends:

Time running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance covered while running = Running speed * Time running
Distance covered while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance covered while running = 12 miles

Distance covered while walking = Walking speed * Time walking
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance covered while walking = 6 miles

Total distance covered = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking
Total distance covered = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance covered = 18 miles

"To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw three times farther, so the total distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, subtract the dragon's flame distance from the total throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Finally, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 articles is (2/5) * 5 = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is 80 + x - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we can add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Now, we can subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of each blue tie and add it to the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to find the total number of units in the building and then calculate 3/4 of that number to find the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

Total number of floors in the building: 15
Number of units per floor: 8
Total number of units in the building: 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Number of occupied units = (3/4) * 120
= 0.75 * 120
= 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
= 120 - 90

Eggs per week = 252 * 7 = 1764

Now, let's calculate the total number of dozens of eggs produced per week:
Dozens per week = 1764 / 12 = 147

Since Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, we can now calculate his weekly earnings:

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. This will give us the maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight of boxes / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

Now, let's subtract the stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find their combined weights, we need to first find Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:
3 * 25 = 75

Then, multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose:
75 * 8 = 600

Total number of thorns: 600"
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. 

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 22. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times the alarm rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase every year. 
After the first year, her monthly salary will be $600 + 10% of $600 = $600 + $60 = $660.
After the second year, her monthly salary will be $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726.
After the third year, her monthly salary will be $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary:
$798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each. There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.
Girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends, but since he only has water with 3 meals and before bed on both days, and only has soda with dinner on one of the days, we subtract 1 from the weekend total to account for the soda, so 7 - 1 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes). 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 90 / 30 = 3.

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies, so before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, we can set up the equation: 2x = 100, where x is the number of cookies he baked last year.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can calculate the distance she rows per second and then multiply it by the total time it took her to reach the shore.

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second
Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Total distance = 1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find the total amount of water taken on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply it by 2.

"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we need to first determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary four years ago = Lylah's salary four years ago + 30% of Lylah's salary four years ago
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase for Lylah. However, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase for Lylah. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, we will assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40% for the sake of calculation.

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons Julia had, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had before her husband bought the spoons.

7 (spoons Julia had before husband's purchase) + 3 (spoons used) = 10 spoons

Therefore, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to find the number of fish sausages first. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to find out how many friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to first calculate the total time spent by the doctors and then the total cost to the hospital and the total revenue from the patients.

Total patients per day: 500
Average time per patient: 24 minutes
Total time spent by doctors per day: 500 * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Cost to the hospital per hour: $150
Total cost to the hospital per day: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Revenue from patients per hour: $200
Total revenue from patients per day: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Profit made by the hospital per day: Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to calculate Joseph's expenditure in June and then add it to his expenditure in May.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. 
In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides and multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam) + 6 (Fred) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We know that Walt's total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400."

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) on a six-sided die. To roll two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities:

P(even) × P(even) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities:

P(>3) - P(even × even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.25 × 100 = 25%

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters from the total straw given to the rats and hamsters to find the straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is:
22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

Then, Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is:
6 (bags) * 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is:
2 (bags) * 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of blue and red pens she bought:
32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of the 5 highest scores.

There are 6 tests in total, but the lowest score will be removed, so we will consider 5 tests for the average. The desired average is 93.

Total score needed for an average of 93 = Desired average * 5
Total score needed = 93 * 5
Total score needed = 465

Now, let's calculate the total score Brinley has so far, excluding the lowest score. We will exclude the lowest score of 71.

Total score so far = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86
Total score so far = 367

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to reach the total score of 465, considering that the lowest score of 71 will be removed and the new lowest score will be the one that will be removed.

Since the lowest score of 71 will be removed, we will consider the new total score with the 5 highest scores, including the score on the sixth test.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as x.

New total score = Total score so far + x
New total score = 367 + x

Since the new total score should be equal to the total score needed, we can set up the equation:

367 + x = 465

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 465 - 367
x = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers for the first four weeks and the last three weeks separately, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. 
So, in one week, he rode 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
In four weeks, he rode 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time.
So, in one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
In three weeks, he rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the last three weeks to get the total kilometers.
Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

The total cost of buying each cup is $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The total amount is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount = $2000
Additional amount = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount = Initial amount + Additional amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's find Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she paid from the total amount she owes:
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish)

Simplifying the equation: 
4 * (number of fish in each aquarium) = 28

Divide both sides by 4: 
number of fish in each aquarium = 28 / 4
number of fish in each aquarium = 7

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and multiply it by the hourly rate, then apply the discount.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for the entire movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake ingredients, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 
Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories her sister consumed = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. So, the initial 10 stalls with 20 cows each now have a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 (initial) + 2 (new) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight of the tree after the termites ate 30% of it.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

For the car in the slow lane, time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to calculate the points for each player first.

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not get an extra point.

Mike's new points: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim's new points: 18 points (no change).
Tony's new points: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

So, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the pages are paired in a way that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

This arrangement still results in 16 pieces of paper, since each piece of paper has a front and a back, and each page is paired with another page.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books and that she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in the three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the third year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his total hours worked, his hourly earnings, and his bonus.

There are approximately 4 weeks in April. Since Watson works 5 days a week, he works a total of 4 * 5 = 20 days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, so his total hours worked in April is 20 * 10 = 200 hours.

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total hourly earnings for April is 200 * $10 = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. For 4 weeks, his total bonus is 4 * $300 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for April is the sum of his hourly earnings and his bonus: $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find out how many loaves are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from ice cream and milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify, multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we don't know how many of the remaining employees are programmers. Let's assume the number of non-programmers is x. Then the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 - x = 60 - x.

However, we are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. This implies that senior programmers are paid $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and the amount paid to senior programmers.

Let's assume all the remaining employees (60) are programmers, then the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards of $1 each, totaling $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

Now, we subtract the coupon discount from the price after applying the rewards: $39 - $8 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the net income of Job B and Job A.
Difference = Net income of Job B - Net income of Job A = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names, as 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider Richard (or RJ) to have 1 gun.

So, the total number of guns is: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (Richard) + 5 (this is likely an error and we'll ignore it) = 19 guns.

Since there are 4 people, we'll divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many guns each of them would have: 19 / 4 = 4.75.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

c + 2c = 60
Combine like terms:
3c = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (c = 20), we can find the number of chickens:
Number of chickens = 2c = 2 * 20 = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs it has and add them together:
Total legs = (40 chickens * 2 legs) + (20 cows * 4 legs)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the following:

- The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Daily earnings = $1000/day

When the factory made silos:
Daily earnings = Number of silos sold per day * Price per silo
Daily earnings = 5 silos/day * $220/silo
Daily earnings = $1100/day

Now, we can calculate the percentage increase in daily earnings:
Percentage increase = ((New earnings - Old earnings) / Old earnings) * 100
Percentage increase = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children.

A dozen bread rolls is equal to 12 rolls. She fed 6 rolls to her children, so the number of rolls left is:
12 - 6 = 6 rolls

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:
6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to first determine the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

The rest of the pupils like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks Lindsay washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months = 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount ≈ $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, so the total number of pesos he has is 50 + 80 = 130.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. The total number of pesos Anna has is 100 + 120 = 220.

Now, let's add the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together: 130 + 220 = 350.

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12 gifts) to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Inches of ribbon per gift bow = Total inches of ribbon / Total gifts
Inches of ribbon per gift bow = 144 / 12

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of each part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we multiply the value of each part by the respective ratio to find the number of popsicles each of them has. 
Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is 2 * $10 * 0.8 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he saves by cancelling his $60 cable package. 
The amount of money he saves is $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then add the slices eaten by Jenny, and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

The total number of slices taken is 7 (Bill and Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices.

Now, subtract the total slices taken from the total number of slices: 12 - 9 = 3.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. Since Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy used in a day is:

Energy = Power * Time
Energy = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy used in a day is:

Energy = Power * Time
Energy = 900 watts * 3 hours
Energy = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

The energy saved in a day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used:
Energy saved = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the energy saved in 30 days, multiply the energy saved in a day by 30:

The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. We can isolate 'c' in the second equation:
c = 180 - d

Substituting this expression for 'c' in the first equation:
2(180 - d) + d = 304
360 - 2d + d = 304
360 - d = 304
d = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
Size of Zack's locker = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Size of Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker
Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Size of Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. 

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months at $14 per month.
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer will be negative.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny went to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100. This means he spent the money he earned from selling the cards on the ticket. So, the amount he earned from selling the cards is $100 (ticket) - $50 (spending cash) = $50.

Since Kenny sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the amount he earned ($50) by the price per card ($1.5). 

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

We know Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards. Let's assume the total number of cards he started with is x. Then, the number of cards he kept is x/3, and the number of cards he sold is 2x/3 (since he sold 2/3 of his cards).

We already know that Kenny sold 33 cards. So, we can set up the equation:

2x/3 = 33

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of cards Kenny started with: 50"
"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he actually spent is:
$5 - (1% of $5) = $5 - $0.05 = $4.95

Now, subtract the amount he spent on chips from the total amount he spent:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:

2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length.

Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

- Run: 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes = 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- Bike ride: 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the run:

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 x $5

Then, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. These 25 fairies joined the initial 50 fairies, so the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75.

After that, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the feed together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

To find the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

Number of basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards
Total number of cards = 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are given to her students.
Number of cards given to students = 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since she received a $1 discount, we need to subtract $1 (100 cents) from the total cost. So, Becky paid 900 - 100 = 800 cents.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since she received a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of 1000 cents, which is 0.1 * 1000 = 100 cents. So, Kelly paid 1000 - 100 = 900 cents.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. Kelly paid 900 cents, and Becky paid 800 cents. The difference is 900 - 800 = 100 cents.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got:
200 (initial) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from 300:

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, let's break down the information given. 

Matt wants 5 cookies in total. He gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, so the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks is 5 - 2 = 3 cookies.

Since Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up an equation: 
Number of carrot sticks / 2 = 3 cookies

To find the number of carrot sticks, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
Number of carrot sticks = 3 * 2
Number of carrot sticks = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to determine the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total number of students.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

(1/4) * Total number of students = 20

To find the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total number of students = 20 * 4
Total number of students = 80

Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available is:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

The total walking time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we divide the total walking time by the number of days:

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we need to subtract 3 from the sum of 9 and 6 to avoid double-counting.

Number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Morning rides: 14 days * 1 ride/day * $6/ride = 14 * 1 * 6 = $84
Afternoon rides: 14 days * 1 ride/day * $2/ride = 14 * 1 * 2 = $28

Total cost = Morning rides cost + Afternoon rides cost
Total cost = $84 + $28
Total cost = $112

"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Number of guests: 10"
"To find out how many insects Lily found, we need to set up some equations based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
B + D + L = 43

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation:
D = B/2

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write the equation:
L = D + 7

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
L = B/2 + 7

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to get:
B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
B + B = 2B, and B/2 + B/2 = B
So, 2B + B + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
3B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
3B = 36

Divide both sides by 3:
B = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find out how many David found:
D = B/2
D = 12/2
D = 6

Now that we know David found 6 insects, we can find out how many Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 6 + 7
L = 13

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts she bought for her friends and the additional random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.
Total gifts for her friends = 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts.

Total gifts = 16 (for her friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

For 2 x 4 wood: 
- Cost per piece: $4
- Sticks per piece: 200
- Sticks per dollar: 200 / 4 = 50

For 2 x 8 wood: 
- Cost per piece: $6
- Sticks per piece: 400
- Sticks per dollar: 400 / 6 ≈ 66.67

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we'll use that for the calculation. However, we need to check if Frederick can afford a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24, and a 2 x 8 costs $6. 

Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy: 24 / 6 = 4

Total sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood: 4 * 400 = 1600

However, we need to check if buying 2 x 4 wood would give more sticks. 

Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy: 24 / 4 = 6

Total sticks from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood: 6 * 200 = 1200

Since 1600 is more than 1200, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 wood.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 200 days
= 525 calories/day

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's calculate the remaining money:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of the remaining money ($400) is:
25% * $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: 90,000"

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. However, the cost is per pack, not per bag. So, the total cost is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Tara sold the bags for $8 each. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find out how much he gave to his sister, and finally determine how much he spent on dinner.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the total number of rows, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips and then add them together.

For the red tulips, Jackson can fit 6 tulips in a row. He has 36 red tulips, so the number of rows of red tulips is 36 / 6 = 6.

For the blue tulips, Jackson can fit 8 tulips in a row. He has 24 blue tulips, so the number of rows of blue tulips is 24 / 8 = 3.

The total number of rows is the sum of the rows of red and blue tulips, which is 6 + 3 = 9.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we will divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for cookies = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make, we will divide the cups of raisins for cookies by the amount of raisins per batch.

Number of batches = 9 cups / (3/4 cup) 
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction.
Number of batches = 9 cups * (4/3) 
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts/week - 2016 kilowatts/week = 336 kilowatts/week.

Since a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is 336 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time to paint half a house).

Now, if we have 5 people painting the house, the total time it would take to paint the whole house would be:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

The total cost of the items Tom bought is $48. The cost of the CD is $4. 

Cost of the headphone set = Total cost - Cost of the CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Cost of the headphone set / Cost of the CD
Number of CDs = $44 / $4
Number of CDs = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and add the hours spent in the weeks with the exceptions.

Josh spent 4 hours per week for 8 weeks, except for 3 weeks. So, he spent 4 hours per week for 5 weeks. 
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

For 2 consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each week. 
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For 1 week, he spent 6 hours. 

Now, we add the hours spent in all the weeks to find the total number of hours.

"To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame is currently 22 years old, in 8 years, he will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is half the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then calculate the total number of seashells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, each group has 20 / 2 = 10 kids. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells the boys brought is 10 * 60 = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is 3000 / 10 = 300.

Initial candies George had = 3 (candies left) + 5 (candies eaten) = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had by multiplying the initial number of candies George had by 2.

Candies Nick has = 2 * 8 = 16

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first and second half.

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. April has 30 days. 

Let's assume the daily savings for the first half is 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings for the second half will be '2x'.

The first half of the month has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days. 

The total savings for the month can be represented as:
15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since the daily savings for the second half is '2x', we multiply 'x' by 2:
2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume the time for warm water is the same as for hot water, as no other information is given.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate, then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, Cody and Trevor ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, let's subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then find the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up an equation to find the nephew's age in 7 years: 
51 = 3 * nephew's age in 7 years

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Now, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from the nephew's age in 7 years:
nephew's current age = 17 - 7
nephew's current age = 10

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then add them to Richie's score.

Richie scored 80 goals, which is 45 more than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Now, let's add the goals scored by all three teenagers:
Richie's goals: 80
Mark's goals: 60
Anna's goals: 35
Total goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's total earnings. Since Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade.

Mitchell's earnings = 21 lemonades * $4 per lemonade = $84

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference.

Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
= $84 - $63

"To find out how many action figures Peter can buy, we first need to determine how much he spent from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day for a week, we divide his total money by 7.

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent $10 per day for 4 days on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.

$10 per day * 4 days = $40 spent on wooden action figures

Number of wooden action figures bought = $40 / $5 per action figure = 8

Now, we need to find out how much he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

$70 - $40 = $30

Since he has $10 per day for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend $10 * 3 = $30 on plastic action figures.

Number of plastic action figures bought = $30 / $2 per action figure = 15

Total action figures = 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
260 roses/month (ordered) - 160 roses/month (grown) = 100 roses/month

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will remove in 2 years and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 * $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will remove from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the selling price.

First, let's find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we assume each crayon can be broken down into multiple small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon is not given. For the sake of calculation, let's assume each crayon can be broken down into 8 small pieces (this is a reasonable assumption since 8 small pieces are used to make one muffin crayon). 
So, the total number of small pieces is:
192 crayons * 8 small pieces/crayon = 1536 small pieces

Now, let's find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make:
Each muffin crayon requires 8 small pieces, so:
1536 small pieces / 8 small pieces/muffin crayon = 192 muffin crayons

Finally, let's calculate how much money Kate can make:
192 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $288

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On day three, he saw 0 birds. 
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. 
On day six, he saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

The starting value is 20. 
Half of the number is 20 / 2 = 10. 
The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30. 
This value is then divided by 5, resulting in 30 / 5 = 6. 
The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. 
So, the final value is 6 * 8 = 48.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give us an actual temperature of 520, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature is 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Now, divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Total time:

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy had brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes

Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = 52 + 68 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. Each box is $100.00, but it's currently 10% off. So, the discount is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. The cost of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. The cost of 2 boxes is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts. Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, we need to divide the total number of contacts by 2. 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts.

The cost of each pair of contacts is the total cost of 2 boxes divided by the total number of pairs of contacts. $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit, which is 100 ml. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the initial typing speed, the typing speed after the first increase, and the typing speed after the second increase, then divide by 3.

Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
Typing speed after the first increase: 52 WPM
Typing speed after the second increase: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, we add the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Then, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:
8.75 pounds (gained) - (-6.25 pounds) (lost) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is:
100 (initial invitees) + 100 * 2 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, let's consider the people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, as she will also be attending the event. So, the total number of seats needed is:
318 (total attendees) + 1 (Alex) = 319

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8. The total cost on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon: $21 - $20 = $1.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles to 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles to 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles to 32 feet tall.

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk will be taller than the window on the 4th day.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can calculate the protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the protein per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the angles.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:

- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply the amount Ruiz makes in 1 hour by 12 to find the total amount he makes in 12 hours:
60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find the amount Marissa makes in 1 hour:
(3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply the amount Marissa makes in 1 hour by 12 to find the total amount she makes in 12 hours:
90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Joe has $50, and he spends $42 on the outfit. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the outfit from his initial amount: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

Initial 5 months: 
The initial funding is $100,000 for 5 months. This means the monthly funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Additional months: 
The research took 10 times the initial duration, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months. However, we need to subtract the initial 5 months, so the additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The funding for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Initial 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000
Additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000
Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

Total ounces of meat consumed by the team:

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which is 2 loads per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:
2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per year is:
104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry per year is:

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.30 = $7,500

The profit from selling each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are:

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders by 0.25.

Total riders = 100
Riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the number of riders who can stay upright by 0.6.

Women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we find the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Men who can stay upright = Riders who can stay upright - Women who can stay upright

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding their individual prices.

5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

However, the bonus is not a regular monthly income, so we should calculate the total yearly income by multiplying the new monthly salary by 12 and then adding the bonus.

Total yearly income = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500 = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write the equation as 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin. T = t + 7, so T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. 
3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. 
The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
The cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 
The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. 
The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:
Neil's savings = Rong's savings + (2/5 * Rong's savings)
Neil's savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings = 20 + 8
Neil's savings = 28 coins per month

Now, we need to calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = Rong's savings per month * 120
Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400 coins

Neil's total savings = Neil's savings per month * 120
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
Neil's total savings = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
Total coins = 2400 + 3360
Total coins = 5760

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

The total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has. 

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

So, the total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which is 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raise per hour by dividing $2100 by 3 hours. This gives us $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 by dividing $4200 by $700 per hour. This gives us $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the 3 hours they have already fundraised.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to find the total number of blue spools and divide it by the total number of spools, then multiply by 100.

Total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 + 45
Total blue spools = 60

Total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
Total spools = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores.
6 adults want 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores.
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed.
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate it as 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A's votes can be calculated as:
20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B got 150% of candidate A's votes, or 1.5 times candidate A's votes:
1.5 * 20 = 30 votes

Now, we can find the total number of votes received by candidates A and B:
20 (A) + 30 (B) = 50 votes

Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes candidate C received can be found by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters:

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we first need to determine the number of books Steven and Alice have. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16

"To find the number of groups needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get the number of students per group.

54 / 6 = 9 students per group

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, given that each group should have 9 students.

54 / 9 = 6 groups

The activity requires 12 groups, but we can only form 6 groups with 54 students. Therefore, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

12 (required groups) - 6 (groups that can be formed) = 6

However, the question asks for the number of more groups needed to form, given that the activity requires 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, we need to find the number of additional groups that can be formed if more students were available.

But since the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form, given that the activity requires 12 groups, and we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, the answer is simply the difference between the required groups and the groups that can be formed.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She still has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She still has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers.

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Remaining time = Total time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the number of pencils he gave away to Brandon and Charlie.

Anthony had 50 pencils initially. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time spent = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles. 

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost of movies in series = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5. Let's calculate the number of older movies:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of these movies will be:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10. Let's calculate the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of these movies will be:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, let's add up the cost of all the movies:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

The final answer is: $3534"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. The family drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. 

Distance driven = Speed * Time 
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5 
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. The family hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Distance hiked = Speed * Time 
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5 
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance to the vacation spot.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked 
Total distance = 225 + 30 
Total distance = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma: 30z
Points from time for Ava: 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:

Total points for Emma: 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava: (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava: 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores is the difference between their total points:
Difference = Total points for Ava - Total points for Emma
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = -25

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but since it is stated that two pizzas cost 30 dollars, we can assume that the two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total, not each). So the two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total.

Now, subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas: 
64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides on the usual days and the number of rides on the extra days.

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

On the extra days (2 days), they ride twice the usual number of times, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

The total number of rides in a week is the sum of the rides on the usual days and the extra days: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought 17 fish in total, the number of orange fish he bought would be 17 - x.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying the new fish, he had a total of (3 + (17 - x)) orange fish and (4 + x) white fish.

According to the problem, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish. We can set up the equation:

(3 + (17 - x)) = 2 * (4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 3x

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and the total amount of gas he uses. 

Since Andy only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the total distance he travels in a day is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles. 

In a week, he travels 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

The amount spent from the quarters is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

The amount spent from the twenties is 3/5 of 10 twenties. First, we find 3/5 of 10:
3/5 * 10 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees. To find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised, we subtract the nighttime temperature from 32 degrees.

Degrees to be raised = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the degrees to be raised by the heat provided by each log.

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth graders', it is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

Total number of branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total number of branches = $105 / $0.25
Total number of branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average number of branches per day = Total number of branches / 7
Average number of branches per day = 420 / 7
Average number of branches per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 

14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. We can write an equation to represent this:

z (zest) + z (fragrance) + 2z (salt) + 2z (sugar) + 4z (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

z = 1

Now that we know z is 1, we can find the amount of oil:

Amount of oil = 4z
Amount of oil = 4 * 1
Amount of oil = 4

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold: Joe sold 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother: Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gave away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left: Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted red food baskets to get the total cost: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms, one-half of the rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total for the three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

I am 2 years older than my sister, so:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as 'M'. 
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. 
A + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for A and M in terms of B into the equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
6B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
6B = 96

Divide by 6:
B = 16

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age:
A = B - 3
A = 16 - 3
A = 13

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / 8 glue sticks/pack = 54 / 8 = 6.75

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so A + S + F = 85.

Substituting S and A in terms of F, we get (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we get F - 12 + F + 13 + F = 85.

This simplifies to 3F + 1 = 85.

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles. 
So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance.
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel's pages from yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in terms of child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours a day, the total number of packages he completes in a day is 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Colby earns $0.20 per package, so his total earnings in a day are 320 * 0.20 = 64 dollars.

First, we find the time taken for the extreme sudoku puzzle: 
Time for a normal sudoku puzzle = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. So, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. 

Number of yellow balloons = 18 / 3 = 6

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John).

We are also given that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

We can substitute L = J + 10 into P = L + J to get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Now, we can substitute P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into P + L + J = 100 to get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms to get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides to get 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4 to get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

2. Labor charge: Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of hours, as the problem states ""or part thereof."" So, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for after the discount, and the amount he sold the 5 CDs for.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: 
$90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 
Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide by 3: A = 5.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches, which is 1.5 inches. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15, which is 60.

Now, we multiply the number of 15-minute intervals (60) by the number of reports stapled per interval (30).

60 * 30 = 1800

The total number of reports stapled is 1800."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to calculate the total time she would have slept if she had woken up at her usual time. 

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

So, the total minutes she slept on her bed that day is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, the total number of occupied beds = 200 (initial) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds
The total number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. We can calculate Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, to find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

Number of holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes at the end of the fourth day - Total holes at the end of the third day

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first leg = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last leg = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total southerly distance to get the actual distance between the two homes.

Distance between the bird's northern and southern homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant to find out how many plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 45 plants.

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backwards.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we first need to find the number of flights the second plane makes and then double it. The second plane makes 44 trips, so the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, it goes to Greece 88 * 3/4 = 66 times. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute H into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. So, the total amount collected from these sources is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

Three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church. 

There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by 15. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is 2 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 6 slices.

The total size of all slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the size of each adult's slice by the total size of all slices and multiplying by 100:

Percentage for each adult = (2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

The cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $40 per session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

Total number of babies born in a year = 48 babies/year * 30 female porcupines
Total number of babies born in a year = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the total number of babies born in a year:

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end was 28%, we can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 3 hours as follows:

Let x be the charge at the beginning of the 3 hours.
x - 3 * 7% = 28%
x - 0.21x = 0.28
0.79x = 0.28
x = 0.28 / 0.79
x = 0.354 or 35.4%

Now, let's go back to the first 5 hours, when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. We know that the charge at the end of these 5 hours was 35.4%. We can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 5 hours as follows:

Let y be the charge at the beginning of the 5 hours.
y - 5 * 9% = 35.4%
y - 0.45y = 0.354
0.55y = 0.354

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, then multiply it by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the first two packages and then apply it to the third package.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be $1.5. 

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000. 
He pays $1000 from selling his old bedroom set, so the remaining amount is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we calculate 10% of $2000.
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework is 50%.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each bottle:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

Total apples = 2 * 40
Total apples = 80

Now, we know Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both amounts separately.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate the number of years it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to the length and 2 feet to the width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the new length and new width.

Area of one piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we'll subtract that from the total losses.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

There were 3 races in total. To find the average amount lost, we'll divide the total amount lost by the number of races.

"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the share of the first person as 'x'. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is 'x + 80'. 

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is '2(x + 80)'.

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine 'x' terms and constants:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team in a day. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day, we can convert this fraction to hours by multiplying it by the total hours in a day (24 hours).

3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours per day

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters in the team, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Initial price of the car = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Depreciation for the first year (2007-2008) = 21% of $20000 = 0.21 * $20000 = $4200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Depreciation for the second year (2008-2009) = 21% of $15800 = 0.21 * $15800 = $3318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15800 - $3318 = $12482

Depreciation for the third year (2009-2010) = 21% of $12482 = 0.21 * $12482 = $2620.42

700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:
35 + 210 = 245 dollars

"To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of successful trucks by the tons of fertiliser per truck to find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

"To make 6 dozen croissants, Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. The promotion at the grocery store is buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for one pound at full price ($4.00) and the second pound at half price ($2.00). 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will have three sets of two pounds. For each set, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. For three sets, he will pay 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then determine the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of people invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is:
45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there is an additional $6 for each guest beyond 20. The number of additional guests is:
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 * $6 = $126

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide this by 7 to find the total bananas eaten in a day: 
315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day:
45 bananas - 24 bananas = 21 bananas.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves at 125 minutes as well.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we will calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Growth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the total number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the sold bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450. 

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- MTB: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 * $450 = $67,500

"To find the total hours John spends learning in a week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1600 / 60 = 26.67 hours.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2/16 of his weekly minutes. So, the extra learning time is 2/16 * 10080 = 1260 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1260 / 60 = 21 hours.

However, this is the total extra time for both Saturday and Sunday. Since the question asks for the total hours spent learning in a week, we should add the class time and the extra learning time. But the extra time is already included in the weekly minutes, so we should only add the class time and the extra time that is not part of the class time. The extra time is 1/16 of the weekly minutes, and the class time is 1600 minutes, so the extra time that is not part of the class time is 1260 - (10080 - 1600) * 1/16 = 1260 - 846 = 414 minutes for both Saturday and Sunday, which is 414 / 60 = 6.9 hours.

However, the question asks for the total hours spent learning in a week, so we should add the class time and the extra learning time that is not part of the class time. The total hours spent learning in a week is 26.67 + 6.9 = 33.57 hours.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she needs to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she wants to retire in 20 years, we can calculate the number of years she has already worked as follows:

Number of years already worked = Total years to reach goal - Years until retirement
= 40 years - 20 years
= 20 years

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. The question asks how many more years Lauren needs to work. Since she needs to work for 40 years in total and wants to retire in 20 years, she needs to work for the remaining years.

Number of years she needs to work = Total years to reach goal - Years until retirement
= 40 years - 20 years
= 20 years

However, this is the number of years she needs to work from now until retirement. The question asks how many more years she needs to work, implying she has already worked for some years. Since we don't know how many years she has already worked, we can't give an exact answer. However, assuming she has worked for some years and has some savings, we can't calculate the exact number of years she needs to work.

However, if we assume she has no savings and starts saving from now, she needs to work for 40 years to reach her goal, and she wants to retire in 20 years, so she needs to work for 20 years from now.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the given percentage and number of boys. 

Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total students = 240
0.4 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of women.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300 miles in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract her planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles per day she must hike: 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
To do this, we divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

First, we find the distance of the one-way trip. Since distance = speed * time, and the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, the distance of the one-way trip is:
70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
140 miles * 2 = 280 miles per round trip

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: Elijah's first dog (15 pounds) + Elijah's second dog (30 pounds) + Kory's dog (60 pounds) = 105 pounds.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's assume Sarah painted 'x' eggs. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation as:
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together all four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by the number of crayons per box (8). 

200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to get the total weight: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 's'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is '2s'.

We know that time = distance / speed. Since Grandma spends 40 minutes on the beach, we can set up the equation:

40 = 2 / s

To find 's', we can rearrange the equation:

s = 2 / 40
s = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on sidewalk = distance / speed
Time on sidewalk = 1 / (2 * (1/20))
Time on sidewalk = 1 / (1/10)
Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. To draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. To draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day, we need to find the most efficient way to complete the project. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. However, this is not the correct answer because it is the LCM of the days, not the actual days it will take to complete the project.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of each type of picture scene by the number of each type of picture scene Lauren can draw per day, and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.

9 days for large-sized picture scenes, 6 days for medium-sized picture scenes, and 7 days for small-sized picture scenes. 

However, Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days. So, we can add the total number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene, but we need to consider that some days can be used to work on different types of picture scenes.

One way to do this is to first calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the large-sized and medium-sized picture scenes. The total number of days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes is 9 days, and the total number of days it will take to complete the medium-sized picture scenes is 6 days. 

Since Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days, we can use the 9 days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes to also work on the medium-sized picture scenes. In 9 days, Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes and 9 x 6 = 54 medium-sized picture scenes, but she only needs to complete 36 medium-sized picture scenes. 

So, in 9 days, Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes and the 36 medium-sized picture scenes. 

Now, we need to calculate the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the 49 small-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days to complete the small-sized picture scenes.

Since Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days, we can use some of the 9 days it will take to complete the large-sized and medium-sized picture scenes to also work on the small-sized picture scenes. 

In 7 days, Lauren can complete the 49 small-sized picture scenes, and she can use the remaining 2 days to work on the large-sized and medium-sized picture scenes. 

However, Lauren has already completed the large-sized and medium-sized picture scenes in 9 days, so she does not need the extra 2 days.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project is the maximum of the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene. 

The maximum of 9 days and 7 days is 9 days, but we need to consider that Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days.

One way to do this is to first calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes and the medium-sized picture scenes, which is 9 days. 

Then, we can use some of the 9 days to work on the small-sized picture scenes. In 9 days, Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes and the 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and she can also complete 9 x 7 = 63 small-sized picture scenes, but she only needs to complete 49 small-sized picture scenes.

So, in 9 days, Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes, the 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and the 49 small-sized picture scenes, but she will have 14 extra small-sized picture scenes.

However, this is not possible because Lauren can only draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, and she needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to first calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes and the small-sized picture scenes. 

The total number of days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes is 9 days, and the total number of days it will take to complete the small-sized picture scenes is 7 days.

Since Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days, we can use some of the 9 days to work on the small-sized picture scenes. 

In 7 days, Lauren can complete the 49 small-sized picture scenes, and she can use the remaining 2 days to work on the large-sized picture scenes.

However, Lauren has not completed the large-sized picture scenes in 7 days, so she needs more days to complete the large-sized picture scenes.

Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes in 9 days, and she can complete the 49 small-sized picture scenes in 7 days.

Since Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes on different days, we can use some of the 9 days to work on the small-sized picture scenes.

In 7 days, Lauren can complete the 49 small-sized picture scenes, and she can use the remaining 2 days to work on the large-sized picture scenes, but she still needs 2 more days to complete the large-sized picture scenes.

However, Lauren can also work on the medium-sized picture scenes in the 9 days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes.

So, in 9 days, Lauren can complete the 45 large-sized picture scenes and the 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and she can use some of the 9 days to work on the small-sized picture scenes.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first find the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. This is done by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total. 

We know Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on weekends.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

The total cost price of the devices is 6 * $20 = $120.

The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price of the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to meet the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need:
100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

Now, to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400.
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we have the total number of apartments: 400 (first two complexes) + 640 (last complex) = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. So, the total payment per week is:

- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. It produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Divide both sides by -5:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

Total paint used = 12 pints
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints
Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the non-yellow paint by 3.

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:

"To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods we get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so the remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 50 - 10 = 40.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. 
The remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 40 - 20 = 20.

The total amount of money he has now is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. 
The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
Total goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk. 
20% of the original 5 inches is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the chalk until it is 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk that can be used before it needs to be recycled.

Now, we can divide the remaining usable chalk (0.75 inches) by the amount used per day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of days before the chalk needs to be recycled, so we round up to the nearest whole number. 
0.75 days is less than 1 day, but since the teacher can use the chalk for part of the day, we round up to 1 day and add the 2 days from the 2.75 days calculated earlier.

The teacher has 2 + 1 = 3 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk, but on the 3rd day, the chalk will be too small to use, so the teacher will have to recycle it on that day. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 3 days, but the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle it.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes and then divide it by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the total number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we need to find out the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then subtract the amount he got to keep.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is 4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000.

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, the amount of milk that was returned is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

The amount Mr. Marcellus got to keep is 4000 - 1600 = 2400 gallons.

The refund amount is the cost of the returned milk, which is 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

Colin is 20 years old now."
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per dollar as follows:
100 books / $500 = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we can calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000:
0.2 books per dollar * $27000 = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can calculate the number of books per school as follows:
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

2. After throwing the apple at the tree, 5 more apples fell. He picked them up, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. Now, he had 1 (initial) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.

3. After throwing the apple at the tree, 6 more apples fell. He picked them up and went home. Now, he had 5 (already in his pocket) + 6 (newly picked) = 11 apples.

So, Newton brought home 11 apples."

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15: 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay's snowballs accumulate. To do this, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 snowballs per minute - 2/15 snowballs per minute = (5/15 - 2/15) snowballs per minute = 3/15 snowballs per minute = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net accumulation rate to find the time it will take: 
60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute) = 60 * 5 minutes = 300 minutes.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages.

So, before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had 103 + 28 + 38 = 169 bandages. Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they had 169 - 50 = 119 bandages initially.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons they had initially. 

There were 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. 
Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. 
So, the number of balloons they threw = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left.
Number of balloons they threw = 300 - 12 = 288.

"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine first. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3.

Amount of the second medicine = 14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we add the amount of the first medicine to the amount of the second medicine to get the total amount in one dose.

Total amount in one dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the total amount in one dose by 8.

Total amount in 8 doses = 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

The total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. 

Now, we can calculate the combined capacity of both schools:

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school
= 120 + 30
= 150

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount he owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean. The total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is:
20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is:
3/4 * 40 = 30

So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is:
60 (previous) + 30 (second stop) = 90

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third station is:
90 * 2 = 180

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
200 (capacity) - 180 (current) = 20

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is 30 + 45 = $75.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces will be equal to the total length of the board.

We can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning he will need.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. 

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
b = 3c - 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:
c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:
4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:
4c = 12

Divide by 4:
c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water needed for each group of plants and then add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, the rest is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. So, 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the distance on land and in water separately, then add them together.

The total distance is 200 yards, with half on land and half in water. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. 

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are 4 additional phones. So, the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones. 
Total cost = $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of doughnuts per day is:
10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

2. Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts sold per day is also 120.

3. The price per doughnut is $2, so the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is:
120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day

4. To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in June. June has 30 days, so:
$240/day * 30 days = $7200

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate his new speaking speed and the total number of words he needs to speak.

John's new speaking speed is 2.5 times his starting speed of 150 WPM. 
New speaking speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:
Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:
Time = Total words / New speaking speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes.

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, so the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

Total cookies after lunch = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Total cookies after giving to friends = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Total cookies after baking = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for each half of the collection and then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of the collection would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for this half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for this half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To fill in all 84 holes, Nate will need 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000
= 0.75 * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, let's subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

The number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to first determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes he gathered. 

Since Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, Petri dishes, and beakers. We know the total number of items is 29. Let's denote the number of beakers as B. 

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + B (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants: 
24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides: 
B = 5

Since Igor was supposed to gather 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how fast Vanessa ran. 

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance Vanessa did. So, Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find out how fast Aaron ran, we can calculate his speed as 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed. So, Vanessa's speed is (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute. To find out how long it took her to complete her part, we can calculate the time as 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3.

200 feet * 3 = 600 feet

This is the total amount of line required. However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total amount made per week is $90 * 2 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. 
Profit percentage is calculated on the cost price.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, we find John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The youngest son's current age is 5 years. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by dividing the second equation by 2 to simplify it:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.
