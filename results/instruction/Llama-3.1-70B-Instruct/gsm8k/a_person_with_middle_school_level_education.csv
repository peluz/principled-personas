"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to find out how many eggs she sells. 

First, let's find out how many eggs she uses for herself. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the eggs she uses from the total number of eggs her ducks lay. 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg. 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house was $80,000, and Josh put in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 100% (original value) + 150% (increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value of the house was $80,000. To find 250% of the original value, we multiply $80,000 by 2.5 (since 250% = 2.5). 

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the selling price to find the profit.

Profit = Selling price - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, so he runs 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters per sprint: 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she gives in total per day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total cups of feed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total cups of feed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses. Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, that's 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of pairs of glasses. 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.

For each pair, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3. So, the cost of each pair is 5 + 3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants 8 pairs, the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

However, we can also calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the second 8 glasses. The first 8 glasses cost 8 * 5 = $40. The second 8 glasses cost 8 * 3 = $24. The total cost is 40 + 24 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find out how many sheep each city has. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we need to add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep. 
Total number of sheep = 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"To find out how long it takes Carla to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so she downloads 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file, which takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

In total, Carla spends 40 minutes downloading the first part, 20 minutes on the restart, and 100 minutes downloading the entire file. So, the total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he didn't move because of the traffic, so the distance is 0 miles.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

So, the total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Initially, John drove 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Since he turned around, we need to subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the initial distance. Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles.

"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Her regular pay is for 40 hours at $10 per hour, so:
40 hours * $10 per hour = $400

She worked 5 hours overtime (45 hours - 40 hours). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so:
$10 per hour * 1.2 = $12 per hour
5 hours * $12 per hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and overtime pay:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. 
So, 3 * 60 = 180 downloads in the second month.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. 
To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. 
Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get the number of downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the number of downloads for each month to find the total number of downloads: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the yearly cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total earnings will be the number of lemons the tree grows per year (7 lemons) multiplied by the price of each lemon ($1.5).

Let's calculate the total earnings per year: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for the total earnings to be more than the total cost.

Year 1: Total cost = $90 + $3 = $93, Total earnings = $10.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 2: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 2 = $96, Total earnings = $10.5 * 2 = $21 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 3: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 3 = $99, Total earnings = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 4: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 4 = $102, Total earnings = $10.5 * 4 = $42 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 5: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 5 = $105, Total earnings = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 6: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 6 = $108, Total earnings = $10.5 * 6 = $63 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 7: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 7 = $111, Total earnings = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 8: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 8 = $114, Total earnings = $10.5 * 8 = $84 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 9: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 9 = $117, Total earnings = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 10: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 10 = $120, Total earnings = $10.5 * 10 = $105 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 11: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 11 = $123, Total earnings = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5 (Total cost > Total earnings)
Year 12: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 12 = $126, Total earnings = $10.5 * 12 = $126 (Total cost = Total earnings)
Year 13: Total cost = $90 + $3 * 13 = $129, Total earnings = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5 (Total cost < Total earnings)

It will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3.

Then she sold 2 more to the red house.

Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To solve this equation, let's simplify it:

(x - x/3 - 2) = 5 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x - x/3 - 2) = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

Expand the left side:

2x - 2x/3 - 4 = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

Combine like terms:

4x/3 - 4 = 8 + x - x/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

4x - 12 = 24 + 3x - x

Combine like terms:

4x - 3x = 24 + 12

x = 36

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners, but we need to check if this answer makes sense.

Let's go back to the beginning:

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is 36/3 = 12.

Then she sold 2 more to the red house.

Now, she has 36 - 12 - 2 = 22 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold 22/2 = 11 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 22 - 11 = 11 vacuum cleaners left, but we know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, our answer is not correct.

Let's go back to the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

We can try to solve it again.

(x - x/3 - 2) = 5 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x - x/3 - 2) = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

Expand the left side:

2x - 2x/3 - 4 = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

Combine like terms:

4x/3 - 4 = 8 + x - x/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

4x - 12 = 24 + 3x - x

Combine like terms:

4x - 3x = 24 + 12

x = 36

We got the same answer, but we know that it's not correct.

Let's try to solve it again.

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

We can try to simplify it:

(x - x/3 - 2) = 5 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2

(x - x/3 - 2) = 10/2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2

(x - x/3 - 2) = (10 + x - x/3 - 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x - x/3 - 2) = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

2x - 2x/3 - 4 = 10 + x - x/3 - 2

Combine like terms:

2x - 2x/3 - 4 = 8 + x - x/3

2x - x = 12 + x - 2x/3

x = 12 + x - 2x/3

x - x = 12 - 2x/3

-x/3 = 12 - x

x/3 = x - 12

x = 3x - 36

-2x = -36

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

Let's check if this answer makes sense.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is 18/3 = 6.

Then she sold 2 more to the red house.

Now, she has 18 - 6 - 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold 10/2 = 5 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 10 - 5 = 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Yes, this answer makes sense.

"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. 
20% of 20 is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 
25% of 16 is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students left who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000. 
To find 1.2% of $8,000, we multiply $8,000 by 0.012. 
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Now, we compare the increase in value for both options. 
The jewelry will increase by $125, and the electronic gadgets will increase by $96. 
Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, she eats 3 * 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 by 12 to get the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to find out how many points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25. 
4 * 0.25 = 1

So, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Now, we add the points from the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points.
4 + 5 = 9

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out how much that costs.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how much 1 yogurt costs, we divide $5.00 by 4. $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of 1 yogurt. 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to find out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should be equal to the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since he made $195 and spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x = $165 / $15 lego sets. 

$165 / $15 = 11

So, he sold 11 lego sets and still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he runs in total. He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours the second day and 1.5 hours the third day. 

Total hours = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and he runs 6 hours a week. To find out how many miles he runs per hour, we divide the total miles by the total hours.

Miles per hour = Total miles / Total hours
Miles per hour = 60 miles / 6 hours
Miles per hour = 10 miles per hour

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel, we need to find her running and walking speeds. 

We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, if we multiply her skipping speed by 2, we can find her running speed. 
3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour

Now we know Dana can run at 6 miles per hour. We also know she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, if we divide her running speed by 4, we can find her walking speed.
6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles/hour

Now we know Dana's running and walking speeds. We also know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has 6 hours, we can find the time she spends running and walking.
Time running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Now we can find the distance she travels running and walking.
Distance running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Now we can find the total distance she travels.
Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance = 18 miles

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. 

Distance outside the dragon's reach = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's reach

"To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to first find out how many pieces were there in total. Since Grandma Jones cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, we multiply 5 by 8.

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many were taken, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to find out how many calories you have left for the day and then how many servings of chips that is. 

You have 2000 calories as your target and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings of chips.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, 1 serving is 300 / 5 = 60 grams.

So, 0.8 servings is 0.8 * 60 = 48 grams.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the number of hours it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to figure out how many she used and then subtract that from the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. If she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, then the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is 23 (remaining) + 220 (used) = 243.

Now, we subtract the original 80 Post-it notes from the total to find out how many were in the package: 243 (total) - 80 (original) = 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find out how many blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find out how much John spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
Amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find out the total amount John spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Amount spent on blue ties + Amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we multiply 15 by 8.

15 * 8 = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

120 * 3/4 = 90 units

Since 90 units are occupied, the number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the occupied units.

120 - 90 = 30 units

Since Lloyd sells eggs per dozen, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen. 

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, we know Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen. 

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily income by 7.

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

"To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), we can find the distance by multiplying the speed and time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know Tom needs to travel 30 miles back at a rate of 6 mph. We can find the time it takes by dividing the distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He removes 30 comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each. 

First, we need to find out how much weight the comic books removed. 
30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds and the comic books removed 7.5 pounds, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to get 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday.
$520 - $480 = $40.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, let's add all the kittens together:

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
Since 18 is divisible by 2, Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each. 
9 * $1 = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the other price. 
Since 18 is divisible by 3, Vincent can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each. 
6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 * $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: 
$100 - $30 = $70.

"To find out how many liters of water were left, we need to first find out how much the girls got. 

Since there are 2 girls and each got 1/6 of the water, we need to find 1/6 of 24 liters first. 
1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. 
Since there are 2 girls, they got 2 * 4 = 8 liters in total.

Now, we subtract the water the girls got from the total amount of water. 
24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. 
So, we subtract 6 liters from 16 liters. 
16 - 6 = 10 liters.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to add the stickers he had and got, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie had 10 stickers initially. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 stickers for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is 9 + 28 = 37.

Now, we subtract the stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had: 54 - 37 = 17.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2. 

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. 
4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 500, so Alex's weight is 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we need to add their weights together to find their combined weight. 
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight 
Combined weight = 125 + 498

"Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games is 22. So, the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase each year.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
After 1 year, her salary will increase by 10% of $600, which is $60. So, her new monthly salary will be $600 + $60 = $660.
After 2 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $660, which is $66. So, her new monthly salary will be $660 + $66 = $726.
After 3 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $726, which is $72.60. So, her new monthly salary will be $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12.
Annual salary = $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to find out how many guests will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we need to find 1/4 of 16. 

1/4 of 16 is 16 / 4 = 4. 

So, 4 guests won't show up. That means 16 - 4 = 12 guests will show up.

Since Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 12 by .75. 

12 * .75 = 9.

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. 

Each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag.

9 * 2 = 18.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate how much the adults and children will eat.

Adults will eat 10 lbs each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is 20 x 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is 5 x 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amount the adults and children will eat to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find 10% of 40 seconds, we multiply 40 by 0.1. 
40 * 0.1 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time. 
40 - 4 = 36 seconds

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. We add them together to find the combined number of dogs and cats.
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. 
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats to find the total number of pets.
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide 64 ounces by 16 ounces to find out how many cans she used: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used: 4 * 3 = 12.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 3 miles are there in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

This means there are 14 groups of 3 miles in 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each group of 3 miles, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes to cover each group.

14 groups * 10 minutes per group = 140 minutes

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

We also know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, to find out how many cookies he meant to bake, we need to subtract 15 from 115. 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, we need to divide 100 by 2 to find out how many cookies he baked last year. 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 x $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 x $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 x $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 x $24 = $120.

"To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we need to first find out how many vehicles were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each. So, the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find out how many vehicles were imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles. 

30 (total vehicles) - 10 (vehicles from the first day) = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers.

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers.

We know Adrien earned $40000 four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can find Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (100% + 30% = 130% = 1.3). 

Lylah's salary = Adrien's salary / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years later was 40% higher than what he was making four years ago. 

Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago * 1.4 (100% + 40% = 140% = 1.4)
Adrien's salary four years later = $40000 * 1.4
Adrien's salary four years later = $56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume her salary also increased by 40%. 

Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago * 1.4
Lylah's salary four years later = $30769 * 1.4
Lylah's salary four years later = $43078 (approximately)

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their salaries.

Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts: 
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Jennie started with 60 letters that needed stamps. She put stamps on one-third of those letters. To find one-third of 60, we need to divide 60 by 3. 

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in that pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters she stamped from the 30 letters in the pile now.

30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. We also know that her husband bought 5 spoons. So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7 spoons

Now, we know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, if we add those 3 spoons back to the 7 spoons, we get the number of spoons Julia had before she used any. 

7 (spoons before husband's) + 3 (used spoons) = 10 spoons

So, Julia must have bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to find out how many fish sausages he bought and add that to the number of chicken sausages.

Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and multiply it by the number of items he's buying.

Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 times that, which is 3 x $15 = $45.

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons cost 4 x $45 = $180
- 20 peppers cost 20 x $15 = $300
- 10 oranges cost 10 x $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total amount the hospital charges the patients.

First, let's find the total time the doctors spend with the patients. There are 500 patients and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. We need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost of the doctors is:
Total cost of doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's find the total amount the hospital charges the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour and the total time spent by doctors is 200 hours.
Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost of the doctors.
Profit = Total amount charged to patients - Total cost of doctors
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000"

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to find the total.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to find out how many rides they took in total and multiply that by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode 4 + 6 = 10 rides. 
Each ride cost 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, on Tuesday, he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. So, his total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We also know that his total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday.

So, miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage for Monday through Wednesday - Total mileage for Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28

First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

(9 * 2) ÷ 3 = 18 ÷ 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know there are 3 types of bees: worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Let's say the number of queens is x. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of baby bees is 2x. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is 700. 

x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100

Now we know the number of queens is 100, the number of baby bees is 2x = 200, and the number of worker bees is 4x = 400.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, in one harvest, he can harvest 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

So, in a year, John can harvest 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples.

x = 6 * 3
x = 18

So, before the raccoon, there were 18 fries.

Then, three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Then, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

"To find the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

The price increase every 2 months is 20% of the original price. 
20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months, we need to calculate the price increase 18 times.

However, we can simplify this by finding the price increase for 2 months and then raising it to the power of 18.

The price after 2 months is $24, which is 1.2 times the original price ($20 * 1.2 = $24).

So, the price after 36 months is $20 * (1.2)^18.

She needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan, and she has to make 15 Spanish flans. So, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

She gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs she needs (45) by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job (9). 

45 / 9 = 5

"Let's say Brooke's age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28.

We can write an equation: (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8

Since Seth's age is 2x, Seth's age is 2 * 8 = 16.

"Pancho walks 20 miles a day, but only on weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, he walks 20 miles * 5 days = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles a day. So, he walks 10 miles * 2 days = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles he walks in a week, we need to add the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends. 
Total miles = miles on weekdays + miles on weekends
Total miles = 100 miles + 20 miles
Total miles = 120 miles

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. 
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. 
Average = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform.
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 insects. So, the total number of insect legs is 90 * 6 = 540.

The rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them. So, the total number of their legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of creature: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8), Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

To find the total age, we add the ages of all four birds: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To find out how much Jessica pays each month, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum for each debt. 

50% of $300 is $300 * 0.5 = $150. So, 50% more than the minimum for her student loans is $300 + $150 = $450.

50% of $200 is $200 * 0.5 = $100. So, 50% more than the minimum for her credit card is $200 + $100 = $300.

50% of $500 is $500 * 0.5 = $250. So, 50% more than the minimum for her mortgage is $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, let's add up how much she pays each month: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 to find out how much she pays in a year: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato, we need to add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cut. 

It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 1.5 minutes is 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds. 
It takes 5 seconds to cut a potato. 

So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60. 
95 * 60 = 5700 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert 5700 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. 
5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

The answer is: 95"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to figure out how many gallons they made. 

First, let's find out how much money they made in total. They made $25 in profit, but that's not the total amount of money they made. To find the total amount, we need to add the cost of the lemons and sugar. However, we don't know the cost yet, so let's move on to the next step.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Now, let's say they made 'x' gallons. The total amount of money they made is $10x.

The cost of making 'x' gallons is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x.

Their profit is the total amount of money they made minus the cost. We know their profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25

Now, divide both sides by $5:
x = $25 / $5
x = 5

So, they made 5 gallons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of it on rent, which is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000$.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 2500 * 1/2 = 1250$.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount he gives them is 200 + 700 = 900$.

So the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 60
Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

200 / 5 = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can multiply the number of white carnations by 4 to find the number of red roses.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time taken by the faster team from the total time taken by the slower team:

"To find the answer, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, let's compare the probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. To find the difference, we can subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the hamsters get 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

So, the hamsters and rabbits together get 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw.

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats. 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw.

We know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, we divide the total straw given to the rats by 6 to find out how many rats there are in total. 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first find the total cost of 20 dozen cups. 

First, let's find the cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. If each plate costs $6000, then the cost of 6 plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

Now, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. The cost of each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved. She also earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. Now, she has $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4). $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's say Jerry has 'x' red chickens. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has 'x + 2' white chickens.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so 'x' red chickens will produce 3x eggs a day. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so 'x + 2' white chickens will produce 5(x + 2) eggs a day.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 4.

So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the total distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter (the distance around the edge). The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.

Perimeter = 2(length) + 2(width)
Perimeter = 2(6) + 2(1.5)
Perimeter = 12 + 3
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find out how many customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, let's add the customers from the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the customers from the first two days from the total number of customers.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, so in 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons of water and the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200
So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she needs to pay.
$2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in 3 years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

   The tank had 120 liters initially, and 90 liters were used. 
   So, the amount of water left is 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

2. Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. 
   Since there were 30 liters left, she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

3. Now, we need to add the amount of water left in the tank and the amount of rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Since Andy planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to find the number of petunias. 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of petunias to the number of geraniums to find the total number of flowers.
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to know the total number of cards and the number of water type cards.

James initially had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He lost 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards now. He bought 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we need to find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums. 

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. The difference is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem says that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can say that the difference is twice the number of fish in one aquarium times 2 (because there are 2 aquariums).

Let's call the number of fish in one aquarium 'x'. Then, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x. 

The problem says that the difference between the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to find out how many animals he killed last night and today, then add them together.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals he killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars today. Then, he killed 3x wolves today. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now we know that Rick killed 12 cougars today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

So, the total number of animals Rick killed today is 12 + 36 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of animals Rick killed last night and today: 25 + 48 = 73.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls now, we need to find out how many cows each stall had initially. 
10 stalls had 20 cows each, so 10 * 20 = 200 cows. 
Now there are 20 stalls, so each stall had 200 / 20 = 10 cows.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. 
40 / 20 = 2 cows per stall.

So, each stall now has 10 + 2 = 12 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8.
12 * 8 = 96

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we need to first find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 feet and multiplying it by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, she's making 36 + 30 = 66 cookies in total.

Since 1 dozen is 12 cookies, we can divide 66 by 12 to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000. 
12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to get the total price of the house.
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

The total time to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take. 

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, so the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. We also know the number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette. 

So, the total number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette from the total number of stitches for the whole sweater, then divide by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

Total activities on the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total activities from both days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To find out how long the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate how much rice the household consumes in a week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day, so each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total rice consumption per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total rice consumption per week is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 kg / 14 kg per week = 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to first find out how many crates he sold in total. 

He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates. 
Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. 

So, the total number of crates he sold is 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

His target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we need to subtract the number of crates he sold from his target. 

120 - 65 = 55

"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day: 
30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles per day

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is:
60 miles per day * 5 days per week = 300 miles per week

Since John goes to work for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is:
300 miles per week * 50 weeks per year = 15,000 miles per year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
15,000 miles per year * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus given per year is:
$150 per month * 12 months per year = $1,800 per year

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
$30,000 per year + $1,800 per year = $31,800 per year

$31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 
So, Sunday + Monday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply 39 minutes by 2.

39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month. 

First, let's find out how many hours he works in a week. He works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week.

Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from hours worked is 50 * $10 = $500.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings is $500 + $300 = $800.

Now, let's find out how many weeks are in April. April has 30 days, and there are 7 days in a week, so there are 30 / 7 = 4.29 weeks. We'll round down to 4 weeks since you can't work a fraction of a week.

Now, let's multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April. $800 * 4 = $3200.

So, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find out how many people he beat first. Since he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we can calculate 80% of 20.

80% of 20 is 0.8 * 20 = 16

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

20 (total people) - 16 (people he beat) = 4

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 3.

Two-thirds of 60 = (60 * 2) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left.

Loaves left = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning
Loaves left = 60 - 40
Loaves left = 20

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we divide 20 by 2.

Half of 20 = 20 / 2 = 10

Since half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he lost (8 pounds) by the number of weeks (4). 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in 1 week, we can multiply the weight Joey loses in a week by 4 to find out how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Now, we know that Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to find out how many 4-week periods it will take for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy also loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy the same amount of time.

8 pounds / 8 pounds = 1 period of 4 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13 and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 x $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate how much he has spent so far and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150
Now, the cost of the flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200
So, the total amount spent so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
Now, subtract the amount spent from the total budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050
Finally, subtract the amount he wants to save: $4050 - $2000 = $2050

Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we add 5 to Jane's age to get Trent's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5

Since six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the population of Chile now is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is 'D'. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L * W * H
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. 

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

There were 15 women initially, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate, we need to multiply the number of hot dogs Luke ate by 3. 
Luke ate 2 hot dogs. 
Thomas ate 3 times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to divide the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2. 
John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 
John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now we know that the two equal groups have 70 students each. The smallest group has x - 10 students, which is 70 - 10 = 60.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to know how many chickens and cows there are. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up an equation: x + 2x = 60. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 60.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20.

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is (40 * 2) + (20 * 4) = 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to find the weight of each animal first. 

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 
The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each. 
The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. 
The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals: 
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

The container weighs 20 pounds, so we add that to the total weight of the animals:

Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means he has to run 5000 + (1/5 * 5000) meters in a day. 
1/5 * 5000 is 1000. 
So, he has to run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters in a day.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance he covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find the percentage more they're making per day now, we need to first find out how much they used to make per day and how much they make now.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, they used to make 10 * $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, they make 5 * $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the percentage more, we need to find the difference between the two amounts and divide it by the original amount, then multiply by 100.

The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100.
The percentage more is ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to find the total time he spent on all activities first. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so to find the total time, we need to divide 15 by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form). 
15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we know that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we multiply the total time by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form).

"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to find out how many miles it travels in a day and then divide the total miles it can travel before needing service by the miles it travels in a day.

First, let's find out how many miles the train travels from the third city to the first city. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. So the combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The train travels 50 miles less than that from the third city to the first city, so it travels 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's find out how many miles the train travels in one trip. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city. So the total miles in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 300 * 3 = 900 miles in a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total miles it can travel before needing service by the miles it travels in a day. So, 18,000 / 900 = 20.

Anna's pesos: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is: 130 (Axel's pesos) + 220 (Anna's pesos) = 350 pesos

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to first find out how much she makes in total and then subtract the cost of supplies. 

She has 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she has 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 x $1 = $36 in total.

She spent $18 on supplies. So, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find her profit per hour by dividing her total profit by the number of hours she is open. Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out the whole from the fraction 3/5. If he sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left.

Let's say the total land he had at first is x hectares. Then, 2/5 of x is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up an equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)

x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we need to first find out how many girls were in the choir. Since there are 52 members and 50% are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 52 by 0.5.

52 * 0.5 = 26

So, there are 26 girls in the choir. Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, only the girls will be performing. However, half of the girls can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. To find out how many girls can make it, we multiply 26 by 0.5.

26 * 0.5 = 13

So, 13 girls can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of girls who made it to the show and the number of teachers.

13 + 3 = 16

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

1/3 of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, we add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson (66) and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu (22).

"To find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to add the parts of the ratio together, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

Now, we divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts of the ratio (11) to find the value of one part. 
165 / 11 = 15

Since the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we multiply the value of one part (15) by the number of parts each of them has. 
Betty has 5 parts, so 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

"To find out how much money Tim saves, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 = $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, he saves $4 on Hulu and Disney Plus. 
The total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package. 
The cost of the cable package is $60. 
So, the amount of money Tim saves is $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to find the total time she spent working and the time she spent editing, then divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100.

First, let's convert all the times to minutes. 
Carol spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she spent 4 * 60 = 240 minutes writing the song.

She spent half that time recording it, so she spent 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording the song.

She spent 90 minutes editing the song.

Now, let's add up the total time she spent working: 
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 cards. So, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so now she has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark. 

Now, we subtract the slices Jenny gave away and the slices she ate from the total number of slices. 

12 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 5 slices left

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he still needs to save by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to save.

Amount Mark still needs to save: $250
Daily earnings: $10
Number of days Mark needs to save: $250 / $10 = 25

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk. 

For flour, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups. 4 times that is 3 * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup. 4 times that is 1 * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel saves, we need to first find out how much energy he uses in a day and then multiply it by 30 days.

Mel uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since he uses it for 8 hours a day, the total energy used in a day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If he reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The total energy used in a day will be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The amount of energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by 1 to get the total pounds of meat and cheese needed: 5 * 1 = 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we multiply the pounds of meat by the cost per pound of meat: 5 * $7.00 = $35.00 for the meat.

We also multiply the pounds of cheese by the cost per pound of cheese: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00 for the cheese.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. 

The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

The total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, $2400. Since there are 30 employees in June, the total amount paid in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many, so her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half as many apples from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees. Half of 30 is 15, so Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Now, let's add up the apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both sisters. 
Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. 
Her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees by both sisters is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can say that the total number of animals (camels and dromedaries) is 180. So, c + d = 180.

We also know that the total number of humps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can say that 2c + d = 304.

Now we have two equations: 
1. c + d = 180
2. 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation. 
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
This simplifies to c = 124.

Now that we know the number of camels (c), we can find the number of dromedaries (d) by substituting c into the first equation: 
124 + d = 180
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the normal rate. The normal rate lasted for 8 months at $12 per month, but we need to subtract the 6 months of the introductory deal from the total 24 months (2 years) to find out how many months were at the normal rate and the increased rate. 
24 months - 6 months = 18 months
The normal rate lasted for 8 months, so the increased rate lasted for 18 - 8 = 10 months. 
The normal rate cost is 8 months * $12/month = $96

Now, we'll calculate the cost of the increased rate. The increased rate lasted for 10 months at $14 per month.
10 months * $14/month = $140

Finally, we'll add up the costs of all three parts to find the total cost of 2 years of the service.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. We know that the jogger jeans cost $22 after a $2 discount. So the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans, the answer is negative.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibuses can hold 30 employees each, so 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add up the total capacity: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them together.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. 
So, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Lillian bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. 
So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of the soup and the cake first.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25. 
$4 * 0.25 = $1
So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the bagel, the soup, and the cake to find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his cards and then how many cards he sold.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $100 + $50 = $150 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100 cards. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared and how many hotdogs were needed.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have two hotdogs and 18 guests would have one hotdog. 

The total number of hotdogs prepared is 18 x 2 (for the 18 guests with two hotdogs) + 18 (for the 18 guests with one hotdog) = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there were not enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second one. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the number of hotdogs needed: 80 - 54 = 26.

However, this is the number of hotdogs that were not available, not the number of guests. Since each guest was supposed to get one more hotdog, we can say that 26 hotdogs were not available for 26 guests.

The answer is: 26"

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 6 / 2 = 3. 
Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 
Indras has 6 letters and her sister has 7 letters. 
6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add up the cost of the pot and pans, the mixing bowls, and the utensils. 

The pot and pans cost $120.00, the mixing bowls cost $20.00, and the 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. 

Now, let's add up the total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00. To do this, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20. 
$165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Three quarters of 100 is 75, so Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Twice 75 is 150, so Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 30, so Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container

Now, we know Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply 3/4 by 8.

(3/4) * 8 = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to figure out how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount of money he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 cents = 120 cents or $1.20 on chips.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he had $0.05 left. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Now, we subtract the money he spent on chips from the total amount he spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars ($3.75) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents or $0.75) to find out how many candy bars he bought: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of cake. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, we divide 20 by 8 to get the weight of one piece. 

20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they ate 2 pieces in total. We multiply the weight of one piece by 2 to get the total weight eaten.

2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces eaten

Now, we subtract the weight eaten from the total weight of the cake to get the weight of the remaining cake.

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Number of people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8
Oranges per person = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions cost $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost $2.00 per box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne, we multiply 4 minutes by 4. 
4 * 4 = 16 minutes

So, it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater. 

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the difference in their travel times and add 5 minutes to that. 
The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

Now, we add 5 minutes to that. 
12 + 5 = 17 minutes

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We already know the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3 feet per yard. 

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we know the length is 9 feet. We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. We can use this formula to find the width.

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The house starts at 40 degrees. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the temperature increases by 5 degrees each hour. So, the total increase in temperature is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees. 

The new temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature decreases by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Jon took 40 minutes to finish the swim. James finished the swim 10% faster. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes to finish the swim.

Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes) to finish the bike ride. James took 5 minutes longer, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to finish the bike ride.

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to finish the triathlon. Jon took 40 minutes to finish the swim, 80 minutes to finish the bike ride, and 50 minutes to finish the run. So, Jon took 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes to finish the triathlon.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes to finish the triathlon.

Now, we know that James took 36 minutes to finish the swim and 85 minutes to finish the bike ride. So, James took 36 + 85 = 121 minutes to finish the swim and the bike ride.

To find out how long it took James to finish the run, we subtract the time it took James to finish the swim and the bike ride from the total time it took James to finish the triathlon. So, James took 180 - 121 = 59 minutes to finish the run.

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how many miles it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30 / 60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed (32 miles per hour) by the time (0.5 hours) to get the distance: 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and it runs 16 miles, it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost 8 * 3 = $24.

She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 1 + 5 = 6th place. 
Then she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 6 - 2 = 4th place. 
After that, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 4 + 3 = 7th place. 
Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she was in 7 - 1 = 6th place.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to find out how many cards she gave away. 

First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck. 
6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then, let's find out how many baseball cards Miss Maria has. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box.
5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

Now, let's add the basketball and baseball cards together to find out how many cards Miss Maria has in total.
150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so we need to subtract those from the total number of cards.
350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Now, we know that Miss Maria gave 300 cards to her students, and each student got 10 cards. To find out how many students she has, we need to divide the number of cards by 10.
300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
First, we need to convert the cents to dollars. 45 cents is 0.45 dollars. 
Now, multiply the cost per apple by the number of apples: 20 * 0.45 = 9 dollars.
Becky received a $1 discount, so subtract that from the total: 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
First, we need to convert the cents to dollars. 50 cents is 0.50 dollars. 
Now, multiply the cost per apple by the number of apples: 20 * 0.50 = 10 dollars.
Kelly received a 10 percent discount. To find 10 percent of 10 dollars, multiply by 0.1: 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.
Now, subtract the discount from the total: 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. 
Kelly paid 9 dollars and Becky paid 8 dollars. 
9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

- 2 * 4 = 8 towels (twice as many as pillow cases)

Total pieces of laundry per room: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

Now, multiply by the number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of some on Saturday.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add all the shoes he has:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from 300:
300 - 180 = 120

"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to first find the total cost of the items she bought. 

The pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. $1 less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.

So, the total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. There are 30 students, and each student has 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

2. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply 300 by 1/5. 300 * 1/5 = 60 pencils used.

3. Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find the remaining pencils after two months. 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

4. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply 240 by 1/3. 240 * 1/3 = 80 pencils.

"To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to use the information given. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. Let's say the number of carrot sticks he eats is x.

Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks is x/2.

He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras take up, we need to first convert the shark's length to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 x 12 = 120 inches long.

The remoras are 6 inches each, and there are 2 of them, so their combined length is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches is of 120 inches. To do this, we divide 12 by 120 and multiply by 100.

12 / 120 = 0.1
0.1 x 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to figure out how many students have desktop computers and then add the 20 students who don't have them.

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, that means one-fourth of the students don't have desktop computers. We know that 20 students don't have desktop computers, so we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's say the total number of students is x. Then, one-fourth of x is 20. We can write this as:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students in total.

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to something first. 

There are 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 kids allergic to peanuts. If we add them together, we get 9 + 6 = 15. However, we counted the kids who are allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract 3 from 15. 

15 - 3 = 12. This means 12 kids are allergic to something. 

Now, we know there are 32 kids in the class. If 12 kids are allergic to something, we subtract 12 from 32 to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 x $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

So, he runs 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Now, we know James runs 10 miles an hour.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they eat twice a day. So each horse eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, they eat 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, they will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben will need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but because of the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack has 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we need to convert the cost to cents. $2.00 is equal to 200 cents.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to figure out how old she will be in four years. Since in four years she will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we multiply 14 by 3.

14 * 3 = 42

This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find her current age, we subtract 4 from 42.

42 - 4 = 38

So Angela is 38 years old now, but that's not correct because Brett is 14 and in four years Angela will be 42, so Angela is younger than 38. 

Let's try again. In four years Angela will be 42 years old. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. Angela will be 42 in four years and Brett will be 18 in four years. 

The difference in their ages will be the same now as it will be in four years. So we subtract 18 from 42 to get the difference in their ages.

42 - 18 = 24

This means Angela is 24 years older than Brett. Since Brett is 14 years old now, we subtract 24 from 14 to get Angela's current age.

14 + 24 is not correct because Angela is older than Brett. We need to subtract 24 from 14 + 4 + some number of years.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Paul drove his car for 14 days, so he had 14 morning rides and 14 afternoon rides.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 rides * $6 per ride = $84.
The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 rides * $2 per ride = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides together: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many oranges Ashley brought, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought to find the total number of oranges. 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make. 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find out when the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 

First, we subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:
200 = 20x

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found. If we call the number of insects Bodhi found 'B', then David found B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David. So, if David found B/2, then Lily found B/2 + 7.

We know that together they found 43 insects. So, we can write an equation: B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43.

Combine like terms: B + B/2 + B/2 is the same as B + B, which is 2B. So, the equation becomes 2B + (B/2 + B/2) + 7 = 43.

Combine the B/2 + B/2, which is B. So, the equation becomes 2B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B + B is 3B. So, the equation becomes 3B + 7 = 43.

Now, subtract 7 from both sides: 3B = 36.

Now, divide both sides by 3: B = 12.

So, Bodhi found 12 insects. David found half of that, which is 6. And Lily found 7 more than David, which is 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to find out how many yards each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4 to find out how many yards Mariah used. 
364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2 to find out how many yards her grandma used. 
364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards Mariah used and the yards her grandma used to find the total yards they used. 
91 + 182 = 273 yards.

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for her friends and the extra gifts she bought.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts.
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts.
Total gifts for friends = 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts.

Total gifts = 16 (for friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find twice the width of the rug, which is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out how much the grape and green apple gum cost together. We know the grape gum cost $2. The green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

We know Suzie paid $7 in all, so the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, we divide $4 by 2 to find the cost of each pack. $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the cheapest lumber, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood. 

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks and it costs $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks and it costs $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest lumber.

Now, let's find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24.
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4.

Since Frederick can get 400 sticks from one 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get 400 * 4 = 1600 sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has 4 legs, and each pair of snowshoes is for 2 legs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (4 legs / 2 legs per pair = 2 pairs).

Mario has 6 dogs, so he needs 6 * 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes 2 bus trips a day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of bus trips per day is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. 

Since she takes bus trips 5 days a week, the total cost of bus trips per week is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to know the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the zoo has 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals is 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

"To find out how many days Andy has to lose 30 lbs, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day. 
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. 
July has 31 days, but Andy's birthday is on the 19th, so we only count 19 days in July. 
So, the total number of days is 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

Now, she has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 25% of $400 is 0.25 * $400 = $100.

Now, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. 

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write an equation: 
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack has 5 bags, she bought 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The cost of each bag is $4, so the total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Tara sold each bag for $8. She sold 40 bags, so the total selling price is 40 * $8 = $320.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali gives $80 to his sister and is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. So, Ali uses $48 to buy dinner and is left with $80 - $48 = $32.

Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for the cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. 

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide 9 by 3/4. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.

9 * 4/3 = 9 * 4 / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the total weekly consumption in kWh.
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kWh to get the weekly electric bill.
Weekly bill before: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024
Weekly bill after: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504."

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs = $44 / $4
Number of CDs = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, and add the hours for the weeks he worked out 5 and 6 hours.

Josh worked out 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since he worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week). 
So, for those 5 weeks, he worked out 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours, he spent 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week he worked out 6 hours, he spent 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add all the hours together: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36.

Total hours spent working out: 36"
"Let's break this down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so we subtract 8 from 48:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. We add 40 to 40:
40 + 40 = 80

Now, at the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so we subtract 21 from 80:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 divided by 3, which is 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. We add 7 to 59:
59 + 7 = 66

"To find Jame's current age, we need to subtract 5 years from 27. 
27 - 5 = 22 years old, which is Jame's current age.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 
Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60 years old.
5 years younger than that is 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Since Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, we need to subtract 8 years to find his current age.
55 - 8 = 47 years old, which is Jame's cousin's current age.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age.
47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. We know that Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. The computer cost $1,100, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost to find the cost of the 2 monitors. 

$2,400 (total) - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600 (2 monitors)

Since there are 2 monitors, we can divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 / 2 = $300

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to know how many boys and girls there were. Since there were 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there were 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells the boys brought is 10 x 60 = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 x 600 = 2400). So the total number of shells the girls brought is 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is 3000 / 10 = 300.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all the books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete, we need to first find out how many vlogs she has already made. 

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Since Emma needs to make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total vlogs she needs to make.

72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much you paid, we need to first find out how much the 20% tip is and then add half of the bill to it.

The 20% tip is 20% of $50. To find 20% of $50, we multiply $50 by 0.20. 
$50 * 0.20 = $10

Now we have the tip, which is $10. We also need to pay half of the bill. Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.

Now we add the tip and half of the bill together to find out how much you paid. 
$10 + $25 = $35

"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, the $18 was shared among 3 boys. So each boy got $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he added $10 more, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left. So, he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save each day in the first half.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in the month. Let's say he saves x dollars each day in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

In the first half, he saves 15x dollars (15 days * x dollars per day). In the second half, he saves 15 * 2x = 30x dollars (15 days * 2x dollars per day).

The total amount he saves is 15x + 30x = 45x dollars. This should be equal to his target of $1125.

45x = 1125

To find x, we divide both sides by 45.

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2 * 25 = 50 dollars each day in the second half.

The cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the cost of all the fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he gets 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she gets 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to subtract Jenny's amount from Jairus' amount. 
$16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount is 100 dollars, so we can set up an equation: 
x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 
5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: 
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 
Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

He works 5 times a week, so the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to find out how many Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. A third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. A quarter of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So Cody and Trevor ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches in total.

They started with 12 sandwiches, so to find out how many are left, we subtract the number they ate from the total. 

12 - 7 = 5

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first find out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Now, we know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years 'x'. So, we can write an equation: 51 = 3x.

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Now, we know the nephew's age in 7 years is 17. To find his current age, we need to subtract 7 from 17. The nephew's current age is 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the money for each set of teeth separately.

For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, she received 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the money for all the teeth: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Richie scored 80 goals. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, we know how many goals each of them scored. Richie scored 80 goals, Mark scored 60 goals, and Anna scored 35 goals. 

To find the total number of goals, we need to add the goals scored by all three teenagers. 
80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to first find out how much he spent each day. Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we divide the total money he has ($70) by 7 days.

$70 / 7 days = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent 4 x $10 = $40. 

The number of wooden action figures he bought is $40 / $5 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he spent $10 per day on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, for these 3 days, he spent 3 x $10 = $30.

The number of plastic action figures he bought is $30 / $2 = 15.

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so he grows 40 x 4 = 160 roses per month.

The flower shops order 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week. In a month, they order 65 x 4 = 260 roses.

Now, let's subtract the number of roses Ford grows from the number of roses the flower shops order: 260 - 160 = 100.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 * $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the amount she removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf. 
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. 
So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost, so $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. So, she has 3 x 64 = 192 crayons. 

Since each muffin crayon is made of 8 small pieces of crayons, we need to divide 192 by 8. 
192 / 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. 

If she sells each muffin crayon for $1.50, she can make 24 x $1.50 = $36.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost to remove the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost to install the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw and divide it by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. 
On day three, he saw 0 birds. 
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. 
On day six, he saw 20 birds. 
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days

The starting value is 20. 
Half of the number is 20 / 2 = 10.
The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
This value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
The resulting value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

"To find the percentage that Maggie's oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature. 

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. 
Now, we divide by the set temperature: 18 / 450 = 0.04. 
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.04 * 100 = 4%.

Now, we know that Maggie's oven is off by 4%. If her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature that will give us 520 degrees with a 4% increase. 

Let's call the temperature she needs to set x. 
We know that x + 4% of x = 520. 
4% of x is 0.04x. 
So, x + 0.04x = 520. 
Combine like terms: 1.04x = 520. 
Now, divide by 1.04: x = 500.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour into 60 minutes. So, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert 2 hours into 120 minutes. So, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to find out how many cups and dishes Judy and her friend brought.

A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cups and dishes:
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost, we need to first find out the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount. 

The original price of 1 box is $100.00. Since it's 10% off, we need to find 10% of $100.00. 
10% of $100.00 is 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00. 
So the discount is $10.00. 
The price of 1 box after the discount is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. 

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00. 

Now, we know that 1 box has 90 contacts and will last 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have 2 * 90 = 180 contacts. 

To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts. 
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact. 

Since a pair of contacts has 2 contacts, we need to multiply the cost per contact by 2. 
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he earns $10 per hour, he earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to find out how many calories she burned in total. 

She did aerobics for 2 hours, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She also ran for 1 hour, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

In total, she burned 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories by the amount of water she needs for every 200 calories. 8 * 100 = 800.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms: 
3x = 4500

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 1500

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. 
The number of red jelly beans is 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.
The number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the weight gained from eating donuts minus the weight lost from eating Cheerios. However, since one is a gain and the other is a loss, we add the two values to find the difference: 8.75 + 6.25 = 15.

"To find out how many seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

First, let's start with the 100 people she invited via email. Each of them will also invite 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 additional people.

Now, we add the 100 people she invited to the 200 additional people: 100 + 200 = 300.

Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, that's 10 friends + 8 spouses = 18 people.

Now, we add the 300 people from the email invitations to the 18 people from the phone calls: 300 + 18 = 318.

So, Alex will need seats for 318 people.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. 
The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 
The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. 
The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon, so shipping costs $4 x 2 = $8. The total cost is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay. To do this, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to track its growth.

Day 1: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
Day 2: The beanstalk doubles to 8 feet tall.
Day 3: The beanstalk doubles to 16 feet tall.
Day 4: The beanstalk doubles to 32 feet tall.

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk needs to be at least 21 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than the window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per day, we need to first find out how many grams of protein are in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

Since 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms by setting up a proportion. 

If 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will have 2 times 3 grams of protein, which is 6 grams of protein.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day (6 grams) by 7.

6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams

"Let's break this down step by step. 

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means if he was x years old 5 years ago, he is 2x years old now. 

Since 5 years have passed, we can set up an equation: x + 5 = 2x. 

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides: 5 = x. 

So Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago. 

Now, Jerry is 5 + 5 = 10 years old. 

In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. 
He also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's call the smallest angle 'x'. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is 3x.

We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine the x terms: 6x = 180.

Now, divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know x, we can find the other angles. The smallest angle is x, which is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to know how much money he has in total. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the cents together:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total cents by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to know how many legs each type of pet has. Dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2 legs.

Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs = 20 legs
Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs = 8 legs
Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs = 20 legs

Now, we add up all the legs: 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = 48 legs

"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the weight after he increases it by 50%. To do this, we need to find 50% of 8 pounds. 50% is the same as 0.5. So, 8 * 0.5 = 4 pounds. 
2. Now, we add the 50% (4 pounds) to the original weight (8 pounds). 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.
3. Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight 2 pounds lighter. 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to add up the games he got from his parents, the games he bought each year, and the games he got for Christmas.

Steve's parents got him 5 games initially. 
In the first year, he bought 1 game per month, so that's 1 * 12 = 12 games. He also got 5 games for Christmas.
In the second year, he bought 2 games per month, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 games. He also got 5 games for Christmas.
In the third year, he bought 4 games per month, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 games. He also got 5 games for Christmas.

Now, let's add up all the games: 
5 (initial games) + 12 (first year) + 5 (first year Christmas) + 24 (second year) + 5 (second year Christmas) + 48 (third year) + 5 (third year Christmas) = 
5 + 12 + 5 + 24 + 5 + 48 + 5 = 104

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Distance = 2000 miles
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour, we need to divide the total pounds of chocolates he makes in 2 hours by 2. 
Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 
Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds in an hour.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 1 hour. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds in an hour, so together they make 60 + 90 = 150 pounds in an hour.

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 150 * 12 = 1800.

Now, let's add up the money he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so we subtract the money he spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned in the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade.
The total amount of money he earned in the first 4 hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade.
The total amount of money he earned in the next 2 hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

Now, we add the money he earned in the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide that by the total number of rotations the tire can handle.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire undergoes in a year. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so in a year (12 months), he drives 400 * 12 = 4800 miles.

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, the total number of rotations in 4800 miles is (4800 / 2) * 725 = 2400 * 725 = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Now, we know the tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years it will last, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year: 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6 years.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the discount and subtract it from the $50 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the outfit before the discount:
Shirt: $25
Shorts: $35
Total cost: $25 + $35 = $60

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
Discount = 30% of $60
Discount = 0.3 x $60
Discount = $18

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost - Discount
Total cost after discount = $60 - $18
Total cost after discount = $42

Since Joe has $50, we can now calculate how much money he will have left:
Money left = $50 - $42
Money left = $8

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 by 7. 
4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4. 
28 * 1/4 = 28 * 0.25 = 7

Cost for Monica's street = 194 * 150 = 29,100 dollars.

To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street.
Cost for Lewis' street = 194 * 490 = 95,060 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.
Difference in cost = 95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960 dollars.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of John's research is the cost for the first 5 months plus the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Administrators = 72 / 4 = 18

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total seats to find the remaining seats.
Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
Parents = 54 / 3 = 18

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find the seats occupied by the students.

Now, we multiply Ashley's speed (20 kb per second) by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds). 
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds = 72000 kb per hour.

Now, we need to convert kb to Mb. We know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we divide 72000 kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per hour.

The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire each car. 
30% of $25,000 is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The company sold each car for $25,000. 
So, the profit per car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to figure out the maximum amount his parents are willing to pay per class, which is $10. 

Since Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60, we can calculate the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes: $60 / 10 classes = $6 per class.

However, his parents will only pay up to $10 per class. If Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's say Manny misses x classes. Then, he attends (10 - x) classes. The total cost is still $60, so we can set up the equation:

$60 / (10 - x) = $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

$60 = $10(10 - x)
$60 = $100 - $10x
$10x = $100 - $60
$10x = $40
x = $40 / $10
x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to find the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can say that the sales from green hats were 2 times the sales from red hats.

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * 400
Sales from green hats = 800

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he used the carriage and then subtract the free hour. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour is $15. The next hour is twice the cost, so it's $15 * 2 = $30. The third hour is also twice the cost of the previous hour, so it's $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's add up the cost of the hours James paid for: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate how much money she actually received. 

We know Sally started with $200 and now has $420. So, the amount of money she received is $420 - $200 = $220.

Since Sally's weekly wage should be $300, we subtract the amount she actually received ($220) from her full wage ($300) to find out how much was withheld. 

$300 - $220 = $80

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 
16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find out how many eggs Lori needs.
48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to divide the number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Lori needs.
24 eggs / 12 = 2

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to find out how many pages she has already written. 

Since Shiela finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we multiply 15 pages by 1/3. 
15 * 1/3 = 15 / 3 = 5 pages.

Now, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.
15 - 5 = 10 pages.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

Total number of pages = 200
Number of pages read per day = 10

Number of days to finish the book = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike finishes the book in 20 days and the deadline is 30 days, we need to subtract the number of days it took him to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he finishes.

Number of days before the deadline = Deadline - Number of days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the plane and the cost of maintaining it for the first year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000. For a year, that's 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting a hanger, so it's 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month. For a year, that's 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost of maintaining the plane for the first year is $60,000 (hanger) + $120,000 (fuel) = $180,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000.

"To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to find the cooking time for each item. 

First, we know it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time it took to cook all the food by adding the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each type of nut and then add them together.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- 1/2 pound almonds costs 1/2 * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound walnuts costs 1/3 * $15 = $5

Total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- 1/5 pound almonds costs 1/5 * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound walnuts costs 1/3 * $15 = $5

Total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write an equation: 
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each animal has one head, we can write another equation: 
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve these two equations together. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make it easier to work with: 
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation: 
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to: 
2s = 30

Now, we can divide both sides by 2: 
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he's buying a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 
7 pounds of coffee at $6 per pound will be 7 * $6 = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 
So the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Total cost of items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total number of hours he spends in class is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total number of hours by 1.5.

48 / 1.5 = 32

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we first need to find out how many math teachers are there.

Now, to find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.
Number of math teachers = Total teachers - Number of history teachers
Number of math teachers = 150 - 90
Number of math teachers = 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. To find out how much money Rayna has, we add 60 to Kassidy's money.

Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we add up all their money to find the total amount.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person will have if they share the money equally, we divide the total money by 3.

Money each person will have = Total money / 3
Money each person will have = $360 / 3

In the next 8 days, she had 0 good days. 
In the next 8 days, she had 0 good days. 
In the last 6 days, she had 12 - 8 = 4 good days.

In the last 3 days, she had 2 good days.

So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 + 2 = 14.

"Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write an equation: 
2x + 3 = 21 (Janey has 21 books)

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2:
x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the current height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the number of inches it needs to grow (360) by the number of inches it grows per day (30). 360 / 30 = 12.

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

"To find out how many toys James needs, we need to figure out how many dogs are in the shelter. 

James started with 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then 8 more dogs came, so there were 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. He bought toys for them.

When he came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Twice as many more dogs means 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs. So now there are 12 + 24 = 36 dogs.

Then 3 dogs left, so there are 36 - 3 = 33 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 33 toys.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = 2/5 * 1200 = 480.

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount: $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = 2/3 * 720 = 480.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up the cookies each person has:

Then, she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20cm. 

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode will take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. This means we have 2 twins and 3 triplets, for a total of 5 kids.

Let's say the age of one of the triplets is x. Then the age of the twin who is 7 years older than that triplet is x + 7.

We don't know the ages of the other twin and the other two triplets, but we can say that the ages of the two twins are the same, and the ages of the three triplets are the same.

So, the combined ages of the 5 kids are: x + (x + 7) + x + x + x = 44.

Combine like terms: 5x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x = 37.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 7.4.

Now we know the age of one of the triplets is 7.4 years old. The twin who is 7 years older than that triplet is 7.4 + 7 = 14.4 years old.

Since the two twins are the same age, the other twin is also 14.4 years old.

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from $3.20 to find the cost of 4 candies. $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies.

To find the cost of 1 candy, we divide $1.20 by 4. $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. So, 1 candy costs $0.30.

Now, we know the cost of 1 lollipop ($0.40) and 1 candy ($0.30). We can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops will cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and divide by 5. 
20 * 2 = 40
40 / 5 = 8

So Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find out how many months are in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 10 by 12.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

Now we know the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 x $100 = $60.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Now, let's calculate the amount James saved: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, but it's 10% higher now. 

To find 10% of $700, we multiply $700 by 0.1. 
$700 * 0.1 = $70

Now, we add the 10% increase to the original price to get the new price.
$700 + $70 = $770

The new price of each computer is $770. Now, we multiply this by the number of computers they wanted to buy, which is 500.
$770 * 500 = $385,000

The total amount of money they paid is $385,000."
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

The eggs are 75 calories each, and there are 6 eggs, so the total calories from eggs is 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

The cheese is 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces, so the total calories from cheese is 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

The ham is 40 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces (since it's an equal amount to the cheese), so the total calories from ham is 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

"To find out how many people accept the position, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of 100 people receive interviews, we multiply 100 by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%).
100 * 0.3 = 30

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find out how many people receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer, we multiply 30 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%).
30 * 0.2 = 6

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we find out how many people accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we divide 6 by 3.
6 / 3 = 2

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for the time with arms raised and the time with arms at her sides, then add them together.

When Helga's arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps for this time is:
200 taps/minute * 2 minutes * 2 feet = 800 taps

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps for this time is:
(300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) * 3 minutes = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps

Now, we add the total taps for both times:
800 taps + 1650 taps = 2450 taps

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There were 5 pizzas in total (Bryce and 4 friends). Each pizza had 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas. 2/3 of 3 pizzas is 2 pizzas. 2 pizzas have 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The 2 remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate ¾ of 2 pizzas. ¾ of 2 pizzas is 1.5 pizzas. 1.5 pizzas have 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

So, in total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices were left: 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we need to convert Topher's shoe length to inches first. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches, Topher's shoe length is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call Bobby's shoe length 'x'. Then, 9x + 10 = 100.

To find 'x', we need to subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 100 - 10, 9x = 90.

Now, we divide both sides by 9: x = 90 / 9, x = 10.

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 / 4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5. 
50% of 20 = 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left. She trades them for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of the large stickers. 

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. We have 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. We also have 60 small buttons. To find the total number of buttons, we add the large buttons and small buttons. 29 + 60 = 89.

Now that we know x (the number of votes against) is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

Extra-small: 11 students
Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students
Medium: Four less than the number of small students, so 22 - 4 = 18 students
Large: Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
Extra-large: Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:

Now, we need to find out how many people are left after 10 people think horse #2 will win.
50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we need to start with the information we know. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. So, the total number of Pomeranians is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If two thirds of the puppies are 18, then the total number of puppies is 18 divided by 2/3, or 18 divided by 2 and then multiplied by 3. 

18 divided by 2 is 9, and 9 multiplied by 3 is 27.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to figure out how many the first and second houses need. 

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles is 250. So, we can set up an equation: x/2 + x + x = 250.

Combine like terms: 2.5x = 250.

Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100.

Now we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so the first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, the amount of money she had left is $80 - $20 = $60.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the amount of money she had left ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5) to find out how many candy bars she bought.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first find out how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, he made 20 x $3 = $60 from selling the eggplants.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the amount of money he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of 9 hours = 9 hours / 3 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours. 
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. He has 73 motorcycles, so he will need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Now, we need to add the total number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles. 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

"To find the total cost, we need to break down the movies into three categories: series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in each series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can divide 600 by 3.
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these series movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is $10. So, the cost of a series movie is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie (but we will use $1.67 for calculation purposes, and then round at the end)

Now, let's find the cost of the series movies:
200 movies * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies. To find the number of older movies, we can multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of an older movie is $5. So, the cost of the older movies is:
160 movies * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of a normal movie is $10. So, the cost of the normal movies is:
240 movies * $10 = $2400

Now, let's find the total cost:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

Rounded to two decimal places, the cost of the series movies is $333.40.

Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so let's say Emma collects y berries. Then Ava collects y + 3 berries. 
Ava gets 5 points for each berry, so Ava gets 5(y + 3) points and Emma gets 5y points for berries.

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so let's say Emma finishes the level with z seconds left. Then Ava finishes the level with z - 4 seconds left. 
Ava gets 30 points for each second left, so Ava gets 30(z - 4) points and Emma gets 30z points for seconds left.

Now, let's calculate the total points for Ava and Emma:
Ava's points = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)
Ava's points = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120
Ava's points = 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

Emma's points = 10x + 5y + 30z

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish. He then bought 17 more fish. Let's say he bought x orange fish and (17 - x) white fish.

We know that after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish.

The total number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + x (new). The total number of white fish is 4 (initial) + (17 - x) (new).

We can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2 * (4 + (17 - x))

Simplifying the equation: 3 + x = 2 * (21 - x)
3 + x = 42 - 2x
3x = 39
x = 13

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish. Since he bought 17 fish in total, he bought 17 - 13 = 4 white fish.

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's points, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

Now, we need to add Pierson's points and Nikita's points to find the total. 
278 (Pierson's points) + 150 (Nikita's points) = 428.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. 
Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Now, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers in each class.
Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers.
Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find out how many stuffed animals she already has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. Let's add them up: 
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we know she has 14 stuffed animals. If she wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find out what 30% of the total number of stuffed animals will be after she buys the goats.

Let's say the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We want the number of stuffed goats (x) to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x). We can write this as an equation:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

To solve for x, we can multiply 0.3 by 14 and x:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we need to get all the x terms on one side. Let's subtract 0.3x from both sides:
x - 0.3x = 4.2
0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
She plays for half an hour each day, so in 14 days, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
So, in 7 days, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 2 hours, we multiply its speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 2 hours, we multiply its speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance between the cars = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
Distance between the cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between the cars = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80%. 
  Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed: 
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

The total number of students is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, let's find the overall pass rate: 
(700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to find out how many square inches he can make with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has a total of 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic. So, with 144 chips, Milo can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to divide the total square inches by the height to find the length. 

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first find out how many quarts of tea were consumed. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. 

Total quarts consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 
There are 10 quarts left, so the total quarts at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how much money is used, we need to find out how many quarters each person used. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes they played. 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he can play 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, they can play 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they used 24 x 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play 20 x 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, he can play 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 x $0.25 = $17.

68 quarters is the same as 68 x $0.25 = $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x. 
Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. 
The amount of sugar is the same as salt, so it's also 2x.
Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients: x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

   Joe's total number of cars = 20 * 2 = 40

2. Next, we need to find out how many cars Joe sold. Since Joe sold 20% of his cars, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%) to get the number of cars he sold.
   Number of cars Joe sold = 40 * 0.2 = 8

3. Then, we need to find out how many cars Joe gave to his mother. Since Joe gave twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, we multiply the number of cars he sold (8) by 2.
   Number of cars Joe gave to his mother = 8 * 2 = 16

4. Finally, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. We subtract the number of cars he sold (8) and the number of cars he gave to his mother (16) from his total number of cars (40).

So, 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current amount from the desired amount: 
25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk per day. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the amount of milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 
10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
Since the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 
The used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 
The used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The answer is: 20"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. 

Jack's socks = 60 / 2 = 30 socks

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, we multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2.

Peter's socks = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of Jack's dishes by 2.

Peter's dishes = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes each of them has.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. There is also a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time available for the groups to perform is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4) * 300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, Brenda earns the same amount of interest each year. So, in 3 years, she earns 3 * $225 = $675 in interest.

Farm X had 55 goats and 10 were sold, so 55 - 10 = 45 goats are left in Farm X.
Farm Y had 45 goats and 20 were sold, so 45 - 20 = 25 goats are left in Farm Y.

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 pairs by 12 months. 
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we know James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say my brother's age is B, my age is A, and my sister's age is S. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can say A = B - 3.

Since I am 2 years older than my sister, we can say A = S + 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so mom's age is 3B - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Now, we can use the first two equations to express B and S in terms of A. 
B = A + 3
S = A - 2

Now, we can plug these into the last equation:
A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 and round up to the nearest whole number, because Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

Total glue sticks needed = 54
Number of glue sticks per pack = 8
Number of packs needed = 54 / 8 = 6.75

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it also includes a 15-minute encore. Let's call the length of her usual concerts 'x'. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the length of the final concert without the encore would be 2x. 

Adding the 15-minute encore, the total length of the final concert is 2x + 15. 

We are given that the total length of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as Tuesday or Wednesday, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

"To find the number of microphones that won't fit, we need to calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10 microphones.

Since 10 microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that will fit is 50 - 10 = 40.

Now, we need to find the number of pairs that can be made from 40 microphones. Since each pair has 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add the birds nesting, flying, and feeding.

First, let's find the number of birds flying. Since there are 2/3rd of 6 birds flying, we multiply 6 by 2/3. 
6 * 2/3 = 4 birds flying.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.
3 * 8 = 24 birds feeding.

Now, we add the birds nesting, flying, and feeding.
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

Remaining cookies = 50

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find out how many cookies were in each jar.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies in each jar = Remaining cookies / Number of jars
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5

The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is 5 x 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is 10 x 4 = 40.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of petals for the daisies and the total number of petals for the orchids.

"To find the number of flowering plants, we need to first find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25. 
So, there are 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is (2/3) * 75 = 50. 
So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
The number of flowering plants is 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to know the speed of a thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first find out how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, and we can assume that she charged the same amount for each lawn, we can say that she mowed Joe's lawn once. 

So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. If she charged $6 per lawn, then she made 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala's lawn.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. She made 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba's lawn.

In total, she made $6 from Joe's lawn, $18 from Kamala's lawn, and $30 from Alba's lawn. So, she made $6 + $18 + $30 = $54 from mowing lawns.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, and $54 was from mowing lawns, she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.

Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today.

Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

For small masks, she can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make. 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set needs 2 yards of material, we multiply 5 by 2. 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks, she can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make. 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will use 2.67 to get the exact amount of material needed). Since each set needs 2.25 yards of material, we multiply 2.67 by 2.25 (first multiply 2 by 2.25, then multiply 0.67 by 2.25 and add the results). 2 * 2.25 = 4.5, 0.67 * 2.25 = 1.5, 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 yards.

He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins is 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

To find the total calories of all the pastries, we add the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.
Total days = 5 days.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

For the bus: 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = 300 miles
For the car: 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. To do this, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled.

300 miles (bus) - 240 miles (car) = 60 miles

Number of stacking rings = 9
Total number of toys = 62

First, let's add the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings.
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract 48 from the total number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that Paul is 10 years older than John. Let's say John's age is x. Then Paul's age is x + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. So, Peter's age is x + (x + 10).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 80

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 26.67 (round down to 26.67 is not possible for age, so we will use 26 for John and 36 for Paul)

Now we know John's age is 26 and Paul's age is 36. 

Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is 26 + 36 = 62.

"Maria's friends each got 2 water balloons at first, and there are 4 friends. So, 2 x 4 = 8 water balloons for her friends. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. So, 8 + 1 = 9 water balloons at first.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends). So, 3 x 5 = 15 more water balloons.

Now, we add the water balloons they had at first (9) to the new water balloons (15). 9 + 15 = 24.

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already had 10 boxes, so now they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance each person spits and then find the average of those two distances.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the average of 400 and 420. To do this, we add the two numbers and divide by 2.

400 + 420 = 820
820 / 2 = 410

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets a day. In a month with 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day. In a month with 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine makes in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 widgets in a month, so it makes 43200 * 6 = $259200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 widgets in a month, so it makes 32400 * 6 = $194400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 makes.

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

For the 12-hour stay, the cost is 1000 pesos. Since Cameron stayed for 17 hours, he will have to pay for 5 additional hours. The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, the cost would be 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the amount of hay each goat and sheep needs, then multiply it by the number of goats and sheep.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we multiply the amount of hay each goat and sheep needs by the number of goats and sheep.
15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep.
75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many pens John can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he earned. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.

Now he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher gets: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."

The visit charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since Patty charges per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. So, 2.25 hours becomes 3 hours. The labor charge is 3 * $35 = $105.
The parts charge is $60.

Now, let's add the charges: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs and then subtract the amount he got from selling 5 of them.

First, let's find the total cost of the CDs. James got 10 CDs for 40% off, so we need to find the original price and then subtract 40% of that.

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 x $15 = $150
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 x $150 = $60
So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the 10 CDs.

Now, James sells 5 CDs for $40. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost.

Amount James was out = Total cost - Amount he got from selling CDs

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into three parts: the time he swam 60% of the distance, the time he rested, and the time he swam the remaining distance.

First, let's find the distance James swam at his normal speed. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

He rested for half as long as the swimming time, so he rested for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance. James swam 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

Since James swam the remaining distance at half his normal speed, his speed was 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it took him to swim the remaining distance is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance, the time he rested, and the time he swam the remaining distance. 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we multiply Marcus' age by 2 to find Leo's age.

Now, let's add up all the points: x (Dinar) + (x + 10) (Bahati) + (x + 10 - 20) (Azibo) = 45.

Combine like terms: x + x + 10 + x - 10 = 45.

Combine x terms: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to get the number of 15-minute intervals.
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30 reports.
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Now, let's find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.
50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients are admitted.

Now, the total number of occupied beds is 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (newly admitted) = 900 beds.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each phone. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so that's 2 x $600 = $1200.

The next 2 phones (for the kids) are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That's 2 x $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of all the phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find out how many players Zeke's team has and then add it to Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

"To find the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to find the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister.

She started with 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's 4 boxes in total. 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

So, she gave away 80 oranges. Now she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 160 is 160 / 4 = 40 oranges.

Now, she has 160 - 40 = 120 oranges left to sell.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39.

Tyler already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by the amount he earns per hour ($5). 

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have.

We know Robert has 30 cherries and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know Richard and Robert have a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. Since they are sharing 60 cherries, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390
Total amount earned: $150 + $390 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate how many ounces of sunscreen she will use in total.

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. 

She will be on vacation for 8 days, so she will use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old. 

Since Emil turns 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil turns 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. 
The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the pounds of crawfish he caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we need to divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

20% of 30 is 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students. 
30 - 6 = 24 students.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. 
25% of 24 is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we need to add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we add Charlie's and Sophie's boot sizes and divide by 2 to find the average.

Average size = (Charlie's size + Sophie's size) / 2
Average size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend:

28 plants * $6/plant = $168

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first find out how much soil they used for the sunflowers and carnations.

They planted 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.

They also planted 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They started with 30 pounds of soil, so the amount of soil left is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month. In a year, she will set aside:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change for each part of the process.

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature change is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees lower.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the temperature change is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees lower.

3. After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature change is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees higher.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So, we subtract 75 from 90 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the first day, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

On the second day, they pumped a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In two days, they pumped a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the total gallons pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards.

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. 

Since the charge remaining was 28% after 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge before the last 3 hours:

Let x be the charge before the last 3 hours.
x - 7% of x - 7% of x - 7% of x = 28%
x - 0.07x - 0.07x - 0.07x = 28%
x - 0.21x = 28%
0.79x = 28%
x = 28% / 0.79
x = 35.44%

Now, we know the charge before the last 3 hours was 35.44%. This was after 5 hours of losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.

Let y be the charge when Maria went out to the park.
y - 9% of y - 9% of y - 9% of y - 9% of y - 9% of y = 35.44%
y - 0.09y - 0.09y - 0.09y - 0.09y - 0.09y = 35.44%
y - 0.45y = 35.44%
0.55y = 35.44%
y = 35.44% / 0.55
y = 64.43%

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.43%.

"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car. 

20% of $10000 is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.

Now, let's calculate how much Janet makes per week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she makes $10 + $15 = $25 per hour. 

Since she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 per week.

Now, let's divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by the amount she makes per week ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

$2000 / $1000 = 2

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate how much money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $.5 each is 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each is 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each is 5 * .75 = $3.75

Total money spent so far is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar had $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the money he has left by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy. 

$.75 / $.25 = 3

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are, and then calculate how many of those she's sure to get right.

First, let's find out how many easy questions there are. 40% of 60 is 0.4 x 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the easy questions from the total to find the rest: 60 - 24 = 36 questions. Half of these are average, and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get right. She's sure to get 75% of the easy questions right, which is 0.75 x 24 = 18 easy questions. She's also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions right, which is 0.5 x 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 x 18 = 9 difficult questions.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $12 * x. The total amount she earned from selling small stuffed animals is $4 * 2x.

We know that she earned a total of $120. So, we can set up the equation: 
12x + 8x = 120

Combine like terms: 
20x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 20: 
x = 6

Since x is the number of large stuffed animals, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.
He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 is 12, so with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day. 
40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the chance that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the chance that the normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension, and Marcus gets a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the chances that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher gives extension) + 6% (normal teacher doesn't give extension, Marcus gets personal extension) = 76%

Since there's a 76% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework, the chance that he will have to turn it in is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 
In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls in the first set is x + 4. 
In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that the total number of balls is 19. So, we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve this equation, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to find out how many books are not written in English or German. 

First, let's find the number of English books. Half of 50 books are written in English. Half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25.

Now, let's find the number of German books. 10% of 50 books are written in German. 10% is the same as 10/100, so we multiply 50 by 10/100. 50 * 10/100 = 5.

Now we know that there are 25 English books and 5 German books. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to first find out how many kilometers she has already driven. 

Since Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, we multiply 325 by 4 to get the total distance she has driven so far. 
325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers.

Now, we subtract the distance she has driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.
1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks, we need to divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people is 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, so the total number of people is 140 - 50 = 90.
   Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100 people. 
   So, the total number of people is 90 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 people descended from the train, so the total number of people is 190 - 80 = 110.

The tank top cost $10. 
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

Now, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt) to find the number of tiles needed. 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Since each tile costs $12, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72.

So James pays $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, James pays $192 * 12 = $2304 a year.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to first find out how many loads he does in a week. 

He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. His laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time. So, to wash 4 twin sets, he needs to do 2 loads (4 twin sets / 2 sets per load = 2 loads). 

He also has 1 king size bed, which requires 1 load. 

So, in a week, he does 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king size bed = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can add Donovan's time and Betsy's time to get the total time.

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The painkillers cost $4 each, and Hannah gets 30 of them. So, the painkillers cost $4 * 30 = $120.
The parking costs $6/hour, and the minimum is 2 hours. So, the parking costs $6 * 2 = $12.

70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas. So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. They had 20 pizzas initially, so they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 80% of 40.

80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas. So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. They had 40 pizzas initially, so they have 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and there are 700 small coupons. So, the cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and there are 1400 big coupons. So, the cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Finally, let's add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together. The total cost is 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). The total cost is 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, 7 meatball sub sandwiches contain 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

So, after Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs left.

Then Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, Sidney got 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs.

Now, Sidney has 12 + 12 = 24 meatballs.

"To find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to first find out how many trucks were able to deliver. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20 trucks.

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver. The number of trucks that were able to deliver is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying.

Total tons of fertiliser delivered = 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he can use this promotion three times (6 pounds / 2 pounds per promotion). 

For each promotion, he pays $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 for the second pound (half off). So, the cost for each promotion is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15, and she bought 3 more roses, we need to calculate the cost of those 3 extra roses. Each rose costs $2, so 3 roses cost 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost of 15 roses is $15 (for 12 roses) + $6 (for 3 roses) = $21.

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she gets is $25 (the amount she paid) - $21 (the cost of the roses) = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, we need to divide the change ($4) by the value of a quarter ($0.25) to find out how many quarters she gets.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station when the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, we subtract 10 from the total time to get the waiting time. So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes."

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. 15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB type. We already know that 150 were Trekking and 45 were BMX, so the number of MTB bikes is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Now, let's calculate his extra learning time. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days. So, his extra learning time is 2 * (1/16) * 1600 = 200 minutes.

"To find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, that means the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors left. So, the velociraptors left 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what the T-Rex left, that means the T-Rex left 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the triceratops had 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall's area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall's area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

One gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by 20: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Since one gallon costs $12, the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to know the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas left.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Out of the 11 sodas, 3 were shaken and 8 were unshaken.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, the number of shaken sodas left is 3 - 1 = 2, and the number of unshaken sodas left is 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, there are 2 + 6 = 8 sodas left in total, and 2 of them are shaken.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

So, the likelihood is (2 / 8) * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the distance each train traveled and then add them together.

The first train is traveling 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it traveled in 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling half the distance of the first train, so it's traveling 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it traveled in 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to find out how many days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2. 
50 * 0.2 = 10 days.

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Since Billy works for 40 days, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks. 
2 15-minute breaks add up to 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 
So, the total time for lunch and breaks per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour. 

Bobby does this for 5 days, so we multiply 1 hour by 5 days: 
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to know how many miles Micah ran and then subtract the miles ran by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add the miles ran by Amber and Micah: 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

The total miles ran by all three is 52 miles. 
So, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then subtracting the returned amount from the initial charge.

Sheila initially charged $85.00. She returned an item worth $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the towels after the discount.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20):
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
So the discount is $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The towels were on sale for 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10):
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
So the discount is $3.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

New balance: $113.00"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lauren needs to save for retirement and then figure out how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren needs to save for retirement. She wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. So, she'll need:

$100,000 x 0.40 = $40,000 per year

Since she wants to save for 20 years of retirement, she'll need:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her annual salary, which is:

$100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To find out how many years it will take her to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year:

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

Since Lauren is already working, we assume she has already started saving. However, the problem doesn't specify how long she has been working. To find out how many more years she needs to work, we'll assume she starts from scratch.

240 / 40 = 6

Now that we know 1% is 6, we multiply 6 by 100 to get 100%. 
6 * 100 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 are boys, we subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls. 
600 - 240 = 360

Now, let's add up the heights: 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6: 18 / 6 = 3.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is planning to hike twice a day, we need to divide the daily miles by 2.

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles each time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we need to subtract the planned miles from the required miles per hike.

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

So, Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike, or 60 more miles per day (since she hikes twice a day), but the question asks for miles per day, and she hikes twice a day, so we need to divide the 60 miles by 2.

60 miles / 2 = 30 miles

2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys an hour.

So, the first 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, they produce 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more toys after the first 4 workers finish their shift. This means the first 4 workers and the fifth worker together produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write an equation: x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's first find her speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we can divide the distance by the time. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
Speed = 2 * (1/20 miles per minute)
Speed = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk. We know she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 1/10 miles per minute.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

"To find the temperature of the second bottle, we need to find the average temperature of the water in the bottle after Donny pours the water from the two mugs. 

Let's say the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into his bottle. The total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (4 * 33) + (1 * x) = 132 + x.

Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

To find the average temperature, we divide the total temperature by the total amount of water: (132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40.

Multiply both sides by 5: 132 + x ≥ 200.

Subtract 132 from both sides: x ≥ 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in one week, he gets 20 * 7 = 140 cows. In three weeks, he gets 140 * 3 = 420 cows. So, the total number of cows is 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day. In one week, he gets 10 * 7 = 70 chickens. In three weeks, he gets 70 * 3 = 210 chickens. So, the total number of chickens is 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens.

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm. Total animals = 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops. 
3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop. 
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days. 

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs in the first 30 days.

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs in the next 30 days.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide 240 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need.

240 / 12 = 20

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of green jellybeans = 17
Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the total non-blue jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = 60 (total) - 51 (non-blue) = 9

Since a decade is 10 years, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total number of parts is 5 + 9 = 14.

We know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. To find the number of passengers each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio.

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by 6 to find the number of women on the bus.

9 × 6 = 54

Now, we know that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remain on the bus, we subtract 20 from the total number of women.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply that by 3.

First, let's find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets by 12 to get the number of sunflowers from bouquets per day.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day from bouquets

Now, let's find out how many single sunflowers he sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers from bouquets and single sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate how much he spent, how much he made, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide $100 by $5:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

He buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, but he only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply 20 by 0.6 (which is the same as 60%):
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells 12 rocks for $7 each, so he makes:
12 * $7 = $84

He spent $100 to buy the rocks, but he only made $84. To find out how much he loses, we subtract $84 from $100:
$100 - $84 = $16

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes. 
45 / 5 = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. She needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes. 
36 / 6 = 6 days

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. She needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes. 
49 / 7 = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different types of scenes in the same day. So, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 6, and 7. The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. But that is not the answer because that is the LCM of the days, not the actual days. We need to find the least number of days that can be divided by 9, 6, and 7.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6.

60% of 5 minutes = 5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Since the second song is 60% longer, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to find Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 1 person. 

Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 100% by 20% to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand. 

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

Now, we need to multiply the number of bottles needed per person by the number of people to find out the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bottles the company can produce in a day from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles the company needs to produce.

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and bows, and how many babies are wearing bows in total.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple, so 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows. 
1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, let's subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

"Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. 

He sold half of the land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.

Then he sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so that's 20 * 3 = $60.

In total, he earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Since he changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to know how many eggs were hidden in the first place and how many were found.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs and 27 were found, the number of eggs still hidden is 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply that by the number of collections per week and the amount he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. Then we add 240 to 400 to get 640 apartments in the last complex.

Now we have a total of 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week, so we multiply 1040 by 3 to get 3120 collections per week.

John gets paid $.40 per collection, so we multiply 3120 by 0.40 to get his weekly earnings.

3120 * 0.40 = 1248

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We don't know the 10-year-old's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so 0 fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now that we know the 10-year-old tree's production, we can find the 8-year-old tree's production: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:
- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0
- Year 10: 1000

"Let's start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Length of blue rope = y - 7
= 12 - 7
= 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4(y - 7)
= 4(12 - 7)

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got 3 * $5 = $15.

Ronnie had $5 and Rissa had $15. They each gave an equal amount to their sister. Let's call that amount x.

After giving x dollars to their sister, Ronnie has $5 - x dollars left. Rissa has $15 - x dollars left.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15.

Expanding the left side, we get $75 - 5x = $60.

Now, let's solve for x: -5x = $60 - $75, so -5x = -$15.

Dividing both sides by -5, we get x = $3.

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left: $5 - x = $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to first find out how many pints of yellow paint were used. Since half the mural is yellow, we can find half of 12 pints.

12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the mural is divided into three colors: red, white, and purple. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, we can divide the remaining half by 3.

12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints remaining
6 pints / 3 = 2 pints of each color

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Since the new box costs $12, we need to find out how many pods we can get for $1.

"To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, we can find out how many bills he has by dividing $1000 by $20.
$1000 / $20 = 50 bills

Then, he loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Since each bill is $20, he has 40 * $20 = $800 left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. He uses 20 bills, which is 20 * $20 = $400.

He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left, which is 20 * $20 = $400.

Then, Thomas triples his money. He had $400, so tripling it will be $400 * 3 = $1200.

Now, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we can divide $1200 by $5.
$1200 / $5 = 240

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to figure out how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount he uses each day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. To find out how much chalk he used, we multiply 5 inches by 45% (or 0.45). 
5 x 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher started with 5 inches of chalk, we subtract the amount he used from the total to find out how much is left.
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now we know the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much chalk that is, we multiply the original length of the chalk (5 inches) by 20% (or 0.20).
5 x 0.20 = 1 inch

Now we need to find out how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk. We divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount he uses each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that he can't use the chalk when it's less than 2 inches. So we subtract the minimum length (2 inches) from the remaining chalk and then divide by the amount he uses each day.
2.75 - 2 = 0.75
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days

However, since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number because the teacher can't use the chalk for a fraction of a day. But we also need to consider the days it took to get to 2.75 inches of chalk. It took 1 day to get to 2.75 inches of chalk. So we add 1 day to the 0 days (since we rounded down from 0.75) and then add 2 more days because 0.75 is more than half of 1, so we can get 2 more days of use from the remaining 0.75 inch of chalk (0.75 / 0.25 = 3, but we already used 1 day, so 3 - 1 = 2).

Since the teacher can't use the chalk when it's less than 2 inches, we subtract the minimum length (2 inches) from the remaining chalk and then divide by the amount he uses each day.
2.75 - 2 = 0.75

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to first find out how many students are on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

In total, 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students are on varsity.

There are 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students in the class. If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist fixes and then divide that by the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

Now, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has: 15 / 30 = 0.5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to first find out how many gallons of milk he returned. 

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we multiply 4000 gallons by 2/5. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 
= 8000 / 5

Now, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, Wendy's current age is equal to five times Colin's age seven years from now. We can write this as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Now, let's look at the second statement. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that Colin's age 25 years from now is equal to one-third of Wendy's current age. We can write this as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5(C + 7)

Expand the right side:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

First, let's find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy. 
$27000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

Now, we know that 1 set has 100 books. So, 54 sets will have 54 * 100 = 5400 books.

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3.
5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree. So, he had 1 apple in his pocket.
3. The thrown apple caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, there are 5 + 1 (from step 2) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. So, he had 1 + 5 = 6 apples in his pocket and threw 1 apple.
5. The thrown apple caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Now, there are 6 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (6 from the ground) and added them to the 6 apples in his pocket.

So, Newton had 6 (from his pocket) + 6 (from the ground) = 12 apples.

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat. 

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so each friend eats 6 + 4 = 10 slices. Since there are 6 friends, they will eat 6 x 10 = 60 slices in total.

Now, let's calculate how many cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. 

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate will need 60 / 12 = 5 cheese pizzas. However, this is not correct because 60 slices is the total number of slices for both cheese and pepperoni pizzas. 

Let's calculate the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas separately. 

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so 6 friends will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so 6 friends will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many snowballs he can make in a certain amount of time, and then subtract the ones that melt.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we can calculate how many snowballs melt in an hour. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 / 15 = 4. So, 4 * 2 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

Now, we know Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 8 melt. So, he effectively makes 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs in an hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to divide 60 by 12. 

60 / 12 = 5.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to work backwards. 

On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. They ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. So, on the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the order. 

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so before the order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left. 

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they had 12 - 28 = -16 bandages left. But they can't have a negative number of bandages, so they must have had more bandages at the start. Since they had 3 bandages left at the end of the second day, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day. 

Since they had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the start of the first day, and they ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + 50 = 100 bandages. But they used 38, so they had 100 - 38 = 62 bandages left at the end of the first day. However, we know they had 31 bandages at the start of the second day, so they must have started with 31 + 31 = 62 bandages at the start of the first day is incorrect. 

Let's try again. They had 3 bandages left at the end of the second day, so they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day. They had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, so they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the start of the first day, and they ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + 50 = 100 bandages. But they used 38, so they had 100 - 38 = 62 bandages left at the end of the first day. However, we know they had 31 bandages at the start of the second day, so they must have started with 31 + 31 = 62 bandages at the start of the first day is incorrect. 

Let's try again. They had 3 bandages left at the end of the second day, so they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day. They had 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, so they must have had 12 + 38 = 50 bandages at the end of the first day. They ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + x = 50 + 50 bandages at the start of the first day, and they used 38, so they had 50 + x - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate. Then, we add the additional amount she receives for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, in a week, she works 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * 1.5 = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week. So, for 4 weeks, she receives 4 * 10 = $40.

First, let's calculate the interest. The interest is 2% of $300. To find 2% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.02. 
$300 * 0.02 = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (the amount he borrowed) + $6 (the interest) = $306.

Now, let's calculate the amount Stephen paid in the first 11 months. He paid $25 per month for 11 months. 
$25 * 11 = $275

Now, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes. 
$306 - $275 = $31

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first find out the total number of diapers changed per day. 

Since Jordan has 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers changed per day is 2 * 5 = 10 diapers.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we need to divide the total number of diapers by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to first calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. 

The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall, so its volume is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches. 

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 540 / 0.15 = 3600. 

However, the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, so the actual number of jelly beans in the jar is 3600 x 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans in the jar is 2880 x 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. 

To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract the actual number of red jelly beans from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people already on the bus and subtract that from the bus's capacity.

The bus started with 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered the bus at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third station is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people already on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find out how much Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost per year is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. The cost per year is now 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many groups of 8 students there are. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and each grade has 10 students who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is 4 x 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups. 
40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group uses. 
5 x 45 = 225 minutes

"Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and Ian cut it into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. 
So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining minutes, we subtract 16 from 36 to get 20 minutes. 
The cost for these 20 minutes is $0.2 per minute. 
So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining 20 minutes to get the total cost.
Total cost = $4 + $4 = $8.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats Carly needs to make is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, the sum of cupcakes and brownies is also 10. We can write this as an equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The cost of the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both, we need to find 20% of $75. To do this, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which is $15. So the discount is $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So the total cost of nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount to the cost of the nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

   So, the price of the toy in December was $40 + $32 = $72.

2. Then, we need to find the price of the toy after the discount in January. 
   The price decrease was 50% of $72. 
   50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so the total amount of money from these lessons is:
4 hours * $80 per hour = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with veterans at this rate, so the total amount of money from these lessons is:

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from 60 to find the remaining number of apples.
60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 25 and divide by 100.

The total distance is 200 yards. Half of the distance is on land, which is 200 / 2 = 100 yards. The other half is in water, which is also 100 yards.

Time to hop on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time to swim in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time to hop on land + Time to swim in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicles he needs to buy. 

Since each box has 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56, we can divide 56 by 8 to find out how many boxes he needs. 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicles. Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

There are 4 additional phones. So, the cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones. 
$20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.

His normal speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 450 by 10.

450 * 10 = 4500 words

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM. We can do this by dividing 4500 by 375.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped at four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The initial price of the boat is $9000.

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which is 30% of $9000. 
30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated by another 30%, which is 30% of $6300.
30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated by 20%, which is 20% of $4410.
20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Now, we need to add the money he would get for each half: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find out how many holes the dog dug, we need to multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day (6) by the number of days (14). 

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes (84) by the net number of holes filled per day (3).

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the number of days (28) by 7 to find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we multiply 4000 by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School to find the difference.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies: 
2595 (rainbow) + 3075 (oatmeal) = 5670

Now, let's subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal) = 2325

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to first figure out how many items Igor actually gathered. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He gathered the correct number of beakers, but we don't know how many he lost yet, so we'll call the number of beakers he gathered 'x'. We know he was supposed to gather 7 beakers.

We know the total number of items Igor gathered is 29. So we can set up an equation: 
8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers) = 29

Now we can solve for x: 
8 + 16 + x = 29
24 + x = 29
x = 29 - 24
x = 5

So Igor gathered 5 beakers. But he was supposed to gather 7 beakers. 
To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we subtract the number of beakers he gathered from the number of beakers he was supposed to gather: 
7 - 5 = 2

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate how many screws he needs in total. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, James needs 4 * 2 = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he needs 8 * 4 = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find out how many eggs are in the second basket and then add the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. So, the second basket has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to find out how much each person raised. 

Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the money raised by each person: 
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The total amount of money raised is $2180."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how fast he ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she can run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles. So, his speed is 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed. If Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa will run 2 miles in 32 minutes (which is twice 16 minutes).

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles and her speed is 2 miles in 32 minutes. To find out how long it took her to run 4 miles, we need to multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2. 

32 minutes * 2 = 64 minutes

"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. 

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

He already has 6 feet of line, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of line he needs.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

He needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and wine for each reservation. 

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 x $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make per week is 2 x $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.

25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40.

Now, we add the profit to the cost price: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To find the answer, we need to figure out how old James and Dora are now, and then find out how old John's youngest son is now. 

Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is 12 - 3 = 9 years old now. 
James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old now.

John was 19 when James was born, and James is 18 now, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour, we need to know how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we need to subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled. 

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400, but Mark got it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%). 
$400 * 0.8 = $320 (discount)
Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price Mark paid for the radiator.
$400 - $320 = $80

The cost of the mechanic's labor is $50 per hour, and it took 3 hours to install the radiator. 
$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.
$80 + $150 = $230

"Let's think about this problem. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We also know that there are 20 animals in total and they have 70 legs.

Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is '20 - c' (since there are 20 animals in total).

We can write an equation to represent the total number of legs:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying the equation:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70

Combine like terms:

-2c + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2c = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find out the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56 slices.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the slices equally. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.
