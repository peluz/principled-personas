"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating 3 for breakfast and baking muffins with 4:
16 (total eggs) - 3 (eaten for breakfast) - 4 (used for muffins) = 9 eggs

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg:
9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 100% (original value) + 150% (increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. To find 250% of the original value, we multiply $80,000 by 2.5 (since 250% = 2.5).

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. The repairs added $50,000 to the cost, but the increase in value is based on the original value of the house, not the cost. So, the selling price is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he runs in a week.

James runs 3 sprints a day, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a day is:
3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed required is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount required: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the full-priced glasses and the discounted glasses separately. 

Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of full-priced and discounted glasses. 
16 / 2 = 8 full-priced glasses
8 discounted glasses

The cost of the full-priced glasses is:
8 * $5 = $40

The cost of the discounted glasses is:
8 * $5 * 0.6 = 8 * $3 = $24

The total cost is the sum of the full-priced and discounted glasses:
$40 + $24 = $64

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into two parts: the initial download before the restart and the download after the restart.

Initially, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. 
Time to download 200 GB = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Total time = Time before restart + Time for restart + Time after restart
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes
Total time = 160 minutes

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he was initially away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was away from home is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours:
- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.
- He spent the next half-hour (0.5 hours) driving at 30 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled during the 4 hours is:
15 + 120 = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he traveled from the distance he was initially away from home:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime rate: $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour
Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads over the three months by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Total cost: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost of the tree is the initial cost of planting plus the annual cost of watering and feeding. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost is $90 (initial cost) + $3x (annual cost).

The total revenue is the number of lemons grown per year multiplied by the selling price per lemon, multiplied by the number of years. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue is 7 * $1.5 * x = $10.5x.

To start earning money, the total revenue should be greater than the total cost. We can set up an inequality:

$10.5x > $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x > $90

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x > $90 / $7.5
x > 12

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest whole number greater than 12 is 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

She then sold 2 more to the red house. 

Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners. 

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Now, to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the expected value of each investment after one month.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Expected growth rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Expected value after 1 month = Initial value * (1 + Expected growth rate)
Expected value after 1 month = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
Expected value after 1 month = $5,000 * 1.025
Expected value after 1 month = $5,125
Expected profit = Expected value after 1 month - Initial value
Expected profit = $5,125 - $5,000
Expected profit = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Expected growth rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Expected value after 1 month = Initial value * (1 + Expected growth rate)
Expected value after 1 month = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
Expected value after 1 month = $8,000 * 1.012
Expected value after 1 month = $8,096
Expected profit = Expected value after 1 month - Initial value
Expected profit = $8,096 - $8,000
Expected profit = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, the better option is to purchase the jewelry, which is expected to yield a higher profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. 

On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northwards.

Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered on each day: 80 miles (west) + 150 miles (north).

Total distance = 80 + 150
Total distance = 230 miles"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we will divide the total number of eggs by 12.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Time taken to walk the first 6 miles = 2 hours
Time left to walk the remaining 6 miles = Total time - Time taken to walk the first 6 miles
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can find Raymond's current age by adding 6 to Samantha's age:
Raymond's current age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - age at son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can express this as an equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of pizza by dividing the total cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11 lego sets.

So, he sold 11 lego sets and he had 13 lego sets initially.

3 hours + 2 * (3/2) hours = 3 + 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking and running speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

Let's denote her running speed as R. Since she can skip at half the speed she can run, we can set up the equation:

3 = R/2

To find R, we multiply both sides by 2:

R = 3 * 2
R = 6 miles per hour

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Let's denote her walking speed as W. We can set up the equation:

R = 4W
6 = 4W

To find W, we divide both sides by 4:

W = 6 / 4
W = 1.5 miles per hour

Now that we know Dana's walking and running speeds, we can find the distance she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

One-third of 6 hours is 2 hours, and two-thirds of 6 hours is 4 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 12 + 6
Total distance = 18 miles

New throwing distance = 400 * 3 + 400
New throwing distance = 1200 + 400
New throwing distance = 1600 feet

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we subtract 1000 from the new throwing distance to find the distance outside the reach of the flames where Polly can still hit the dragon.

Distance outside the reach of flames = New throwing distance - 1000
Distance outside the reach of flames = 1600 - 1000
Distance outside the reach of flames = 600

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. 
Calories left = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
Servings = Calories left / Calories per serving = 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. 
Grams per serving = 300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Grams you can eat = Servings * Grams per serving = 0.8 * 60g = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing 'x' more, she had 80 + x Post-it notes. She then used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is (80 + x) - 220. We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:
80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Eggs produced per day = 252 
Eggs produced per week = 252 * 7 
Eggs produced per week = 1764 

Now, let's find out how many dozens of eggs that is. 
1 dozen = 12 eggs 
Eggs produced per week = 1764 
Dozens of eggs per week = 1764 / 12 
Dozens of eggs per week = 147 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week.

"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we first need to find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Distance = Rate * Time. 
Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance is:
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles, and Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. 
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. This will give us the maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight of boxes by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight of boxes / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

Additional pension = 5% of $50,000 * 10 years
Additional pension = 0.05 * $50,000 * 10
Additional pension = $25,000

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. Since the tank was empty when she filled it up, the 4 gallons of gas were used to travel the 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles/gallon

Now, we know that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank.

Total miles = mpg * Total gallons

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
Since 18 is divisible by 2 (the number of flowers in the better package), Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each. 
The total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent bought 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50, he would need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6).

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) is 22.

However, we are not given any information about the number of games they drew. To solve this problem, we will assume that they either won or lost all the games (i.e., no draws).

We are given that they won 8 more than they lost, so we can write an equation:

W = L + 8

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:

W + L = 22

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Initial monthly salary: $600
10% increase: $600 * 0.10 = $60
New monthly salary after 1 year: $600 + $60 = $660

Since the 10% increase is based on the initial salary, the increase amount remains the same every year. 

New monthly salary after 2 years: $660 + $60 = $720
New monthly salary after 3 years: $720 + $60 = $780

Annual salary after 3 years: $780 * 12 = $9360"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find the expected number of attendees by multiplying the total number of invited friends by 3/4.

Expected attendees = 16 * (3/4) = 16 * 0.75 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can multiply the number of invited friends by 0.75.

Total gift bags = 16 * 0.75 = 12

However, we already calculated the expected attendees as 12, which is the same as the total gift bags. This is because the 0.75 gift bags per guest already accounts for the 1/4 of attendees not showing up.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total gift bags by the cost per gift bag.

Total cost = 12 * $2 = $24

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. 
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children eat half as much as adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. 
There are 5 children, so 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat.
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

"To find Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children. 

Let's denote Jackson's age as J, Amy's age as A, Corey's age as C, and James' age as 10 (since we know James' age).

We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so A = J + 5.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so A = C - 2.

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we have C = James' age + 1. Given James' age is 10, C = 10 + 1 = 11.

Now, we can find Amy's age using the relationship A = C - 2. A = 11 - 2 = 9.

Finally, we can find Jackson's age using the relationship A = J + 5. 9 = J + 5.

J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, we can find the number of rabbits:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys, which is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout, which is 120 - 80 = 40.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Now, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16, which gives us 4. This means that Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used. 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. We also know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. 

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 

To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass. This makes a total of 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 7 = 27.

First, we need to find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. This can be calculated by dividing the time by the distance: 10 minutes / 3 miles = 10/3 minutes per mile.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes to cover the whole city. Multiply the rate by the total distance: (10/3 minutes/mile) * 42 miles = (10 * 42) / 3 minutes = 420 / 3 minutes = 140 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:

Inner volume of one box = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
= 3 * 4 * 2
= 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * 3

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

First, we need to find the distance Julia rows per second. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, the total distance Julia rowed is:

Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find the total amount of water taken on, we can set up a proportion:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

Jamal's phone = 6 * B
We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

1800 = 6 * B

To find the value of B, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now we know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photograph. We can write an equation:

B = 50 * D
Substituting the value of B we found earlier:

300 = 50 * D

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

D = 300 / 50

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price (100% + 50% increase).
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by some percentage. However, we don't know the exact percentage. But we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later by adding the increase in Adrien's salary to Lylah's salary four years ago, assuming the same percentage increase for Lylah.

However, we are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% and we can use this information to calculate the total salary. We will assume Lylah's salary also increased by some percentage but we are not given that information. We can only calculate the total salary by adding the increase in Adrien's salary to Lylah's salary four years ago and Adrien's new salary.

However, we can calculate Lylah's new salary by using the same percentage increase as Adrien's. 
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later by adding Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the total: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, let's denote that number as 'x'. 

Since Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5. 

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, Julia had x + 5 - 3 spoons left. 

We are given that the total number of spoons Julia had when she went to set the table was 12. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:
x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:
x = 10

The number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10."
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to find the number of fish sausages first. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of chicken sausages = 38

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to find out how many friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of a watermelon and an orange.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
4 watermelons * $45 = $180
20 peppers * $15 = $300
10 oranges * $40 = $400

Total amount = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To find the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to calculate the total cost to the hospital and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost to the hospital is the total time spent by the doctors multiplied by the hourly rate:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is the total time spent by the doctors multiplied by the hourly rate charged to the patients:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the revenue minus the cost:
$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

"To find the miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to find the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28

Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W. Since W = 4Q, we get W = 4(100) = 400.

Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16. The total number of packs of cloths needed is 8.

The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of each pack of cloths is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so the profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive flew from the hive and left. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
So, the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned yet is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) - 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

We know that after the ants carried off a final french fry, there were 5 fries left. Before that, the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole 2/3x fries, and 1/3x fries remained. Since the ants carried off 1 fry and left 5, 1/3x = 5 + 1 = 6. 

Now, we can solve for x: 
1/3x = 6 
x = 6 * 3 
x = 18 

So, there were 18 fries before the raccoon stole some. Before that, the pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons. So, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. 

Now, let's call the number of fries before the pigeons ate some 'y'. Then, y - 9 = 18. 
y = 18 + 9 
y = 27 

So, there were 27 fries before the pigeons ate some. Before that, the seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 

Now, let's call the number of fries before the seagull ate some 'z'. Then, z - 7 = 27. 
z = 27 + 7 
z = 34 

So, there were 34 fries before the seagull ate some. This is the number of fries that were left after Dave ate 14.

"To calculate the price increase, we need to find the total number of 2-month periods in 36 months. Since 36 months is equal to 18 2-month periods, we will apply the 20% increase 18 times.

Initial price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Price after the first 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Price after the second 2 months = $20 + 2 * $4 = $28
However, this is not the correct way to calculate the price after multiple periods. We should calculate the price increase based on the original price for each period.

Price after the first 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Price after the second 2 months = $20 + 2 * $4 = $28 (Incorrect)
Correct calculation:
Price after the second 2 months = $24 + $4 = $28

To simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for exponential growth:
Price after n periods = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase rate * n)
However, this formula is also incorrect for this scenario, as the increase is based on the original price, not the current price.

Correct formula:
Price after n periods = Initial price * (1 + Increase rate)^n

Since the increase rate is 20% of the original price, we will use the original price as the base for the increase rate.
Price after 18 periods = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
However, this is still incorrect, as the increase rate is 20% of the original price, not 20% of the current price.

Correct calculation:
Price after 18 periods = $20 * (1 + 0.20/1)^18 is incorrect, the correct formula should be 
Price after 18 periods = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 is incorrect, the correct formula should be 
Price after 18 periods = $20 * (1 + 4/20)^18 is incorrect, the correct formula should be 
Price after 18 periods = $20 * (1 + 1/5)^18 is incorrect, the correct formula should be

The cost of one action figure is $5, and there are 3 action figures, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of all the toys together: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the cost of hiring the accountant and the lost income from doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35/hour, resulting in a total lost income of:
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

If she hires the accountant, she will pay $90.

The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is:
$105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to find out how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Number of eggs needed = Number of flans * Number of eggs per flan
Number of eggs needed = 15 * 3
Number of eggs needed = 45

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session.

Number of babysitting sessions = Total eggs needed / Eggs per session
Number of babysitting sessions = 45 / 9

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
Total payment per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two separate events and then compare them.

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. The probability of rolling one of these numbers is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die.
The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. To roll two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number by itself: (3/6) × (3/6) = 9/36, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities:
0.5 (Event 1) - 0.25 (Event 2) = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

5 times a week * 25 kilometers * 4 weeks = 5 * 25 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Distance for the next three weeks: 
2 times a week * 60 kilometers * 3 weeks = 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups and half a dozen plates.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16
= 8

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt, then divide that by her hourly wage.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which is the principal amount plus the additional 10% interest.

Principal amount = $2000
Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
Total amount owed = Principal amount + Interest = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is:
Total payments = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total payments from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:
Remaining balance = Total amount owed - Total payments = $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is:
Average age = (Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these up to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to calculate the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the changes.

Initially, James had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He lost 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32. He bought 14 grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards: 32/96 = 0.3333.

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories each of them consumed:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
Difference in calories = Sue's total calories - Sister's total calories
= 9200 - 3600
= 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes.

Since the school is 50% girls and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. 
The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both nights:
10 (wolves last night) + 15 (cougars last night) + 36 (wolves today) + 12 (cougars today) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.
21 * 4 = 84

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially). So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight to determine how much the termites ate.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the tree, we subtract the weight eaten from the total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bananas and apples Jamal has, and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Let's start with Jamal's fruits. We know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Let's call the number of apples Jamal has 'x'. Then the number of bananas Jamal has is 'x + 4'.

We also know Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples. So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now we can find the number of bananas Jamal has: x + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now we can find the total number of fruits: 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.
Total number of fruits = 76 + 92 = 168.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies Carla is making is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to get the total number of dozens. 
66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to get the total amount of flour Carla needs.
5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches. 
Collar stitches = 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. 
Rosette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves.
Total stitches for sleeves = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 10x - 10 = 39 (since they have 10 times less medals)

10x = 39 + 10
10x = 49

x = 49 / 10
x = 4.9

However, the number of medals must be a whole number. Therefore, the correct equation should be: x - 10 = 39 (since they have 10 times less medals)

x - 10 = 39
x = 39 + 10
x = 49

However, this is still not correct. The correct interpretation is that they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means they have 1/10 of the total medals. 

So, the correct equation is: x/10 = 39

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

First, convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Then, subtract the 30-minute break: 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals she works, divide the total working time by 10 minutes: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 per interval, multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first calculate the points each player has after 3 rounds and then add the extra points.

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

Mike's new total: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim's new total: 18 points (no change)
Tony's new total: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points of all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding pattern. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, it creates two pages on each side (front and back). This means that each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid.

Now, we need to divide the total number of pages (32) by the number of pages per piece of paper (4) to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 4 pages per piece of paper = 8

So, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 8.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and there are 50 unsold books left. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. Since she sold 45 books this year, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200 - 45 = 155.

We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, the number of books sold in the second year is 155 - 90 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * 2/3 = 60 * 2 / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left.

60 - 40 = 20

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/2.

20 * 1/2 = 20 / 2 = 10

Since half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon and 10 loaves are sold in the evening.

The number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Weight Joey loses in a week = Total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks / 4
Weight Joey loses in a week = 8 / 4
Weight Joey loses in a week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in a week, we can find out how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

Weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks = Weight Joey loses in a week
Weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks = 2 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and multiply by 4.

Number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = (Total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks / Weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks) * 4
Number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = (8 / 2) * 4
Number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 4 * 4

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names, as 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider 'RJ' as 'Richard' and use the value 5 for Richard.

So, the total number of guns is: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) = 23 guns.

Now, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people (4) to find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally.

23 guns / 4 people = 5.75 guns per person.

Since we can't divide guns into fractions, we can round down to 5 guns per person, with 3 guns left over. However, the question asks for the number of guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, so we'll consider the exact division result.

The final answer is: 5.75"

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chickens and cows, then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c'. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2c.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Number of chickens = 2c = 2(20) = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

Total legs = (Number of chickens * 2) + (Number of cows * 4)

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

So, let's set up an equation. Let x be the points Erin had before. Then, x + 14 is the points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, so x + 14 = 3 * 8. However, this is not correct. Erin has three times more points than Sara, so Erin's points now should be 3 times Sara's points, not 3 times 8.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan, which is:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount (initial amount borrowed) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.10/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

However, since the interest rate is given on a yearly basis and the loan is for 5 months, we can calculate the total interest first and then divide the total amount by the number of months.

Total interest = $3,650 * 10% * (5/12) = $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167 = $152.08
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Now, we can divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
M = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.42

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has:
2 * 50 (Axel's silver pesos) = 100 silver pesos
She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 40 = 120 gold pesos
The total number of pesos Anna has is:
100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

Now, let's add the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together:
130 (Axel's pesos) + 220 (Anna's pesos) = 350 pesos

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total cost. 

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

Now, let's find her total profit: $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, she will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, let's find her profit per hour: $18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of 1 part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio:

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of 1 part, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty's popsicles: 5 parts × 15 = 75

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first determine how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can multiply 12 by 1/3 to find out how many slices Bill got:
12 * 1/3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can multiply 12 by 1/4 to find out how many slices Mark got:
12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

Now, let's add up the slices that Jenny gave away:
4 (to Bill) + 3 (to Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, the total number of slices that are gone is:
7 (given away) + 2 (eaten by Jenny) = 9 slices

Since the pizza had 12 slices initially, we can subtract the slices that are gone to find out how many slices are left:

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:
- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total amount of flour needed by 2 to find the number of bags:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk needed by 2 to find the number of bottles:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees).

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest trees) + 45 (shortest trees) = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500

Subtract 145 from both sides:

x = 355

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 355.

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's original elevation. 

Stanley's original elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. We can do this by subtracting Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb.

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from both banks.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the normal rate period, and the increased rate period.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months (introductory) - 8 months (normal rate) = 10 months at $14 per month.
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to get the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Lillian also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to both types of feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

The cost of the bagel is $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the bagel, soup, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"To find the number of cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is:
$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then:
2/3 * x = 100

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs that were not available is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog was missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of missing hotdogs, which is 26.

However, this is not the case. The 26 missing hotdogs are the difference between the 80 hotdogs requested and the 54 hotdogs prepared. The 54 hotdogs prepared were enough for 54 guests to have one hotdog and 18 guests to have two hotdogs, for a total of 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. The 54 hotdogs prepared were enough for 27 guests to have two hotdogs (54 / 2 = 27), and 27 guests to have one hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up, 40 - 27 = 13 guests did not get a second hotdog.

To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost before the discount.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. 

So, 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips and then determine how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = 1.20 dollars

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he spent is:
5 - (5 * 0.01) = 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars:
4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 dollars

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:
3.75 / 0.75 = 5

Since he shared the lollipops equally with his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: Width = Area / Length.

Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth bought a total of:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth bought = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' total time. We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

James' run time = Total time - (Swim time + Bike ride time)

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can multiply the speed of the horse (32 miles per hour) by the time it runs (0.5 hours) to get the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, we can multiply the distance by 1/2 to get the total amount of hay eaten:

Total hay = Distance * 1/2
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is $3 per bail, so we can multiply the total amount of hay by the cost per bail to get the total cost:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 * $5 = $30

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has to get the change:

Change = Total money - Total cost

2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

To find the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:
4500 / 2250 = 2.

The farmer needs to make 2 trips."
"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first find the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

Number of basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards
Total number of cards = 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are given to her students.
Number of cards given to students = 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10. After receiving a 10% discount, Kelly paid $10 - (10% of $10) = $10 - $1 = $9.

The difference in the amount Kelly paid and Becky paid is $9 - $8 = $1.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got:
200 (initial) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 5 - 2
(x/2) = 3

Now, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate x:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to determine the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total number of students.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the fraction of students who do not have a desktop computer is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents 1/4 of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:

(1/4) * Total = 20

To solve for the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total = 20 * 4
Total = 80

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we find the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts. We add the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6), but since we counted the kids allergic to both twice, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both (3). 

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to feed the horses for 5 days. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides separately, then add them together.

Morning rides: 14 days * 2 rides/day = 28 rides. Each ride costs $6, so the total cost of morning rides is 28 rides * $6/ride = $168.

Afternoon rides: 14 days * 1 ride/day = 14 rides. Each ride costs $2, so the total cost of afternoon rides is 14 rides * $2/ride = $28.

Total cost = cost of morning rides + cost of afternoon rides = $168 + $28 = $196.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2 or B = 2D.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

The total number of insects found is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting B = 2D and L = D + 7 into the equation, we get:
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43
Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36
Divide by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

Width of rug = Width of chair + 5
Width of rug = 3 + 5
Width of rug = 8

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can find the length of the couch as follows:

Length of couch = 2 * Width of rug + 2
Length of couch = 2 * 8 + 2
Length of couch = 16 + 2

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option for buying lumber.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

- For 2 x 4: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
- For 2 x 8: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 66.67 sticks per dollar is more than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 lumber is the most cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of lumber Frederick can buy with $24:

$24 / $6 per 2 x 8 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber

Since each 2 x 8 piece of lumber yields 400 sticks, the total number of sticks is:

4 pieces * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

"To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought individually.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let x be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let y be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, so 4x = 12.
Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 4 = 3.

Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought, so 4y = 4.
Solving for y, we get y = 4 / 4 = 1.

Now, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding x and y.
Total = x + y = 3 + 1 = 4.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Initial daily consumption: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
New daily consumption: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take the same person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time for half a house).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the total time it would take to paint a whole house would be the total time for one person divided by the number of people:
240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has, then find the number of chairs Jenna has, and finally find the number of sofas Jenna has.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs that they have:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

The total cost of the items Tom bought is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. To do this, we divide the cost of the headphone set ($44) by the cost of a CD ($4). 

$44 / $4 = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4-hour routine, and then add the hours spent in the weeks with the 5-hour and 6-hour routines.

Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since 2 weeks were 5 hours and 1 week was 6 hours). So, the total hours spent in the 4-hour weeks are 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the two consecutive weeks with 5 hours each, the total hours spent are 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week with 6 hours, the total hours spent are 6 hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

Total hours spent working out: 36"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be J and his cousin's current age be C.

Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is:
J = 27 - 5
J = 22

In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
J + 8 = 22 + 8
J + 8 = 30

In 8 years, his cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age:
C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55

Now, let's find C, the cousin's current age:
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

The difference in their current ages is:
J - C = 22 - 47 (no, this is not correct, we need to find the absolute difference)
|J - C| = |22 - 47| 
|J - C| = 25

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + 2 * Cost of monitor + Cost of printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2 * Cost of monitor + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

$1,100 + $700 = $1,800
$1,800 + 2 * Cost of monitor = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides of the equation:

2 * Cost of monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
2 * Cost of monitor = $600

Divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Cost of monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then calculate the total number of seashells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of seashells the boys brought is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 seashells.

Now, to find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells the girls brought by the number of girls. 

3000 / 10 = 300

"To find out how many candies Nick has, we first need to determine how many candies George had initially. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the equation:

Initial candies - 5 = 3

Let's represent the initial candies as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for 'x', we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

So George initially had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the initial number of candies George had by 2:

Nick's candies = 2 * 8
Nick's candies = 16

Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. 

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. So each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He later spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he tripled the $13, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April).

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then, he saves 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings in the first half is 15x (15 days * x dollars per day), and the total savings in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x (15 days * 2x dollars per day).

Since Elvis wants to save a total of $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Now that we know Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half:

2x = 2 * 25 = 50

So, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this, we get 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

However, the question asks about a hot day, but the information given is for cold and warm days. Since we don't have information about the hot day, we will assume the warm day is the closest we have to a hot day for this calculation.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
260 roses (ordered) - 160 roses (grown) = 100 roses

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of crayon muffins she can make. 

First, we need to find the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we assume each crayon can be divided into the same number of small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon is not given. We are given that 8 small pieces of crayons are needed to make one muffin crayon.

So, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of small pieces per muffin crayon, but first, we need to know the number of small pieces per crayon. Since we do not know the number of small pieces per crayon, we will assume that the 192 crayons are the small pieces.

Now, we divide the total number of small pieces (crayons) by the number of small pieces per muffin crayon.

192 / 8 = 24

Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. Since she can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon.

24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the total area of the bedroom and then multiply it by the cost of each component.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

Let's denote the starting value as 'x'. However, we are given that the starting value is 20. So, x = 20.

The first operation is to add the starting value to half the number: 
x + (x/2) = 20 + (20/2) 
= 20 + 10 
= 30

The next operation is to divide the resulting value by 5:

"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have, we need to first find out how many cards the brother has. Since the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has.

The boy has 5 cards.
The brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards.

Total number of cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we can apply the same percentage to the new set temperature.

New set temperature = x
Actual temperature = 520

We know that the actual temperature is 4% more than the set temperature, so we can set up the equation:

Actual temperature = Set temperature + (4% of Set temperature)
520 = x + (0.04x)

Combine like terms:
520 = 1.04x

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time for both movies:

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:
Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 2 boxes after the 10% discount:
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Price of 1 box after discount = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Price of 2 boxes after discount = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, let's calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
Number of contacts in 1 box = 90
Number of contacts in 2 boxes = 2 * 90 = 180

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:
Cost of each pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Total number of contacts

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics at 500 calories/hour, so she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics. 

She also spent 1 hour running at 600 calories/hour, so she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned: 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water needed per unit: 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

From the given information, we know:
1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. R + B + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the expressions for R and G from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3), we get:
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide by 3:
B = 1500

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional amount. 

Now, subtract the cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount:
$50 - $42 = $8

"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter needed per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed per day is:
4 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for a week, which has 7 days, the total amount of butter needed is:
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost to repave Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

To find the cost of repaving Monica's street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 

The funding for the additional months is 50% more than the initial funding per month. The initial funding per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 

50% more than $20,000 is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000 per month.

The total cost for the additional 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial funding and the cost of the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Total ounces of meat consumed by the team:

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

Assuming a non-leap year, March has 31 days.

Total posts per day = 1000 members * 3 posts per day per member = 3000 posts per day

Total posts in March = 3000 posts per day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

The 2 bags of rocks cost 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The 3 pieces of coral cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The 20 fish cost 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add the costs together:

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so its height became 2 * 3 = 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells per day and then divide the weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat per hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg per day.

Now, we divide the weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg):

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not working. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then add them together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times, so it has 1000 - 356 = 644 plays left.
DVD 2 has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, we add the remaining number of plays for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours each time. 
So, the total number of hours per week is 2 sessions * 2 hours = 4 hours.
The total number of hours for 6 weeks is 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125. 
The total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to find out her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to get her current age.

Current age = 16 - 12
Current age = 4

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.

Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

First, we know that 1 hour has 60 minutes, and 1 minute has 60 seconds. So, the total number of seconds in an hour is:
60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds/hour

Now, we can convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to kb per hour:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb/hour

Next, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we can convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
72,000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to find the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we know that Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. To find out how many inches he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take him to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

"To find James' commission, we first need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars. 
So, the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. 
So, his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

$17,500"
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * 2000
= 1600

Now, we are given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, the price of a silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - 400
= 1600 - 400
= 1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. 

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. 

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom and is driving at 55 miles per hour, the distance Bob covers in 't' hours is 55t miles. 

Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, so the distance Tom covers in 't' hours is 70t miles.

Since Tom needs to cover the initial distance between them (75 miles) plus the distance Bob covers in 't' hours, we can set up the equation:

70t = 55t + 75

Subtracting 55t from both sides:

15t = 75

Dividing both sides by 15:

t = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. 

Let's divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes he can attend: 
$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers that Jewel does. 

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 * 4
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To find Lynn's distance, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple:
$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30 per apple

Now, let's find the cost of 5 apples:
5 apples × $1.30 per apple = $6.50

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange:
$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10 per orange

Now, let's find the cost of 5 oranges:
5 oranges × $1.10 per orange = $5.50

Finally, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth:
Time = Volume × time per cubic foot
Time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The towing package is not given a price, so we will assume it is $0 for this calculation.
The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of each feature to the base price:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $0 (towing package) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

"To find out how much candy each of them would have, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount of candy by 3, since they are sharing it equally among themselves.

Candy each of them would have = Total amount of candy / 3
= 12 / 3

"To find the change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

The total cost of the candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days Christina had. We know that her first eight days were good, and then she had two more good days after the initial 24 days (since the next three days were good, neutral, and good). 

So, the total number of good days is 8 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) + 2 (from the 12 total good days - 8 initial good days - 2 additional good days = 2 good days in the 3rd set of 8 days) = 12.

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we already know the total number of good days is 12, and we know that 10 of those good days have already passed (8 in the first set of 8 days and 2 in the last set of 6 days), we subtract the good days that have passed from the total number of good days.

12 (total good days) - 10 (good days that have passed) = 2.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 
2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2:
(2x) / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the current height from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
Current height = 20 feet
Current height in inches = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches).

Height difference = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the height difference by the growth rate to find the number of days.

Number of days = Height difference / Growth rate
= 360 / 30
= 12

"To find the total number of toys James needs, we'll break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys. Now, James has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James returns, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 12 dogs (4 initial + 8 additional) when he left, there are now 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs. So, James needs 24 more toys.

Now, James has 12 (toys he already had) + 24 (additional toys) = 36 toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. Therefore, James now needs 36 - 3 = 33 toys.

"To find Skyler's investment, we need to calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances first.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = (2 * $1200) / 5 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances' investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = (2 * $720) / 3 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days, working 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 3 hours/day * 2 days
Total hours worked = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings:

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
Total earnings = 6 hours * $20
Total earnings = $120

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 
6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

Now, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 6 to find the number of hash browns per potato:
1 potato : 36/6 = 6 hash browns

Now that we know 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, we can multiply this by the total number of potatoes (96) to find the total number of hash browns:
96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 150% of the original length, or 1.5x. 

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To find the total time taken, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together.

Time taken in turtle mode for half the lawn: Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in turtle mode, he can mow half the lawn in half the time, which is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Time taken in rabbit mode for half the lawn: Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, he can mow half the lawn in half the time, which is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as 't' and the age of one of the triplets as 'r'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as:

t = r + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:

2t + 3r = 44

Now, we can substitute the expression for 't' from the first equation into the second equation:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Expanding the equation:

2r + 14 + 3r = 44

Combine like terms:

5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5r = 30

Divide by 5:

r = 6

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

t = r + 7
t = 6 + 7
t = 13

The age of one of the twins is 13."

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, we can find the cost of 4 candies by subtracting the cost of 5 lollipops from $3.20. 

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This is the cost of 4 candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide $1.20 by 4.

$1.20 / 4 = $0.30

Now we know that one candy costs $0.30. We can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one lollipop and one candy by 10 and adding them together.

10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to determine how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to calculate 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.

2/5 * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and there are 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

The total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of people attending the function.

The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Total chairs currently available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 adults + 15 babies = 57.

Since babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need to ensure there are enough chairs for each. There are 15 babies, and there are 8 high chairs available, which is not enough for the babies. However, we can assume that some adults can use the high chairs if needed, or we can consider getting more high chairs. For simplicity, let's assume we'll get more high chairs to accommodate the babies.

We need 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs for the babies.

For the adults, we have 42 adults and 40 regular chairs available, which is not enough for the adults. We need 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs for the adults.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To find out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy, we need to determine how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can purchase with $6.00.

Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, we divide the total amount Erin has ($6.00) by the cost of each set ($3.00) to find out how many sets she can buy: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, we multiply the number of sets by 3 to find the total number of scoops: 2 * 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them has left.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 4 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. So, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. So, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Now, let's find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger. Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces. The difference is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can calculate the area as follows:

Area to be covered = (2/3) * 36 sq ft
Area to be covered = (2 * 36) / 3
Area to be covered = 72 / 3
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. To find the total number of tiles needed, we can multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

Total tiles needed = Area to be covered * Tiles per square foot
Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft
Total tiles needed = 576

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten by each group of friends and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
3 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza * 2/3 = 3 * 12 * 2/3 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza * 3/4 = 2 * 12 * 3/4 = 18 slices

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The total number of slices initially is 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 2 * 10 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes 

Now, we can find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. If we let x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button and a large button is worth three small stickers, 27 small stickers are worth 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9). Now she has 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons. Now she has 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers and 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, for a total of 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Now, we add the small buttons: 87 + 60 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day:
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the sum of votes in favor and against, which is 2x + x = 3x.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33 to find the number of votes against the regulation.

Solving for x, we get x = 33 / 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

- Extra-small: 11 students
- Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3, since they represent one third of the Pomeranians.

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we have 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion or multiply the number of Pomeranians by 3/2, since they represent two thirds of the total puppies.

18 Pomeranians * (3/2) = 27 puppies

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house will need 2x cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so it will need 2x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

Since the third house needs double the first, it will need 2x = 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:
Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. 

Total time spent driving = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can set up the equation:

Hiking speed = (1/2) * Driving speed - 5
Hiking speed = (1/2) * 50 - 5
Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked by multiplying the hiking speed by the time spent hiking:

Distance hiked = Hiking speed * Time spent hiking
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Next, we can find the time spent driving by subtracting the time spent hiking from the total time:

Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
Time spent driving = 6 - 1.5
Time spent driving = 4.5 hours

Now, we can find the distance driven by multiplying the driving speed by the time spent driving:

Distance driven = Driving speed * Time spent driving
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Finally, we can find the total distance to the vacation spot by adding the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 225 + 30
Total distance = 255 miles

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Then Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. 
Points from enemies for Emma = 10x
Points from enemies for Ava = 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Then Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.
Points from berries for Emma = 5y
Points from berries for Ava = 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Then Ava finishes the level with 'z - 4' seconds left.
Points from time for Emma = 30z
Points from time for Ava = 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for each of them:
Total points for Emma = 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava = (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava = 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their scores = Total points for Ava - Total points for Emma

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but since it is stated that two pizzas cost 30 dollars, we can assume that the two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total, not each) 

So, the total cost of the two pizzas is 30 dollars.

Now, subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas:

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write the equation:

w + o = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide by 3:

w = 4

He drives to work from Monday to Friday, so the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 
So, we convert 1/4 to 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2) and keep 1/8 as it is.

Now, we add the fractions: 
2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8

This means 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart TVs or analog TVs. 
To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we subtract 3/8 from 1 (the total fraction of all TVs). 
1 can be written as 8/8. 

8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8

So, 5/8 of the total TVs sold are OLED TVs. 
Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we multiply 5/8 by 40 to find the number of OLED TVs sold.

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) = 220
220 + 20 (new employees in the second month) = 240
240 + 20 (new employees in the third month) = 260

So, the total number of employees after three months is 260.

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:
$1,040,000 per month * 3 months = $3,120,000

$3,120,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and add them together.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, so the total time for this song is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so the total time for this song is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to first find Nikita's score. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. 
Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we can find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita by adding their scores.
Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150
Total points = 428

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted: 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 
The number of stuffed goats will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x.

We know that the number of stuffed goats will be the difference between the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats (x) and the total number of stuffed animals she currently has (14). 
So, the number of stuffed goats = x - 14.

Since the number of stuffed goats is 0.3x, we can set up the equation:
0.3x = x - 14

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 14

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 20

This means the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats should be 20. 
Since she currently has 14 stuffed animals, the number of stuffed goats she should buy is:
20 - 14 = 6

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and gold, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900. To calculate the premium, we multiply $900 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%).
$900 * 0.30 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the cost of the diamond and gold to find the total cost.
$900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500.
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100.

The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * 40% = 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.
The total number of students who took the test is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test, which is 700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

700/1000 = 0.7 
0.7 * 100 = 70

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can find the total area of the mosaic by dividing the total number of chips by 12:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total area by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining amount of tea.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts
Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount of tea consumed:
Total tea at the beginning = Total tea consumed + Remaining tea
Total tea at the beginning = 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = Total tea at the beginning (quarts) / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 48 quarts / 4
Total tea at the beginning (gallons) = 12 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students

Total branches climbed = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by 7.

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 420 / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 60

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows left.

Initially, the bag has 35 marshmallows. John and DeSean used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows to make S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number of marshmallows to find the number of marshmallows left:
35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the marshmallows left is also 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we'll divide the total number of S'mores by 2:
14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the turtles will take twice as long as a kangaroo to travel the same distance.

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all four turtles to travel across the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle.

Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each of them made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the reduced price of the laptop.

The reduced price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk his current cows produce. 

The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total amount of milk produced by 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional milk needed by the milk produced per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the fraction used is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the fraction used is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the fraction used is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The least common multiple of 6, 3, and 2 is 6. 

So, we convert the fractions to have a common denominator of 6:
- The first glue stick: 5/6
- The second glue stick: 1/3 = 2/6
- The third glue stick: 1/2 = 3/6

Now, we add the fractions of the glue sticks that are used: 
5/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 10/6 = 5/3

Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the total length of the glue sticks used is 5/3 * 12 = 20 millimeters.

However, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. Since there are 3 glue sticks, the total length of all the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 's' and the number of dishes Jack has as 'd'. 

Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store, we can write an equation:
d = 2s

We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so:
d = 60

Substituting d = 60 into the equation d = 2s, we get:
60 = 2s
s = 60 / 2
s = 30

So Jack has 30 socks.

Now, we are given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has:
2 * 30 = 60 socks

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

Let's denote the total number of students as T = 20, the number of students good at math only as M = 5, the number of students good at English only as E = 8, and the number of students good at both math and English as B.

We know that the total number of students is the sum of the students good at math only, English only, and both math and English. So, we can write the equation as:

T = M + E + B

Substituting the given values, we get:

20 = 5 + 8 + B

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 20 - 5 - 8
B = 7

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage.

Now, we can divide the available time for performances by the time taken by each group to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned per year remains the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years is $225 * 3 = $675.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is the principal amount plus the total interest earned: $300 + $675 = $975.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14 = 18
Glasses sold by Micah = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Difference = 14 - 9 = 5

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope:
Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total profit = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total profit = 20 * 2
Total profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming she wants the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Total cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Total cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Total cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over:
Money left over = Total profit - Total cost of the new rope
Money left over = 40 - 30
Money left over = $10

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of one pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert (excluding the encore) is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The final answer: 25"

20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 microphones.

Since 10 microphones won't find any space, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 50 - 10 = 40 microphones.

Now, to find the number of pairs, we divide the number of microphones by 2 (since each pair has 2 microphones).

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

Given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can substitute this value into the equation:

121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba, we'll assume they paid the same amount per mow as Joe. 

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
6 (from Joe) + 6 * 3x (from Kamala) + 6 * 5x (from Alba)
= 6 + 18x + 30x
= 6 + 48x

However, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade. We also know that she made 6 + 48x from mowing lawns. 

Since the problem states that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that x = 1 (i.e., she mowed Joe's lawn once). 

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
6 + 48 * 1
= 6 + 48
= 54

Now, we can find out how much she made from lemonade sales by subtracting the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
80 (total) - 54 (mowing lawns)

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
1/5 of Dijana's distance = 1/5 * 50 = 10 miles
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + 1/5 of Dijana's distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make. 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
Material needed for 20 small masks = 5 sets * 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make. 
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards (round up to 3 sets since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate with 2.67 sets for accuracy)
Material needed for 8 large masks = 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards

27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea cups) = 12 cups

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea in each row is:

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

As there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

4 cups per row / 2 = 2 cups per row

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to calculate the amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount his parents gave him.

Colby saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50.
He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2), so the total cost for the night will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can see 1 more movie."
"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to first calculate the calories in each mini pastry and then multiply it by the number of pastries.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, which is:
600 * 1/3 = 200 calories

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, which is:
450 * 1/3 = 150 calories

Now, we multiply the calories in each mini pastry by the number of pastries:
Mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories * 200 = 40,000 calories
Mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories * 300 = 45,000 calories

Total calories in the pastries = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference.

Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
= 300 miles - 240 miles
= 60 miles

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation:
(L + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute L = J + 10 into the equation:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Maria's friends initially had 4 * 2 = 8 water balloons. 
Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. 
So, the total initial number of water balloons was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends). 
So, the total additional number of water balloons was 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial and additional number of water balloons to find the total: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To find out how many new tables the charity group needs, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They also have 10 boxes already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need in total. 
60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables they need. 
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:
Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
The cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he will be charged for 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5). The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the amount of money Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option: 
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * (amount each goat needs) - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Amount each goat needs
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Amount each sheep needs
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining money is:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining money is:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining money is:

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters per word = 300 letters.

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

Since James got a 40% discount, the amount he saved is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age.

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total minutes: 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

Distance = Rate * Time

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance will be subtracted from the total distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:
Total Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones from her office, and the ones her friends brought. 

Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. 
Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies. 

To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies. 
Brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut, the time is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
For the 5 racquets with polyester string, the time is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
For the 4 racquets with hybrid sets, the time is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each phone. 

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. 
The cost of the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones (for the 2 kids) are half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. 
The cost of the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the remaining 2 phones.
Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"To find the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box. 

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges.

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we multiply 160 by 1/4 or divide by 4.

160 / 4 = 40 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges to find the number of oranges she sold.

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate India's number of states as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
Number of states in India = 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Since they are sharing 60 cherries in total, Jerry has 60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days and then multiply by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10 + 15 = 25.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective costs:
25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

The total amount earned is $150 + $390 = $540.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100
= 0.4 * $100
= $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car
= $100 - $40

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (5 years before Emil turns 24).

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old (5 years before Emil turns 24).

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:
Dad's age: 43
Brother's age: 7
Sum of their ages: 43 + 7 = 50

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the pounds of crawfish he caught on each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players.
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players.
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Next, let's find the number of cheerleaders and band members. 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space each plant occupies, including the space between plants. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant.

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant occupies.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because the last plant would not have enough space). However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract those from the total.

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost per plant.

27 plants * $6/plant = $162

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 apiece, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 apiece, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have (30 pounds) to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

Number of roses = Soil left for roses / 1 pound/rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, then add the two times together.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes her to sauté 1 shrimp, we divide 10 minutes by 30 shrimp: 10 / 30 = 1/3 minute per shrimp. To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 * (1/3) = 30 minutes.

The total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. The total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backwards.

Let's assume Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 * 30
x = 90

This means Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, we can subtract 75 from 90 to find Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time:

Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time = 90 - 75
Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time = 15

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W' and the age of Helene as 'H'. We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, we can write the equation:

H = 2 * (Total age / 4)
H = 2 * (20 / 4)
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the first equation:

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the ratio of the slices. 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 6 slices.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total size is 4x (kids) + 2(2x) (adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total size of the watermelon (8x) and multiplying by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time:

4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = Length × Width × Height

Given the dimensions of the pool:
Length (L) = 25 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet
Height (H) = 4 feet (depth)

Volume = L × W × H
Volume = 25 × 14 × 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed:
Gallons = Volume × 5.9
Gallons = 1400 × 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool at $0.10 per gallon:
Cost = Gallons × $0.10
Cost = 8260 × $0.10
Cost = $826

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is:
9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14 blue sticks

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks:
14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
9 (red sticks) + 14 (blue sticks) + 11 (yellow sticks) = 34

"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the number of laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps:
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons
Total water pumped: 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end was 28%, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Charge after 3 hours = Charge before 3 hours * (1 - 0.07)^3
28% = Charge before 3 hours * (0.93)^3

Now, we can solve for the charge before 3 hours:
Charge before 3 hours = 28% / (0.93)^3
Charge before 3 hours ≈ 32.41%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up another equation:

Charge after 5 hours = Initial charge * (1 - 0.09)^5
32.41% = Initial charge * (0.91)^5

Now, we can solve for the initial charge:
Initial charge = 32.41% / (0.91)^5
Initial charge ≈ 51.23%

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly income is $10 + $15 = $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly income is $25 * 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2,000) by her weekly income ($1,000).

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the amount left for plums is $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we can find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75 at $0.25 each.

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

"To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we first need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. 

Number of selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Number of selfies = 9 * 3
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains the same.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:

40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total number of questions to find the remaining questions.
60 - 24 = 36 questions.

Now, we divide the remaining questions by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions.
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correctly, so we calculate 75% of 24.
75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correctly, so we calculate 50% of 18 for both average and difficult questions.
50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions correct and 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, we add the number of easy, average, and difficult questions Aries is sure to get correctly.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa's total earnings from the sales of large and small stuffed animals is $120. This can be expressed as:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 
50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds.

The number of green balloons remains the same, 7.

When Sally released half of the yellow balloons, the number of yellow balloons she released is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the remaining yellow balloons are 12 - 6 = 6.

Now, Sally had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 28 (the balloons she already had) + 6 (the blue balloons she added) = 34.

"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8: 21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 0.375 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over 3 years (from 2007 to 2010). 

The formula for exponential decay is given by:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where A(t) is the amount at time t, A0 is the initial amount, r is the rate of decay, and t is the time.

Given A0 = $20000, r = 21% or 0.21, and t = 3 years, we can plug in the values:

A(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
A(3) = 20000 * (0.79)^3
A(3) = 20000 * 0.493039
A(3) = 9867.80

Price of the car in 2010: $9867.80"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the number of English and German books.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)
= 50 - (25 + 5)
= 50 - 30

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to calculate the total distance she has driven so far and subtract it from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers
Number of days = 4

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. 
To find out how many gallons she drinks, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people is:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, so the number of people left is:
140 - 50 = 90

At the same stop, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100 people. So, the total number of people is:
90 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people left is:
190 - 80 = 110

Total number of people on the train at the final stop:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the entire area. 

Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Given the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of each tile:

Number of tiles = Total area / Area of each tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12/tile
= $2400

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

A twin set of sheets consists of 1 sheet for the top and 1 sheet for the bottom, and a king set of sheets also consists of 1 sheet for the top and 1 sheet for the bottom. However, the laundry machine's capacity is given in terms of sets of sheets, not individual sheets.

Since Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, and the laundry machine can only allow 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week as follows:

- For the twin beds: 4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads
- For the king size bed: 1 king set per load = 1 load

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is:
3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year

"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in a weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, the total number of movies they watch in a weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 
100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food eaten per day is:
3 cats * 2 meals * 60 grams = 3 * 2 * 60 = 360 grams per day

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the amount eaten per day (360 grams):
720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we first need to determine the number of slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

However, we also know that there are 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the maximum number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32. Since the total number of slices eaten (31) is less than the total number of slices available (32), the total number of slices eaten is indeed 31.

"Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x' minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18' minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's part is 'x + 18', we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of 2 hours of parking at $6/hour is $6 * 2 = $12.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Total number of pizzas left = 6 (from the glee club) + 8 (from the football team) = 14

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of successful trucks by the tons of fertiliser per truck to find the total tons of fertiliser delivered:

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the difference between the number of bales the farmer makes and the number of bales the truck picks up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time on weekends, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. 

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes per week on extra learning time. However, this is the total for both Saturday and Sunday, so this is correct.

The total minutes he spends learning per week is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the first bounce and then the height of the second bounce.

The initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of its initial height: 72 * 2/3 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of the height of the first bounce: 48 * 2/3 = 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the other children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12:
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find the total earnings of the orchard, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5).

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the information given.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means the velociraptors left 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the T-Rex left 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the initial weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and 3 of them were shaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability (%) = 0.25 * 100

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days he works.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works:
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:
6 * 40 = 240 people.

Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
The discounted price of the frying pan is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
The discounted price of the towels is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Sheila's new purchases total:
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

To find the number of large jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 3:

large jellyfish = 6 * 3
large jellyfish = 18

Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. We can set up the equation:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% * $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = 0.4 * $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her desired annual retirement income for 20 years. We'll use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate her retirement savings goal:

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r

where r is the interest rate (we'll assume 4% for this calculation) and n is the number of years in retirement (20 years).

Retirement savings goal = $40,000 * (1 - (1 + 0.04)^(-20)) / 0.04
Retirement savings goal ≈ $548,739.49

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary:

Annual savings = 20% * $100,000
Annual savings = 0.2 * $100,000
Annual savings = $20,000

To calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
Number of years to reach goal ≈ $548,739.49 / $20,000
Number of years to reach goal ≈ 27.44 years

Since Lauren has already been working (we don't know for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she would need to work for approximately 27.44 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she wants to retire in 27.44 years and live for 20 years in retirement, and she is currently 0 years old for simplicity, she would be 47.44 years old when she retires. If we assume she wants to retire at 65, she would need to work for 17.56 more years (65 - 47.44)."

0.4 * total students = 240

Now, we can solve for the total number of students:
total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find the number of girls by calculating 60% of the total students:
Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted:
Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x
We are given that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so:
40 = 2 / x
x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2x)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 / (2 * 1/20)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 / (1/10)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. This is $60 - $32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4). 

$28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We are given that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. 

Let's represent the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we can find the number of marbles he will have left by subtracting 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x' degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. The temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees

Multiply both sides by 5 ounces to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + 1 * x = 5 * 40

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Since the temperature of the second mug must be at least this value, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately.

Initially, there are 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470.

Initially, there are 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of chickens brought in a week is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

The 10% discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

(9/14) = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were 54 women initially on the bus. 

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is:
54 - 20 = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:

84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100, and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find 60% of 20 rocks:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

12 * 7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. To draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. To draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. To draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day, we need to find the most efficient way to complete the project. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of picture scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. However, this is not the correct answer because it is the LCM of the days, not the actual days it will take to complete the project.

To find the actual number of days, we can calculate the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together, but this will not give us the correct answer because Lauren can only work on one type of picture scene per day.

A better approach is to calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of picture scenes by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes, 6 medium-sized picture scenes, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. To find the total number of days, we can divide the total number of picture scenes by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day.

Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

To find the total number of days, we can add the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene.

However, we can also calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of picture scenes by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day.

Let's calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project.

Total large-sized picture scenes = 45
Total medium-sized picture scenes = 36
Total small-sized picture scenes = 49

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 days.

Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take her 36 / 6 = 6 days.

Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take her 49 / 7 = 7 days.

To find the total number of days, we can add the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene.

However, we can also calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the project by dividing the total number of picture scenes by the number of picture scenes Lauren can draw per day.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to find the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then multiply them together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning to find the probability that both tickets are winners:
20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total. 

Let's start with Carlos. We know Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 
Jim: 27
Carlos: 22
Carrey: 11
Total: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and Mason eats 4 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
5 * 4 = 20

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required for one person. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required amount: 
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, the number of babies wearing purple is:
8 * (3/4) = 6

The number of babies wearing blue is:
8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers (6 babies) also wear bows:
(1/3) * 6 = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and multiply by 100:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount earned from each sale and add them together.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

Now, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add the amount earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so his total weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = production of an 8-year-old tree, and we know that x = 1000. 
So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total production for 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation:
R = 4B

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation:
B = Y - 7

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
R + B + Y = 37

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Substituting the second equation into the above equation, we get:
5B + (B + 7) = 37
Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)

Initially, Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's denote the amount they gave as x. So, Ronnie has 5 - x left, and Rissa has 15 - x left.

It is given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Number of pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is:
$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is also $0.10. To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. Since each bill is $20, the amount of money he has left is 20 * $20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money. So, he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by $5: $1200 / $5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we first need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday, leaving 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk.

Since the teacher now goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk.

20% of the remaining chalk is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

To find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used per day: 
2.75 / 0.55 = 5 days.

However, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. So we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

Let's calculate how much chalk will be left after 4 days:
2.75 - 0.55 * 4 = 2.75 - 2.2 = 0.55 inches.

After 4 days, the teacher will have 0.55 inches of chalk left, which is less than the 2 inches required to write. However, we should also consider that the teacher will use 0.55 inches of chalk on the 5th day, so he will actually run out of chalk on the 5th day.

However, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Since the chalk will be 0.55 inches after 4 days, the teacher will have to recycle it on the 5th day, but he can still use it for 4 days.

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes (1 hour). 
Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. In 60 minutes, he loses 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).

The net rate at which Jay builds snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs at this rate. 

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 / 12
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference and then apply it to Jim's age.

Since John is 28 now and the anniversary marks 20 years since Digimon came out, we can find John's age at that time by subtracting 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and 75 of those came from the third day's order. This means they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left from the first day.

However, we know they had 3 bandages left from the first two days. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

Since they had 12 bandages left from the first day, they must have had 31 - 12 = 19 bandages at the start of the first day, in addition to the 50 they ordered.

Therefore, the total number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19 + 50 = 69.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours for the month is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:

"To find the cost of the scotch per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find the cost of cognac per bottle, we calculate 50% of $60 and add it to $60: 
50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
Cost of cognac per bottle = $60 + $30 = $90

Now, we find the total cost of cognac by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height. Since the base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, the area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the total volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Given that a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches and the jar has an 80% packing efficiency, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans the jar can hold. First, we multiply the total volume by the packing efficiency: 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches. Then, we divide this volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, and Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the discount.

The price in November was $40. 
In December, the price increased by 80%, so we need to find 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so we need to find 50% of $72 and subtract it from the price in December.
50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie earns $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he earns:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60

Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at this rate, so he earns:
2 hours * $60/hour = $120

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is the sum of the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran:
$320 + $120 = $440

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he was left with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he was left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he traveled and then multiply it by his average speed.

First, we convert the time from days to hours: 
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books a single bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

Total cost = 5 dozens x $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1, so the price per egg is $1/3.
Total revenue = 60 eggs x $1/3/egg = 60/3 = $20.00

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write another equation:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. Since Dallas dropped 4 marbles and ended up with 21, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas initially received by adding the dropped marbles to the remaining marbles.

Dallas initially received: 21 (remaining marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles

Now, we know Mazie had 52 marbles and gave 25 to Dallas. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

Marbles given to Darla: 52 (total marbles) - 25 (marbles given to Dallas) = 27

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:
