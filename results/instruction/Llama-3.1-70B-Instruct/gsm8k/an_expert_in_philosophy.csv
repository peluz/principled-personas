"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. 

First, we know that Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, we subtract the eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid by the ducks: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house after the repairs and then subtract the total cost from it.

The initial value of the house was $80,000. After the repairs, the value increased by 150%. To calculate the new value, we need to find 150% of the initial value and add it to the initial value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost for Josh is $80,000 (initial cost) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost. Therefore, the profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, each of 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a single session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we first need to calculate the total daily feed for 20 chickens. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total daily feed is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the first two meals is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the first two meals from the total daily feed: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of the subsequent glasses. 

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3. 

Now, let's break down the cost of the 16 glasses:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- This pattern continues until the 16th glass.

We can group the glasses into pairs of two, with each pair consisting of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3. There are 8 such pairs in 16 glasses.

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.
The cost of 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to establish a relationship between the number of sheep in each city. 

Let's start with Seattle, which has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. We can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle
Total = 160 + 80 + 20
Total = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial download before the restart and the download after the restart.

First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. Since she downloads 40% of the 200 GB file, we can calculate this as follows:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes her to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes her to download the entire file is:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update and the 40 minutes she spent downloading before the restart. Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is:

40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance John covered during the initial 3 hours of driving at 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours 
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering no distance. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 15 miles

The remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. During this time, he drives at 80 mph.

Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours 
Distance = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered during the 4 hours of return trip. 

Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles 
Total distance = 135 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, we subtract the total distance covered during the return trip from the initial distance to find the distance from home.

Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles 
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Eliza worked 45 hours this week. The first 40 hours are considered regular hours, and the remaining 5 hours are considered overtime hours.

For the regular hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. So, her earnings for the regular hours are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

However, in the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate the number of downloads in the third month, we need to find 70% of the second month's downloads (since 100% - 30% = 70%). This is 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads.

Now, we can add the number of downloads in each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree, and then compare it to the total revenue generated by selling the lemons.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, Carlos will earn $1.5 per lemon, and the tree will grow 7 lemons, resulting in a total revenue of $1.5 * 7 = $10.5 per year. However, he will also incur a cost of $3 per year to water and feed the tree, resulting in a net revenue of $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. We can calculate the number of years it will take to break even by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue per year:

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

However, this is the number of years it will take to break even, not to start earning money. Since Carlos will start earning money as soon as he sells the lemons, we need to consider the revenue generated in the first year. In the first year, Carlos will earn $10.5 from selling the lemons, but he will also incur a cost of $3 to water and feed the tree, and the initial cost of $90 to plant the tree. So, in the first year, he will be at a loss of $90 + $3 - $10.5 = $82.5.

In the second year, he will earn $10.5 and incur a cost of $3, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5. This will reduce his total loss to $82.5 - $7.5 = $75. In the third year, he will again earn $10.5 and incur a cost of $3, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5. This will reduce his total loss to $75 - $7.5 = $67.5.

We can see that Carlos's loss will decrease by $7.5 each year. To find the number of years it will take for him to start earning money, we can divide his total loss after the first year ($82.5) by the net revenue per year ($7.5), and then add 1 (since he will start earning money in the year after he breaks even):

$82.5 / $7.5 = 11 years

Since Carlos will start earning money in the year after he breaks even, we add 1 to the result:

11 + 1 = 12, but he will start earning money in the 12th year, so the answer is the year before he breaks even plus 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. Then she sold 2 more to the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at this point is x/3 + 2.

The remaining vacuum cleaners after the green and red houses are x - (x/3 + 2). This simplifies to (2x/3) - 2.

Melanie then sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold ((2x/3) - 2)/2, which simplifies to (x/3) - 1.

Now, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of those sold at the green house, the red house, and the orange house: x/3 + 2 + (x/3 - 1). This simplifies to (2x/3) + 1.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the number of vacuum cleaners sold is x - 5. Setting the two expressions for the number of vacuum cleaners sold equal to each other, we get:

(2x/3) + 1 = x - 5

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 3 = 3x - 15

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

3 = x - 15

Adding 15 to both sides:

18 = x

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the optimal choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit from each option. 

For the jewelry worth $5,000, a 2.5% increase would result in a profit of $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, a 1.2% increase would result in a profit of $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Comparing the two options, the jewelry provides a higher profit. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To determine the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the distances traveled in both directions. 

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Since the directions are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled on both days. So, we add the distance traveled westward (80 miles) to the distance traveled northward (150 miles).

Total distance = Distance westward + Distance northward
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

The total time available is the total distance divided by the desired average speed: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. This means she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance (3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour).

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed needed to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters. However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so we need to subtract 1/3 liter of water (since 1 liter is 1/10 of 10 liters, and 1/10 * 2/3 = 1/15, but for simplicity, we can calculate 1/3 from 2/3 * 1). The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is 20/3 - 1/3 = 19/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 19/3 + 9 = (19 + 27)/3 = 46/3 liters.

46/3 = 15.33 liters"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to establish Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at the time of his son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of these items: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we subtract the cost of the known items from the total to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110. Therefore, the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins is equal to 110. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his Lego sets and then compare it to the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then spent $20 each on 8 video games, for a total of 8 * 20 = $160.

After spending $160 on video games, he had $5 left. This means that the total amount of money he had initially was $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

However, we calculated earlier that he made $195 from selling his Lego sets. Since he only had $165, this means he must have spent the remaining $30 on something else or kept some Lego sets for himself.

Since $30 is the cost of 2 Lego sets ($15 * 2), we can conclude that John did not sell 2 of his Lego sets.

Therefore, the number of Lego sets John still has is 2.

3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's walking and running speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

One-third of six hours is 2 hours, and two-thirds of six hours is 4 hours. 

In 2 hours, Dana can travel 2 * 6 = 12 miles running. 

In 4 hours, Dana can travel 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles walking.

Therefore, in six hours, Dana can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first determine the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame range.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so we multiply 400 by 3 to get the new distance: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame range (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find out how far outside of the flames she can stand: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we multiply the weight per serving by 0.8.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, and he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to consider the total number of Post-it notes she had initially, the number she used, and the number she had remaining.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes, but the exact number is unknown. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'.

At work, Candice used 220 Post-it notes. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had (initial + purchased) minus the number she used should be equal to the number she had remaining.

We can set up the equation as follows:

80 (initial) + x (purchased) - 220 (used) = 23 (remaining)

Combine like terms:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplify the equation:

-140 + x = 23

Add 140 to both sides:

x = 163

The final answer: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. We can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can find the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

We are also given that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * Cost of a blue tie
Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * $40
Cost of a red tie = $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to determine the total number of units in the building and then calculate 3/4 of that number to find the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Occupied units = (3/4) * 120
Occupied units = 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total number of units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then find out how much he makes from selling those eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens, as Lloyd sells them by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Finally, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Uriah removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. The total weight removed by the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, earning 6 * $60 = $360. The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each, earning 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, earning 12 * $40 = $480. Since no truck tires were repaired, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, we see that the mechanic earned more on Thursday ($520) than on Friday ($480). To find the difference, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the charges into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena was charged the initial amount of $140 per month. So, the total amount for the first half of the year is:
6 months * $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena was charged 10% less than the initial amount. To calculate the reduced amount, we need to find 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, we know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank. This means that the 4 gallons of gas she added to her tank were used to travel the 100 miles. We can calculate her car's mpg as follows:

mpg = miles / gallons
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to determine how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas:

Total miles = mpg * total gallons
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons

It is given that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore:
Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we can calculate the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of stickers he has at each step.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from the store, so now he has:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (new stickers) = 31 stickers

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has:
31 (previous stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has:
54 (previous stickers) - 9 (stickers given away) = 45 stickers

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has:
45 (previous stickers) - 28 (stickers used) = 17 stickers

"To find their combined weights, we first need to determine Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = (4 * Grace's weight) - 2
Alex's weight = (4 * 125) - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding Grace's weight and Alex's weight:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) equals 22.

However, we are not given any information about the number of games they drew. For simplicity, let's assume they did not draw any games, so the total number of games is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost.

We are also given that they won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as W = L + 8.

Since the total number of games is 22, we can write the equation as W + L = 22.

Substituting W = L + 8 into the equation W + L = 22, we get (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by using the equation W = L + 8.

W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, and he has one shirt from each vacation, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and then add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times. 
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her annual salary after the 10% increase, which she will receive at the end of each year for the next three years.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600, so her initial annual salary is $600 * 12 = $7,200.

After the first year, she will receive a 10% increase, which is $7,200 * 0.10 = $720. Her new annual salary will be $7,200 + $720 = $7,920.

After the second year, she will receive another 10% increase, which is $7,920 * 0.10 = $792. Her new annual salary will be $7,920 + $792 = $8,712.

After the third year, she will receive another 10% increase, which is $8,712 * 0.10 = $871.20. Her new annual salary will be $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20.

"To determine the number of gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Expected attendees = Total invited guests * (1 - 1/4)
Expected attendees = 16 * (1 - 1/4)
Expected attendees = 16 * (3/4)
Expected attendees = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Expected attendees * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
Total cost = 9 * 2
Total cost = 18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we must first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will consume. 

Adult dinosaurs will eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount the adults will eat to the amount the children will eat: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the age relationships between the siblings. 

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can calculate Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Since Lee runs two seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up the equation: 
G - 2 = 38

Solving for G, we get:
G = 38 + 2
G = 40

So Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles was 40 seconds. 

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his new diet. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is:
(10/100) * 40 = 4 seconds

Now, subtracting 4 seconds from his original time:
40 - 4 = 36

Therefore, Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles, with his improved diet, is 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into its components. We are given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog. This means the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. This means the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, 3/5 of the students are girls. 

Total number of students = 200
Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of sauce to determine the number of tomatoes used. 

Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of the tomatoes must be double the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the initial volume of the tomatoes is 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces.

We know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find the number of cans used, we divide the initial volume of the tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces). 

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. However, 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam, so they didn't drive through it. This leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars that actually drove through the traffic jam.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. Since the total number of cars that drove through the jam is 25, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes can be found by subtracting the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance the fog bank covers in a given time period, and then multiply by the time it takes to cover that distance.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cover 1 mile, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 miles:

10 minutes / 3 miles = 10/3 minutes per mile

Now, we can multiply this rate by the total distance across the city (42 miles) to find the total time:

(10/3 minutes per mile) * 42 miles = (10 * 42) / 3 minutes

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:

So, excluding Wednesday, Frankie watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of TV on Wednesday.

"To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the initial cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The initial cost of the gas is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased. In this case, the price per gallon is $3.00, and the number of gallons purchased is 10.

Initial cost = price per gallon * number of gallons
Initial cost = $3.00 * 10
Initial cost = $30.00

The cashback amount is the cashback per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased. In this case, the cashback per gallon is $0.20, and the number of gallons purchased is 10.

Cashback amount = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Cashback amount = $0.20 * 10
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the initial cost to get the final cost of the gas.

Final cost = initial cost - cashback amount
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then find out how much water the boat took on for that distance.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can calculate the distance she rows per second and then multiply it by the total time it took her to reach the shore.

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second
Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Total distance = 1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply it by 2.

Total amount of water = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 16 liters

Then, 6x = 1800
Divide both sides by 6:
x = 1800 / 6
x = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let y be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Then, we can set up another equation:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber. Sasha bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 at $10 each, so the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 at $16 each, so the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards will be $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards will be $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price. Sasha sells 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 at $15 each, so the total selling price for these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also sells 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 at $24 each, so the total selling price for these boards is 5 * $24 = $120. The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. We also know that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x. Then, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as x + 30% of x, which is equal to $40,000.

x + 0.3x = 40000
1.3x = 40000
x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769 (approximately)

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.

Now, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we can calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 0.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 16000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume that her salary also increased by some percentage. However, the problem does not provide the exact percentage increase for Lylah. But we can infer that the problem intends for their salaries to increase proportionally, as it does not provide any information to the contrary. Given that Adrien's salary increased by 40%, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 0.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 12307
Lylah's new salary = 43076

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43076
Total salary = 99076

"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of fruits each person brought: 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael) = 27.

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern for each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours per day. So, for these two days, she slept 6 * 2 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day. Since there are 4 days in this period, she slept 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

Jennie starts with 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is now 30. 

To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = 30 - 20 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

After Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, she had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially (x + 5) minus the 3 spoons she used should be equal to 12. 

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages he purchased and then add it to the number of chicken sausages.

Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding the number of friends each of them made:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he is purchasing.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

We are also told that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To determine the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the patients and subtract the total cost of the doctors' services.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The hospital charges the patients $200/hour, so the total revenue is: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The doctors charge the hospital $150/hour, so the total cost is: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, Pam and Fred took 4 + 6 = 10 rides. 
Since each ride cost 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:

Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * miles walked on Monday
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * 4
Miles walked on Tuesday = 24

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Total mileage = miles walked on Monday + miles walked on Tuesday + miles walked on Wednesday
41 = 4 + 24 + miles walked on Wednesday
41 = 28 + miles walked on Wednesday
miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28

3 times the number of video games Brian has = 3 * 25 = 75
5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has = 75 - 5 = 70

Therefore, Bobby has 70 video games.

The cost of the bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
The cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. 
20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to get the final total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. The total number of questions he was able to complete in the first test is 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate. The total number of questions he was able to complete in the second test is 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Mark left incomplete in each test. For the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete. For the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

The total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 35 + 70 = 105.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning, which is reminiscent of the philosophical concept of logical reasoning as discussed by philosophers such as Aristotle and René Descartes.

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12.

The problem also states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

Substituting B = 12 into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of bees is 700 (Q + B + W = 700).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees (W = 2B).
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens (B = 2Q).

We can use the third equation to express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute B in the second equation to express W in terms of Q: W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now, we can substitute B and W in the first equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, and W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after 12 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still outside the hive.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, the total number of bees outside the hive is 15 (from the first 12 hours) + 60 (from the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

However, we are asked about the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. According to the problem, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the end. 

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. So, before the ants took the fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries left.

A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole (2/3)x fries, and (1/3)x fries remained. We know that (1/3)x = 6. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 3: x = 6 * 3 = 18. So, there were 18 fries before the raccoon stole some.

Before the raccoon, three pigeons ate three fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Before the pigeons, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 

So, before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

This is the number of fries that were in the pack when the seagull stole it from Dave. Since Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack, the original number of fries in the pack was 34 + 14 = 48.

"To determine the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

We are given that one red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5. Since there are 3 action figures, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add the cost of all the toys together: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is 15 * 3 = 45.

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session to find out how many times she needs to babysit. 

45 / 9 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's current age using the relationship S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho walks 20 miles a day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he walks a total of 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Pancho walks 10 miles a day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he walks a total of 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

Now, we can add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to find the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum payments per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payments and add it to the total minimum payments.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total payments per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

"To determine the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

The time it takes to peel a potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time it takes to cut it is 5 seconds. To make the units consistent, we can convert the 5 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). 

5 seconds / 60 = 1/12 minutes (or approximately 0.083 minutes)

Now, we can add the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:

1.5 minutes (peeling) + 0.083 minutes (cutting) = 1.583 minutes per potato

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, we can multiply the time per potato by the total number of potatoes:

1.583 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes

Their total revenue is $25 (profit) plus their total cost. Since we don't know the total cost yet, let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. 

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x. 

The revenue from 'x' gallons is 20x glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10x.

Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation: 
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5 gallons

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can calculate how much they spent on lemons:

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is:

The first runner runs in 60 seconds. 
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. 
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. 
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the well-rounded team from the total time of the less well-rounded team.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll:

P(even, even) = P(even) × P(even) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

Now, we can calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

ΔP = P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

ΔP (%) = 0.25 × 100 = 25%

We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total amount of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling 'x' bags is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount he earns from both publishers. 

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences. So, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

We also know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he collects and then multiply that by the number of liters per pail.

Baldur collects 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so the total number of pails per day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters per pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John would have made without the raise:
2000 * 52 weeks = 104,000

With the 5% raise, John's new weekly salary is:
2000 + (2000 * 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100

The total amount of money John made with the raise is:
2100 * 52 weeks = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000, we get:
109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

"To determine the total number of barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced and then convert that to barrels.

First, we calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year by multiplying the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Next, we convert the total tons of grapes to barrels by multiplying the tons by the number of barrels per ton: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week. Since he used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

He also used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the number of green and yellow pens she already had.

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she initially had 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens to the number of green and yellow pens: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98.

The total number of pens Janet has now is 98."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to determine the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are six tests and she can remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of the five highest scores.

The desired average is 93, and there will be five scores included in the average. So, the total score she needs is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score of her first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since she can remove the lowest score (71), we subtract it from the total: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the score she needs on the sixth test (x) to 367 and set it equal to the total score she needs (465): 367 + x = 465.

Solving for x, we get x = 465 - 367 = 98.

"To determine the total kilometers Michael rode, we need to break down his riding into two phases and calculate the total distance for each phase.

In the first phase, Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering 25 kilometers each time. Since he rode at least 5 times a week, we will use 5 times a week for our calculation. 

Distance covered in the first phase = 5 times/week * 25 kilometers/time * 4 weeks
Distance covered in the first phase = 5 * 25 * 4
Distance covered in the first phase = 500 kilometers

In the second phase, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering 60 kilometers each time.

Distance covered in the second phase = 2 times/week * 60 kilometers/time * 3 weeks
Distance covered in the second phase = 2 * 60 * 3
Distance covered in the second phase = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first phase + Distance covered in the second phase
Total distance covered = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers
Total distance covered = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 12 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 6 plates. If each plate costs $6000, then the total cost of half a dozen plates would be 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups would be $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the amount of water in the small pool is 'x - 16', and the amount of water in the big pool is '2x - 16'. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x' (the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago), we can find the current amount of water in the small pool by subtracting the lost water:

Current amount of water in the small pool = x - 16
= 24 - 16

The principal amount is $2000, and the additional 10% interest is $2000 * 0.10 = $200. So, the total amount Janeth owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's age.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age can be calculated as follows:

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, we know that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet:

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

In three years, their ages will be:

Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45

To calculate the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:

Next, we need to calculate the tax. Mark pays 10% tax on the cars, which is 10% of $240,000. To calculate this, we multiply $240,000 by 0.10, which equals $24,000.

Now, we add the tax to the initial cost of the cars: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Finally, we need to account for the registration cost. Mark pays $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total registration cost is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Adding the registration cost to the total cost after taxes, we get $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The remaining students after exit A is:
1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, which is:
3/5 * 700 = 420 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after exits A and B:
700 - 420 = 280 students

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

where x is the number of candies Robert has. Solving for x, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has:

27 + 6 = 33

candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

54 - 33 = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of books and the number of times each book is read.

Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book, making a total of 3 books. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, making a total of 3 books read by Dolly. 

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, making a total of 3 books read by Pandora.

Since each book is read twice (once by its owner and once by the other person), the total number of times a book is read is 2 times the total number of books, which is 2 * 3 = 6.

However, the question asks for the total number of books read, not the total number of times a book is read. Since each person reads 3 books, and there are 2 people, the total number of books read is still 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. This means Mike writes 2 letters per week per pen pal, for a total of 2 * 3 = 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly limit.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason has used for his daily calls with his boss. Since this month has 30 days, and each call is 15 minutes, the total minutes used for these calls is 30 * 15 = 450 minutes.

In addition to these calls, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. So, the total minutes he has used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's monthly limit of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

7 + x = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 27 - 7
x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. The difference is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The problem states that the difference in snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first determine the total hours of makeup work done. 

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. 
Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. This can be done by adding up the individual costs.

Total cost = cost of cake ingredients + cost of birthday presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To determine the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. 

Given that the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 60 * 0.5 = 30. 

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27. 

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of animals killed last night and the number of animals killed today.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's call the number of cougars killed today 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We are also told that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now we can set up an equation: x = 12. Since x represents the number of cougars killed today, we know that the number of wolves killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36.

The total number of animals killed today is 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.

The total number of animals killed is the sum of the animals killed last night and today: 25 + 48 = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. This implies that the 40 cows are divided into 20 stalls, so each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Initially, 8 of the stalls had 8 * 20 = 160 cows. After Mr. Sylas adds 2 cows to each stall, the total number of cows in 8 stalls becomes 160 + (8 * 2) = 160 + 16 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate its total weight before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the 200-foot tree by dividing 200 by 10 and multiplying by 400. 

200 / 10 = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds to determine how much weight was lost due to the termites. 

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

To find the current weight of the tree, we subtract the weight lost from the original weight.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of apples and bananas each person has.

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and we know Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 52

Solving for x, we get:
x = 52 - 8
x = 44

So Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, the number of bananas Jamal has is:
44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:
48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea's fruits: 52 (apples) + 24 (bananas) = 76
Jamal's fruits: 44 (apples) + 48 (bananas) = 92

Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we must first calculate the number of dozens of cookies she is making. Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12.

Today, Carla is making 36 cookies, which is 36 / 12 = 3 dozen cookies. 
Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, which is 30 / 12 = 2.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we can multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for each day. 
For today, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour. 
For tomorrow, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

The selling price of the house is $400,000. 

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

We also know that Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, we can calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Transfer fees - Brokerage fee - Remaining loan amount
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and then 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, we need to find the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken. This is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken. So, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"A simple yet intriguing question that allows us to ponder the nature of time and its effects on human existence. From a philosophical perspective, we can view this question as an exploration of the concept of change and the passage of time.

In this case, we are given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20. This is a static snapshot of their current state. However, as time progresses, their ages will change, and we are asked to consider the sum of their ages in 10 years.

From a logical and mathematical perspective, we can approach this problem by recognizing that the sum of their ages will increase by 10 + 10 = 20, since both Mico and Marco will have aged 10 years.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum (20) plus the additional 20 years, resulting in a total of 40.

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To determine the total number of people that need to be served, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people is 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost is 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to determine the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the first and second weeks, and then add those numbers together.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Therefore, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of stories in the first and second weeks to find the overall total: 120 + 240 = 360.

"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to establish his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18

Now, to find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has and then subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.
So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will be left with 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we must first calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. 

The weight of one flagstone is 75 pounds. 
The total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

Since each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of one truck
= 6000 / 2000
= 3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks would not be enough to carry the remaining weight, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 4 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, but 3 trucks can carry 60 flagstones (3 * 2000 = 6000, 6000 / 75 = 80), so we need 4 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip,

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. The distance is 480 miles, and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour.

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Now, we can find the total number of medals they have together by adding their individual medals: 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we need to calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars the adults will receive is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to determine how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working on the task. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes worked by 10: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15.

Since Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 * $5 = $75.

"To determine the total points of the three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to calculate their points after the third round. 

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, we need to distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed:
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of the three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To determine the number of oranges left unwashed, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by Will's sons. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed is the sum of the ages of the two sons, which is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises he did on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total exercises from both days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine how many weeks it will last: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

"To determine the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total number of bids and the corresponding amount.

The opening bid is $200. Three other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. So, the sequence of bids is as follows:

1. Opening bid: $200
2. Person 1 bids: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Person 2 bids: $300 + $50 = $350
5. Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400
6. Person 3 bids: $400 + $50 = $450
7. Carmen bids: $450 + $50 = $500

Since Carmen wins the auction after the last bid, the desk costs her $500.

"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John's work is 30 miles away, and he goes there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week, so the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The mileage cost is $2 per mile, so the total mileage cost per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost of driving for John per year is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the combined time he exercised on Sunday and Monday. 

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. The combined time is 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined time by 2. 

2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding pattern. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, it creates two pages on each side. This means that each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 4 pages per piece of paper = 8

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 8."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 for rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year by the price of each book, which is 20$. 

Total amount earned in the second year = 65 * 20 = 1300

"To determine Watson's total earnings in April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April. 

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours. 
He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from hours worked is 50 * $10 = $500. 
Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. 
So, his total weekly earnings is $500 + $300 = $800.

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings in April is $800 * 4 = $3200.

"To determine the number of people John lost to, we need to find the percentage of people he lost to, which is the remaining percentage after subtracting the percentage he won from 100%. 

John won 80% of the arm-wrestling matches, so he lost 100% - 80% = 20% of the matches.

Now, we need to find 20% of the total number of people he arm-wrestled, which is 20. 

20% of 20 is (20/100) * 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4.

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we can calculate this as follows:

Total loaves = 60
Loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60 = 40

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This can be calculated as:

Loaves left = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning
Loaves left = 60 - 40 = 20

It is given that half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon. This can be calculated as:

Loaves sold in the afternoon = (1/2) * Loaves left
Loaves sold in the afternoon = (1/2) * 20
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks to find the weight loss per week.

Weight loss per week for Joey = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find the total number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds), we can divide the total weight loss by the weight loss per 4 weeks for Sandy.

Weight loss per 4 weeks for Sandy = 2 pounds
Total weight loss = 8 pounds
Number of 4-week periods for Sandy = Total weight loss / Weight loss per 4 weeks for Sandy
Number of 4-week periods for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds
Number of 4-week periods for Sandy = 4

Since each period is 4 weeks, we can multiply the number of periods by the number of weeks per period to find the total number of weeks.

Total number of weeks for Sandy = Number of 4-week periods for Sandy * Number of weeks per period
Total number of weeks for Sandy = 4 * 4
Total number of weeks for Sandy = 16

"To calculate the total savings, we need to determine the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, we add the total savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the overall savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract them from his initial budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, we calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

We can now calculate Theo's total expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo's initial budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. So, the amount he has available to spend is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, we subtract his total expenses from the amount he has available to spend: $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by them is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat two eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by them is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

- 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people due to previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he has and then multiply it by the weight of each marble.

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles he has now is 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L × W × H = 6 × 4 × 5 = 120 cubic feet

"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as follows:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

It is also given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as follows:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of children in the classroom by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = x (poles) / 45 (wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:
1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:

"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils they each have. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. 

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. Since Jam has 2 loose pencils, we subtract those from her total to find the number of pencils in the boxes. 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes. 

Since Jam has 3 boxes, we divide the number of pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold. 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the added cream:

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

However, this is incorrect as the 60 would include non-programmers. We need to find the total number of programmers first. 

Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is (2/5)x and the number of senior programmers is x - (2/5)x = (3/5)x.

We know that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40. So, (2/5)x = 40.

x = 40 * (5/2)
x = 100

So, the total number of programmers is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40, and the number of senior programmers is 60.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, which is $2400 per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000
Total amount paid to junior programmers = $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400
Total amount paid to senior programmers = $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000
Total amount paid to all programmers = $224,000

"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

For Job B, the total income is $42,000/year. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before income tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, the total tax paid is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year.

Since Job B has a higher net income ($32,400) compared to Job A ($24,000), we need to calculate the difference in net income. The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price is 75% of the previous price, or 0.75 * $12 = $9 per share. The total value after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

Final answer: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of hot dogs each person ate. 

First, we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. 

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group can be represented as 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. Therefore, the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. We can set up the following equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know 'x' is 70, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from 'x':

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows on the farm. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as 'ch'. We are given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can express this relationship as:

ch = 2c

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

ch + c = 60

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

2c + c = 60
3c = 60
c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

ch = 2c
ch = 2(20)
ch = 40

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens on the farm.

To find the total number of legs, we need to know that cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To determine the number of balls Josh starts to juggle on stage, we need to calculate the total number of balls he had before dropping any. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has at the end of the fourth week is 3 + 4 = 7.

When Josh drops 3 balls, 2 are caught by the crowd, and 1 is lost. Therefore, he is left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each animal based on the given information. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he runs after taking his coach's advice. 

Since his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, we calculate the additional distance as 1/5 of 5000 meters. 
1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters

Now, we add this additional distance to his original daily distance to get the new daily distance.
New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to get the total distance covered in June.
Total distance = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies per day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, Jenny eats the remaining cookies, which is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies per week.

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we first need to calculate the daily earnings when the factory made tractors and when it made silos.

When the factory made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor. So, their daily earnings were:
10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So, their daily earnings are:
5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and divide it by the original daily earnings, then multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = ((New earnings - Old earnings) / Old earnings) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to determine the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours. However, this is only 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. 

To find the total time he spent on vacation, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total miles between services by the miles traveled per day: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

Average amount of stuffing = 10 / 2 
Average amount of stuffing = 5 pounds 

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Total amount of stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 
Total amount of stuffing for chihuahua beds = 8 pounds

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

Now, we subtract the total number of socks Lindsay washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks.

"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the total number of cookies she initially had and the number of cookies her brother ate.

First, we calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had: 
She bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. 
Total cookies = 23 (bought) + 42 (given) = 65 cookies.

Then, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies:
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

"To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate per time period, and t is the time period.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.1 per year, and the time period (t) is 5 months or 5/12 years, we can calculate the interest as follows:

I = 3650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
I ≈ 3650 * 0.1 * 0.4167 
I ≈ 152.08

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = 3650 + 152.08
Total Amount ≈ 3802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / 5
Monthly Payment ≈ 3802.08 / 5
Monthly Payment ≈ 760.42

"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so the total distance Cho hiked is:
14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so the total distance Chloe hiked is:
9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, let's find the difference in the distances they hiked:
112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is 130 (Axel's pesos) + 220 (Anna's pesos) = 350 pesos.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate her total revenue and total cost. 

Millie buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18, which she spent on supplies.

Her total profit is her total revenue minus her total cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she is open: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

"To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to first determine the number of female choir members. Since the choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls, the number of female members is 52 * 0.5 = 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it due to the bus breakdown. So, the number of female members who can perform is 26 * 0.5 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, adding to the total number of performers. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions, which is reminiscent of the philosophical idea of proportionality in the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves, we first need to determine the total cost of his new streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is 2 * $10 * 0.8 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Tim saves by subtracting the cost of his new streaming services from the cost of his old cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spent 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, then subtract the cards she passed out, and finally add the cards she received.

Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30. 

The total number of cards Erica initially had is 20 (her own cards) + 30 (pre-made cards) = 50.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the total number of cards she initially had: 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, we add the cards she received from family and friends: 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices. 

Jenny also gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark. 

Now, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

Jenny then eats 2 slices, so we subtract those from the remaining slices: 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save money, we must first calculate the total amount he still needs to save for the bike. This can be done by subtracting the amount he already has from the cost of the bike.

Cost of bike: $300
Amount Mark already has: $50
Amount Mark still needs: $300 - $50 = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save by dividing the amount he still needs by his daily earnings.

Amount Mark still needs: $250
Daily earnings: $10
Number of days: $250 / $10 = 25

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs separately.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders.

Next, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3rd the number of spiders. 
Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90 = 30.

Now, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48.

Finally, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to get the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to establish the ages of Alice and Beth in relation to Erica's age.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5 years
Beth's age = 30 years + 5 years
Beth's age = 35 years

Now, since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7 years
Alice's age = 35 years + 7 years
Alice's age = 42 years

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica can be calculated as follows:

Age difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Age difference = 42 years - 30 years

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

So, the total amount of flour required is 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

The total amount of milk required is 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4.

"To determine the amount of energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage rate, and then at the reduced usage rate.

The original usage rate is 900 watts for 8 hours a day. 
First, we convert watts to kilowatts: 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).
The original daily energy usage is 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.
The original 30-day energy usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh.

The reduced usage rate is 900 watts for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
The reduced daily energy usage is 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh per day.
The reduced 30-day energy usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh.

The energy saved in 30 days is the difference between the original and reduced 30-day energy usage: 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the weight of each ingredient by its respective cost:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Then, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis he has now is 40 + 60 = 100.

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the new corns to the initial amount of corns: 80 + 20 = 100 corns.

Finally, we combine the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house: 100 corns + 100 cannolis = 200.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He then took another 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which means before the jog, he had 2,000 + 2,000 = 4,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Since he had 4,000 steps left before the jog and had already taken 6,000 steps, the number of steps he took during the jog can be calculated by subtracting the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog plus the steps left after the jog. However, we can also calculate it by subtracting the steps taken before the jog from the total steps minus the steps left after the jog.

10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken before and during the jog. 
8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total hours worked by all employees in May is 160 hours/employee * 40 employees = 6400 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in May is 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees remaining is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total hours worked by each employee in June is still 160 hours. The total hours worked by all employees in June is 160 hours/employee * 30 employees = 4800 hours. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the initial $10 given by her parents.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since it's ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" the cost of 2 pounds would be $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (half off the original price of $3). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Since each magnet costs $0.25, the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the purchases: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection of two events: the candles that smell like wet dog and the candles that explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, and we don't know what percentage of the total candles are more dangerous, we need to find the number of more dangerous candles first. 

Since 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode, we can assume that these are the more dangerous candles. So, 1% of 50000 candles are more dangerous, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Now, 5% of these 500 candles smell like wet dog, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

However, we are asked to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since all the candles that smell like wet dog are among the more dangerous candles, and all the more dangerous candles are guaranteed to explode (as they are the 1% that are not guaranteed not to explode), all the candles that smell like wet dog will explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount amount for each blouse is 30% of $20.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discount amount for each blouse is $6. Now, we can calculate the discounted price for each blouse by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price.

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the second equation as:
2c + d = 304

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work our way backward from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount of money he received from the two banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12,000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12,000 + $5000 = $17,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20. 

Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30. 

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining number of cats: (3/5) * 30 = 18. 

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining number of cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

First, let's calculate the cost of the introductory period. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the total cost is 6 * 8 = $48.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the period at the normal rate. This period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill only signed up for 2 years (24 months), and 6 months were at the introductory rate, the remaining months at the normal rate would be 24 - 6 - 10 = 8 months. The total cost is 8 * 12 = $96.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the period at the increased rate. This period is 10 months at $14 per month (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months). The total cost is 10 * 14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs of all three periods to get the total cost of 2 years of the service: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and then find the difference between their original prices.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

The total savings is $6. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, which is $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans originally cost $22 and Cole saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Similarly, since the tattered jeans cost $28 and Cole saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference between the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Kenny spent on the amusement park ticket and the spending cash. The total amount spent is $100 (amusement park ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

Since Kenny sold his Pokémon cards for $1.5 each, we can calculate the total number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount spent ($150) by the price per card ($1.5). However, we know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Then, the number of cards Kenny sold is 2/3 * x. The total amount he earned from selling these cards is $1.5 * (2/3 * x), which is equal to $150.

Now, we can set up the equation:

$1.5 * (2/3 * x) = $150

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(2/3 * x) = $150 / $1.5
(2/3 * x) = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 Pokémon cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who might want two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests who would only want one. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs one hotdog to have a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs, which is 26.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog because of the shortage. Since 54 hotdogs were prepared, 54 / 2 = 27 guests can have two hotdogs, and 40 - 27 = 13 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Now, let's add the costs together: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20): $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Since he spent $1.20 on chips, he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, the total weight of the cake they ate is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width) to find the width. 

360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)) to find the perimeter.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is 90% of Jon's swim time. 
James' swim time = 0.9 * 40 minutes = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
James' bike ride time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots. 

The total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.
The total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the capacity of the farm truck:
Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the farm truck
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there is any remainder. In this case, the division results in a whole number, so no rounding is needed.

"To determine the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles.

Each week, Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans worth 2 cents each, which equals 3 * 2 = 6 cents. She also recycles 5 plastic bottles worth 3 cents each, which equals 5 * 3 = 15 cents. The total amount she earns per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in the month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we first need to determine the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then subtract the 50 cards she kept for herself.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

After keeping 50 cards for herself, she has 350 - 50 = 300 cards left to give to her students.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be calculated by dividing the total number of cards given to students (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10).

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30

"To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of apples for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10. After receiving a 10% discount, Kelly paid $10 - (10% of $10) = $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we can calculate the difference in the amount Kelly paid compared to Becky. Kelly paid $9, and Becky paid $8, so Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $1 more than Becky.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week. 

First, we start with the initial number of shoes: 200.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. Now he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. Now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. Now he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Now he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Since we are asked about the number of shoes he has on Sunday, and there is no information about any changes on Sunday, the number of shoes he has on Sunday is the same as on Saturday.

"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

The pen cost $2. The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. $1 less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.

So, the total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Theo gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there were 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is 30 * 10 = 300 pencils.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used. The remaining pencils are 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation (x/2) + 2 = 5. To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation.

First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long. 

The remoras are 6 inches long each, and there are two of them, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's length) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

"To solve this problem, we can use the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Since Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available to break in the shoes is 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days.

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (12) to find out how long he has to spend walking each day:

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To determine the number of books each child received, we first need to find out the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can find out the number of books each child received by dividing the total number of books by the number of kids.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend, we need to calculate the increased price. 20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. Therefore, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Given that one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation L + B/2 + B = 43, we get (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine the B terms: 2B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine the B terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first determine the total cost of the other two packs of gum. Suzie paid $2 for the pack of grape gum and half as much, or $1, for the pack of green apple gum. The total cost of these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. This means he gets 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6. This means he gets 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option in terms of sticks per dollar. However, the question asks for the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

If Frederick buys the 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can buy 24 / 4 = 6 pieces of wood. Since each piece of wood gives 200 sticks, he can make 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog will need 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 dogs * 2 pairs per dog = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of her daily bus trips is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total weekly cost is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total weekly cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cows at the zoo and the number of sheep at the farm.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion.

Let's start with the onions. Rose bought 12 onions, which is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought. We can set up the equation:

12 = 4x

where x is the number of onions Sophia bought. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, let's consider the potatoes. Rose bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought. We can set up the equation:

4 = 4y

where y is the number of potatoes Sophia bought. To solve for y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So Sophia bought 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can add the number of onions and potatoes:

Total = 3 (onions) + 1 (potato)
Total = 4

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to achieve his goal and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day.
January, February, March, April, May, and June have a total of 181 days (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30).
From July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total number of days = 1 + 181 + 19 = 201 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories/day

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning, which is reminiscent of the method of analysis and synthesis employed by ancient Greek philosophers such as Euclid and Archimedes.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Therefore, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house: 5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours.

Now, if one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take them 240 hours to paint a whole house (since a whole house is twice as large as half a house).

Next, we need to consider the effect of having 5 people painting the house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the 2 monitors. 

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the target by 30 to find the average daily savings required to hit the target. However, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as in the first half.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days, so the first half will have 15 days and the second half will also have 15 days. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total savings:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since Elvis saves twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be 2x = 2(25) = 50.

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the round trip distance for each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

The distance to work is 3 miles, so the round trip distance is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles per day.

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

The alphabet consists of 26 letters. 

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 * 2 = 52 letters
2. She writes half of it once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters (this is what she re-writes)

In total, Elise has written the initial 52 + 13 letters, and then re-written the 65 letters. So, the total number of letters written is: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times larger would be 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this number, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. To do this, we calculate 10% of the total cost before the discount, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two categories: sales up to $1000 and sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission. 
30% of $1000 is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission. 
10% of $1500 is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total amount of money Antonella earned, we add the commission from the first $1000 and the commission from the remaining $1500. 
Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants to have for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 * 24 = 48.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We are given that on a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, and on a warm day, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day.

The time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day is 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim on a hot day, not a warm day. Since we are not given any information about the time it takes Ray to swim on a hot day, we will assume that the time it takes Ray to swim on a hot day is the same as the time it takes him to swim on a warm day, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so he swims 3 miles in 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so he swims 3 miles in 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the daily recommended cups of coffee and then calculate the amount of coffee Octavia and Juan drink.

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, he must reduce his daily coffee intake by 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds). 

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by the number of friends: (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun. 

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so it is also at 32 degrees from the ground initially. 

The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. To find the total movement of the sun, we multiply the rate of movement by the time: 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun is moving upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house, we add the total movement to the initial angle: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 70 pages per 1.5 minutes * 2 pages = 70 pages

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is the sum of the pages she read in the first week and the second week:

Number of days = 7
Daily expenditure = Total money / Number of days = $70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, the number of wooden action figures he bought in these 4 days is:

Number of wooden action figures = Daily expenditure / Cost per wooden action figure * Number of days

"To determine how much money Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayon muffins she can create. 

First, we find the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64 to get 192 crayons.

However, the problem states that the crayons are worn down to small pieces. Assuming each crayon can be broken down into equal small pieces, we need to know how many small pieces each crayon can be broken down into. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information. 

But, we do know that Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. So, we can divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to get the total number of muffin crayons.

Since we do not know the exact number of small pieces per crayon, let's assume each crayon can be broken down into 'x' small pieces. Then, the total number of small pieces is 192 * x.

Now, we divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to get the total number of muffin crayons: (192 * x) / 8 = 24x.

Since Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is 24x * $1.50 = $36x.

However, we still do not know the value of 'x'. But, if we assume that each crayon can be broken down into at least 8 small pieces (a reasonable assumption given that 8 small pieces are needed to make one muffin crayon), then x = 8. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Kate can make: $36 * 8 = $288.

Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage difference = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we can apply this percentage to the required temperature of 520 degrees.

Actual temperature required = 520
Percentage difference = 4%

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. A dozen cups is equal to 12 cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups and dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups, which is 28 more than Judy's 12 cups. Since her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, and Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two. Judy brought 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the two boxes after the discount. 

The original price of one box is $100.00, and with a 10% discount, the price becomes:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since he buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they are both paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30, and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories she burns during her workout. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the amount of water she needs by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

The amount of water she needs is (1600 / 200) * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to first determine his final typing speed after the second increase. 

Initially, Jared's typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. Then, after the second increase of 5 WPM, his typing speed becomes 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add these measurements and divide by the total number of measurements.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3

"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose a total of 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain a total of 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained from eating donuts and the weight lost from eating Cheerios. This is 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we must consider the number of people she invited, the number of people they invited, and the number of people she invited via phone call, including their spouses.

First, Alex invited 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people invited 2 friends, resulting in 100 * 2 = 200 additional guests. So, the total number of guests from email invitations is 100 (initial guests) + 200 (additional guests) = 300.

Next, Alex called 10 of her friends, and 8 of them said they would bring their spouses. This means 8 of the 10 friends will bring an additional person, resulting in 8 additional guests. So, the total number of guests from phone calls is 10 (initial guests) + 8 (spouses) = 18.

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats Alex will need by adding the total number of guests from email invitations and phone calls: 300 (email guests) + 18 (phone call guests) = 318.

"To determine the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

Amazon cost = boots cost + shipping cost
Amazon cost = $16 + $4
Amazon cost = $20

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as it is on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

eBay cost = boots cost + shipping cost
eBay cost = $13 + $8
eBay cost = $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay.

Difference in cost = eBay cost - Amazon cost
Difference in cost = $21 - $20
Difference in cost = $1

Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

On the fourth day, the beanstalk's height (32 feet) exceeds the height of Mark's window (20 feet). Therefore, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily, we first need to establish the protein content per gram of mushrooms. Given that a 100-gram cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram as follows:

Protein per gram = 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms daily, we can calculate his daily protein intake from mushrooms as follows:

Daily protein intake = 200 grams * 0.03 grams of protein per gram = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply his daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

Weekly protein intake = 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
Adding the extra cost for the porcelain crown, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning and the properties of triangles. Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Since 90 degrees is the largest angle, our answer is:

"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the value of each coin into cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 1 nickel = 5 cents
- 1 penny = 1 cent

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Adding the total amount of money Colby has: 
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, which is 1 * 12 = 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. The total number of games Steve has after the first year is 5 (initial games) + 17 (games from the first year) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, which is 2 * 12 = 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. The total number of games Steve has after the second year is 22 (games from the first year) + 29 (games from the second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, which is 4 * 12 = 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. The total number of games Steve has after the third year is 51 (games from the first two years) + 53 (games from the third year) = 104 games.

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we first need to calculate the total number of rotations per month and then the total number of rotations per year.

Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles per month = 145,000 rotations per month

To calculate the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations per month * 12 months per year = 1,740,000 rotations per year

Now, we can calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced by dividing the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months were funded at $100,000, so the cost for this phase is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as initially planned, the total duration is 5 months (initial) + 45 months (additional) = 50 months.

The additional months required 50% more funding per month than the initial months. Since the initial funding was $100,000 for 5 months, the monthly funding for the initial phase was $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

The additional months required 50% more funding per month, so the monthly funding for the additional months was $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total cost for the additional 45 months is $30,000 per month * 45 months = $1,350,000.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a series of conversions. 

First, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second, we divide 20 kb by 1000.

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Next, we need to convert the time unit from seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we multiply Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour.

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining days.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

In the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week: 30 + 24 = 54.

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between that height and Adam's current height.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To determine James' commission, we first need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the acquisition cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first determine the total number of riders who can stay upright, and then find the percentage of men among them.

Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Now, we are told that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 riders = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

Number of men = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women
= 25 - 15
= 10

Number of men who can stay upright on the wave: 10"
"To find the total price of the three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of the three jewels by adding their individual prices.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps in addition to the given number of snowflake stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed, which is a fundamental concept in physics and mathematics, but also has implications in philosophical discussions of time, space, and motion, as seen in the works of philosophers such as Henri Bergson and Immanuel Kant.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed to get the relative speed: 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed. The distance is the initial distance between Bob and Tom, which is 75 miles.

Plugging in the values, we get: time = 75 miles / 15 mph.

time = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of fish caught by each person. 

Let's start with Naomi, who caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from Naomi's total:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's total, we add 3 to Darren's catch:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total cost / Number of classes attended ≤ $10

Since there are 10 total classes, let's say Manny attends x classes. Then, the equation becomes:

$60 / x ≤ $10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend, we can rearrange the equation to solve for x:

x ≥ $60 / $10
x ≥ 6

This means Manny can attend at most 6 classes while keeping the cost per class below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss:

10 - 6 = 4

classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to establish their individual daily production rates. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers daily, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production rate is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

Now, we can calculate their combined daily production rate: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply their combined daily production rate by 7 (the number of days in a week): 150 * 7 = 1050.

We are also told that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. 
The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The volume of the hole can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the time it takes Bob to shovel a cubic foot of earth:

Time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats cost one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his original salary and add it to his original salary.

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000.

So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to his new monthly salary, Tim also receives a bonus worth half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

However, this bonus is only given once, so we need to calculate his total yearly income by multiplying his new monthly salary by 12 and then adding the bonus.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is:
$750 / 5 = $150 per pair
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is:

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 30% of the 20% of employees who are management.

First, we find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Then, we find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days Christina had in the first 30 days. We know that her first eight days were good, and then she had 12 good days in total. Since the first eight days were good, the remaining good days must be 12 - 8 = 4.

However, we are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that two of the remaining good days occurred in these three days. 

So, the number of good days left in the month would be the total good days minus the good days in the first 30 days minus the good days in the next three days. But since we are only interested in the good days left in the month, we only need to subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days in the month. Since the month has 30 days and we are given the moods for the first 30 days and the next three days, we can assume that the month has 33 days. However, we are only interested in the good days left in the month, which is the same as the good days left in the 30 days. 

The good days left in the 30 days would be 12 - 8 - 2 = 2."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3. Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between the desired height and the initial height. 

First, let's convert the initial height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply the initial height in feet by 12 to get the initial height in inches.

Initial height in inches = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, let's calculate the difference between the desired height and the initial height.

Difference in height = Desired height - Initial height
= 600 inches - 240 inches
= 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference in height by the growth rate to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach the desired height.

Number of days = Difference in height / Growth rate
= 360 inches / 30 inches/day
= 12 days

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs arrive, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, when James returns after buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs has doubled from 12 to 24. So, James needs 24 toys now.

Finally, when James returns again, 3 dogs are gone, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. To find the number of signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total number of signatures they currently have from their goal.

100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to establish her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we multiply Karen's hourly wage by the total hours she works in two days to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the number of potatoes and the number of hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato by dividing the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes. 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Now, we can use this ratio to calculate the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. 

96 potatoes * 6 hash browns per potato = 576 hash browns.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has: 
Katarina has 68 cookies
Max has 73 cookies
The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies
Summer has 96 cookies

Total number of cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20. 

We are given that the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took Chris to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes to mow the lawn in turtle mode to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes.

Now, we know that mowing the entire lawn in turtle mode takes 60 minutes, so mowing half the lawn in turtle mode will take half of that time: 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Mowing the entire lawn in rabbit mode takes 40 minutes, so mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode will take half of that time: 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we add the time it took to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode: 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. Therefore, the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t.

Given that their combined ages are 44, we can set up the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins by substituting t into the equation T = t + 7: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, we can subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies, so to find the cost of one candy, we divide by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00, and 10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over a period of 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. Over 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. Over 10 years, Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved is the sum of Rong's and Neil's savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the vet visit. We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we also know the cost of the vaccines, which is $20 each, and John's dog needs 2 of them. So, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines will be 40% of the total bill. We can set up the equation: 0.4x = $40. 

Solving for x, we get x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

Now, we know the total bill is $100, and the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has. We are given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. 

So, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

As for regular chairs, she needs 42, but she already has 40. So, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the problem doesn't specify the proportion of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, we'll assume the factory can switch between the two flavors. To maximize production, the factory would make chocolate ice cream, as it has a higher production rate.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

However, if the factory were to make vanilla ice cream for the entire 48 hours, the total quarts would be 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

To find the total possible quarts, we'll consider the maximum production scenario, which is making chocolate ice cream for the entire 48 hours.

The final answer is: 2400"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items he purchased.

The cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
The discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to consider the cost and the deal offered. Since each scoop costs $1.50, buying 2 scoops would cost $3.00, and she would get the third scoop for free. This means she would get 3 scoops for $3.00.

With $6.00, Erin can afford to buy 4 sets of 2 scoops (4 * $3.00 = $12.00 is more than she has, but 3 sets of 2 scoops would be 3 * $3.00 = $9.00, which is more than she has as well). However, she can afford 2 sets of 2 scoops (2 * $3.00 = $6.00). 

Since 2 sets of 2 scoops would give her 2 * 3 = 6 scoops of ice cream, this is the optimal number of scoops she should buy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy. 
Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.
Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To determine the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can calculate this area as follows:

Area to be covered = (2/3) * 36 sq ft
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. To find the total number of tiles needed, we can multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

Total tiles needed = Area to be covered * Tiles per square foot
Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft
Total tiles needed = 576 tiles

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking and compare it to the cost of buying at the store.

The cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store for $2.5 per pound.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices, we need to first determine the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. However, the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is 0.1 * $700 = $70.

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers at the new price.

Total amount = Number of computers * New price per computer
Total amount = 500 * $770
Total amount = $385,000

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga's arms are raised, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices left, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

"To find the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time the dog takes. Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which gives us 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total length of 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

Now, let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation. We know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can write the equation as:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

9x = 90

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9, which gives us:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows from the students' cars.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows from the teachers' cars.

Now, we can find the total number of windows smashed by adding the number of windows smashed from the students' and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

However, we are not given any information about adding more students. Instead, we are asked how many more groups are needed to form. Since we already have 6 groups, and the activity requires 12 groups, we simply subtract the number of groups we have from the number of groups required: 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 groups.

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in two 4-week months.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 
- The number of chairs rented on weekdays is 60 * 5 = 300.
- The number of chairs rented on weekends is 100 * 2 = 200.
- The total number of chairs rented in a week is 300 + 200 = 500.

Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out is 500 * 8 = 4000.

"To find the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. So, Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold stole 12 bananas that evening, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual electricity bill. 

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual electricity bill is $100 * 12 = $1200.

Now, we need to divide the total annual electricity bill by the number of roommates, which is 5 (including Jenna). 

$1200 / 5 = $240

"To determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the initial number of glasses and plates he had, and then subtract the number of broken items.

1 dozen is equal to 12 items. So, Jeff initially had:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

After the event, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find the remaining number of glasses and plates, we subtract the broken items from the initial number:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining number of glasses and plates:
Total = 86 (glasses) + 42 (plates) = 128

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading them for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

The rest of her large stickers, which is 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers, are traded for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading 50% of her large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for easier counting. 9 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 29 large buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding the 60 small buttons she got from trading the rest of her large stickers, she has a total of 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

However, the question asks for the total number of buttons, not just small buttons. Since we already converted all the large buttons to small buttons, we can just count the total number of small buttons as the total number of buttons.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to calculate the matches played on each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches. 
On Friday, he played 1 match.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

The total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is '2x'. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and since each member votes either in favor or against, the total number of votes is also 33. Therefore, the sum of votes in favor and against is equal to 33.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

1. Extra-small: 11 students
2. Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students
3. Medium: Four less than the number of small students, so 22 - 4 = 18 students
4. Large: Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
5. Extra-large: Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, we add up the number of students for each size to find the total number of shirts ordered.

11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people

Now, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is the remaining people after subtracting those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Since there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

where P is the total number of Pomeranians. To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. We can set up another equation:

2/3 * T = 18

where T is the total number of puppies. To solve for T, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has in total. Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as x. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house will need 2x cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first, so it will need 2x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases needed is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

Since the third house needs 2x cases of shingles, it will need 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

First, we find 45% of 200 bananas. 
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we add 90 to the number of bananas.
200 + 90 = 290 pears

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits.
200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits

"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first calculate the amount of money she spent on the candy bars. 

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on the ball, so the amount of money she had left for the candy bars is $80 - $20 = $60.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can find the number of candy bars she bought by dividing the amount of money she spent on candy bars ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5).

Number of candy bars = $60 / $5 = 12

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation:

Ezra's books = 2 * Ahmed's books
300 = 2 * Ahmed's books

To find Ahmed's books, we divide both sides by 2:

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra's total books will be:

Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals:

Total books = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's books
Total books = 450 + 150
Total books = 600

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours taught would be 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday would be $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours taught would be 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30. Since she taught less than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To determine the price at which Bennet should sell each ear of corn, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has already made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from selling eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount he made from selling eggplants from his total desired amount: $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, we know that Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find the price at which he should sell each ear of corn, we can divide the total amount he needs to make from selling corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn he has (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To determine the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total hours available and the hours spent on activities other than soccer.

Total hours available: 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Hours spent reading: 3 hours

Remaining hours after reading: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Hours spent playing video games: 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Hours spent on activities other than soccer: 3 hours (reading) + 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours

Hours spent playing soccer: Total hours - hours spent on other activities = 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the hours spent playing soccer by the total hours and multiply by 100:

Percentage spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can calculate the time spent driving to the museum:

time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours.

The total time spent driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Adding the 6 hours Jack spends at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is:

4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the collection into three categories: movies in series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Movies in series = 600 / 3 = 200 movies

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 of the cost of a normal movie by buying the series together, we can assume the cost of each movie in a series is $6.

Now, let's calculate the number of remaining movies:

Remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. We can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Older movies = 400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. We can calculate the number of normal movies as follows:

Normal movies = 400 - 160 = 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the total cost of replacing the movie collection:

Cost of movies in series = 200 * $6 = $1200
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Now, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked

"To determine the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them receives from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as 'x'. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. 

The points they receive from jumping on enemies are:
- Emma: 10x
- Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's denote the number of berries Emma collects as 'y'. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

The points they receive from collecting berries are:
- Emma: 5y
- Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's denote the remaining time on the timer for Emma as 't'. Ava's remaining time will be 't - 4'.

The points they receive from the remaining time are:

First, we find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars. Since there are two of them, we multiply 30 by 2, which equals 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract 60 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas, which is 64 dollars. This gives us 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2. This gives us 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

On the usual days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. Since there are two people, the total number of rides on these days is:
2 people * 3 rides/day * 5 days = 30 rides

On the non-usual days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. This means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. Since there are 2 non-usual days, the total number of rides on these days is:
2 people * 6 rides/day * 2 days = 24 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the non-usual days to get the total number of rides in a week:
30 rides + 24 rides = 54 rides

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that x + y = 17, since he bought 17 fish in total.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had 3 + y orange fish and 4 + x white fish. According to the problem, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + y = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

y = 5 + 2x

Since x + y = 17, we can substitute y with 5 + 2x:

x + (5 + 2x) = 17

Combine like terms:

3x + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide by 3:

x = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total fuel consumption.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of trips per week is 2 (to and from work) * 5 (days) = 10 trips.

The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the total distance traveled per week is 10 trips * 10 miles (5 miles * 2) = 100 miles.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total fuel consumption per week is 100 miles / 10 MPG = 10 gallons.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to calculate the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day, the temperature at night would be:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees. To find out how many degrees he needs to raise the temperature, we subtract the current temperature from the desired temperature:

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Given that every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed by dividing the total degrees needed by the degrees per log:

20 / 5 = 4

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people, we can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we are told that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups that brought back seashells = (3/5) * Number of groups
= (3/5) * 10
= 6

Since each group has 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by multiplying the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member.

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of members per group * Number of seashells per member
= 6 * 9 * 2
= 108

"To determine the number of people on the train, we need to consider the initial number of people and the changes that occurred at each stop.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people got off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125 people. Then, 13 more people got on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138 people.

At the next stop, 38 people got off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train.

The final number of people on the train is 100."
"To determine the amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he collects and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien collects 10 bottle caps per day. In a 30-day month, he would collect 10 * 30 = 300 bottle caps.

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is 300 * $0.25 = $75.

"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break down her work hours into regular and additional hours. 

Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work, so her regular earnings are 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours (11 total hours - 8 regular hours), she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. Her earnings for the additional hours are 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are the sum of her regular earnings and her earnings for the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we can calculate the number of male lions as 12 / 2 = 6.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% = 0.25). 

Discount amount = $40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find out how much money he will have left over.

Money left over = $50 - $30 = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money paid to the employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money paid after three months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:
$1,040,000 per month * 3 months
= $3,120,000

Total amount of money paid: $3,120,000"

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50, making his new hourly wage $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00, making his current hourly wage $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial hourly wage, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20 = $230
Sally's earnings: $10.50 * 20 = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita by adding their individual scores:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150
Total points = 428

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, so the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted: 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so the number of stuffed goats 'x' should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x).

We can set up the equation as follows:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Cross-multiplying:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the equation:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play, we first need to calculate the total hours she has played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has played from the total hours required: 
30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far apart they will be after 2 hours:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the total cost of the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the materials, which is the sum of the cost of the diamond and the gold. 

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the premium James paid for the ring to be made. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the materials. 

To calculate the premium, we multiply the total cost of the materials by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%). So, the premium is $900 * 0.30 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid. 

The total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

700/1000 = 0.7 
0.7 * 100 = 70

"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available glass chips. Since each square inch requires 12 chips, and he has 2 bags of 72 chips each, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Now, we can calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create:

Total square inches = Total chips / 12 chips/square inch = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can calculate the length by dividing the total square inches by the height:

Length = Total square inches / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining amount of tea.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount of tea consumed:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. He then sold 150 candies, but since he didn't have them yet, this means he took orders for 150 candies. To fulfill these orders, he ordered 100 more candies. However, this still doesn't meet the demand, so we can assume he will order more.

The total number of candies Dale has ordered so far is 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

Since Dale took orders for 150 candies, and he now has 200 candies, we can subtract the number of orders from the total number of candies he has to find out how many he still needs to sell: 200 (total candies) - 150 (orders) = 50.

However, this is the number of candies he has in excess of the orders. To find out how many more he needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we need to consider that he wants to sell all 200 candies. Since he already has orders for 150, he needs to sell the remaining 50 candies to meet his goal.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of exponential growth, which is a fundamental idea in mathematics and philosophy, particularly in the realm of ontology and the study of change.

Given that the number of students doubles every month, we can model this growth using a geometric progression. Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students at the end of each month would be as follows:

- January: 10 * 2 = 20
- February: 20 * 2 = 40
- March: 40 * 2 = 80
- April: 80 * 2 = 160
- May: 160 * 2 = 320

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May above and beyond the initial number, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May.

Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). 

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are two kids). 

14 / 2 = 7

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then add them up.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, which means they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, they will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which means he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'f', the amount of salt as 's', the amount of sugar as 'g', and the amount of oil as 'o'. 

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have z = f. 
Given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have s = g. 
Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have o = 2s. 
Given that she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have s = 2z.

Since s = 2z and o = 2s, we can express o in terms of z: o = 2(2z) = 4z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation: z + f + s + g + o = 10.

Substituting the equalities we have found, we get: z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 (since z = f, s = 2z, g = s, and o = 4z).

Combining like terms, we get: 10z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get: z = 1.

Now, we can find the amount of oil (o) in terms of z: o = 4z = 4(1) = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick's cards can be represented as 3x. 

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca's cards can be represented as 3x + 12.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick's cards = 3x = 3 * 47 = 141

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost based on weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original cost of the book is $32.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the original cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

"To determine how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow a series of steps. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Mulan initially has, which is the sum of the money she already had and the money her father gave her. 
Initial money = $40 (Mulan's money) + $100 (father's money) = $140.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the items Mulan bought. 
Cost of jeans = 2 * $30 = $60.
Cost of bag = $20.
Total cost = $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial money to find out how much money Mulan has left.
Money left = Initial money - Total cost = $140 - $80 = $60.

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
   Britany records 18 videos per week, each 4 minutes long. 
   Time spent recording per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Time spent recording per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours/week writing songs. 
   Time spent writing songs per month = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
   Convert hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

3. Time spent on makeup: 
   Britany spends 15 minutes/day, 6 days a week on makeup. 
   Time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Time spent on makeup per month = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
Total time spent on TikTok per month = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours

However, the question does not explicitly ask for the answer in hours, so we will provide the answer in minutes.

"To determine the total cost of installation for Angela, we need to break down the items into those included in the initial installation and those that require additional charges.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of items that exceed the initial installation:
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial) = 10 additional pictures

The total number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. The cost of additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the total cost of additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the cost of the initial installation plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei's ability.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first leg of his journey and the second leg, then add them together.

In the first leg, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can calculate the distance covered in the first leg as follows:

distance = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

In the second leg, Mason travels at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance covered in the second leg as follows:

distance = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we can add the distances covered in the first and second legs to find the total distance traveled:

total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, we divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for one kangaroo. 

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time it takes for a turtle to cross the highway will be twice the time it takes a kangaroo. 

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all four turtles to cross the highway will be the same as the time it takes for one turtle.

Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each individual to find the total number of clay dishes made by all three: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in discount.

The laptop costs $600, but with the trade-in discount, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she currently has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Since we know that $230 of this amount comes from her part-time job and her mom, the amount she has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find the total number of apple slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam obtained from the large and small apples. 

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam sliced 3 large apples. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam sliced 5 small apples. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices Adam obtained: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the milk production per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it has been used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it has been used. 
1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can determine the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. 

Jack's socks = 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. 

Peter's socks = 2 * Jack's socks = 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. 

Peter's dishes = 1/2 * Jack's dishes = 1/2 * 60 = 30 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes each of them has.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks.
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.

Total number of socks and dishes = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180.

Students good at both subjects = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
Students good at both subjects = 20 - (5 + 8)
Students good at both subjects = 20 - 13

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time required for each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time required for each group (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform:

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: Mom's age = 3B - 1
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

We can simplify the equation by substituting A from the first two equations into the fourth equation. Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can also express S in terms of B: S = B - 5 (by substituting A = B - 3 into A = S + 2).

Now, substitute A and S in terms of B into the fourth equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Given that the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. 

Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as:
S = A + 25

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as:
A = F - 12

We are also given that the total number of books is 85, so we can write this as:
S + A + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F. 

First, substitute S = A + 25 into the third equation:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we are told that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To determine the total amount Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required and then find out how many boxes of jello he needs to buy.

Each kid will have 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids. So, the total number of jello cups required is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.

The cost of one box of jello is $1.25. Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is 12 * $1.25 = $15.

"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00. 

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 
3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points.

True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points.

Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he will sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue from selling the chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we can rearrange the equation:

Total cost = $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the original rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will receive is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and since Sarah is using the profit to buy it, we need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40. 

$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters

Since Sarah can buy 26.67 meters of the new rope, the cost of the new rope will be:

26.67 meters * $1.5/meter = $40

However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes she is spending all her money on the new rope. To find the correct length of the new rope she can buy, we should find the maximum length of the new rope that is less than or equal to the original rope's length, which is 20 meters.

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit:

$40 - $30 = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Melanie's current age. We are given that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. After 'x' years, her age will be 8 + x. We are given that this will be thrice her present age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24

To solve for 'x', we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8
x = 16

However, this is the total number of years from now when her age will be 24. Since we want to know in how many years from now her age will be thrice her present age, we need to subtract her current age from this total number of years.

But in this case, we are looking for the number of years from now, so the answer is simply the number of years it takes for her to be 24 years old from her current age of 8.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. To find the speed of the whirligig, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to calculate how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that the payment is for one mowing. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, earning 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, earning 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from mowing lawns. She earned $6 from Joe, $18 from Kamala, and $30 from Alba. So, her total earnings from mowing lawns are $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the total number of bowls the family will eat for dinner and subtract that from the total capacity of the pot.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 2 adults and 2 children will be eating dinner, we can calculate the total number of bowls as follows:

- 2 adults = 2 adult bowls
- 2 children = 2 child bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls), the total number of bowls used for dinner is 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls = 2 + 2 = 4 child bowls (in terms of child bowls) + 2 adult bowls. However, we can convert the 2 adult bowls to child bowls for easier calculation: 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls. So, the total number of bowls used for dinner is 4 child bowls + 4 child bowls = 6 child bowls.

Now, subtract the total number of bowls used for dinner from the total capacity of the pot (in terms of child bowls): 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup (2 child bowls) by the number of children (2) to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, the total material needed for the small masks is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round up to 3 since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the material needed for 8 masks directly). The material needed for 3 large masks is 2.25 yards, so for 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed as (8/3) * 2.25 = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the number of marbles he gave away and subtract that from the total number of marbles he initially had.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he had 30 marbles, 1/5 of 30 is 30 * (1/5) = 6 marbles.

He also gave 10 marbles to Donald.

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. We are given that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If we express this mathematically, we get:

(D - 8) = 2 * (A - 4)

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

(60 - 8) = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2 * (A - 4)

Now, we can solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8
52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can calculate it as follows:

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of the two farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

"To determine Colby's earnings, we first need to calculate the number of packages he completes per hour. It is given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so the number of packages completed per hour is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Colby earns $0.20 per package, his hourly earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages completed per hour by the amount earned per package: 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

To find his total earnings for an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours worked: $8 * 8 = $64.

"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we first need to calculate the time it takes him to solve the extreme sudoku. 

An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku, which is 45 minutes. Therefore, the time taken to solve an extreme sudoku is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we need to divide the total time taken to solve the extreme sudoku by 30 to find the number of bottles he drinks.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we can use a bit of logical reasoning. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18. We also know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. 

To find the number of yellow balloons, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon (3). 

y = 18 / 3
y = 6

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we must first calculate the total miles driven in a month. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, the total miles driven is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Given that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups to find the number of tune-ups needed. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) is 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount they had initially is $28. 

Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$28 / 2 = $14

"To determine the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops and subtract the total cost of purchasing them.

First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold. Since there are 30 students and each student sold 10 lollipops on average, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300.

The total revenue from selling the lollipops is the number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price per lollipop, which is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

The total cost of purchasing the lollipops is the number of lollipops sold multiplied by the cost per lollipop, which is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

The total profit made by the class is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, we can add up the number of each type of pet to find the total number of pets Larry has: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. 

The total number of slices they can eat in a day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we can divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices they can eat in a day (6) to find out how many days the loaf will last.

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will turn 10 years old. The difference between these two ages is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea in each row is 12 / 3 = 4. 

As the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row is equal, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4 / 2 = 2.

Colby's initial budget is $150. 

He spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, which is 5 * $10 = $50. 
He spent money on 8 movies on other days at $7 each, which is 8 * $7 = $56. 
He spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, which is 2 * $8 = $16. 
He spent money on 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, which is 4 * $2 = $8.

Total money spent is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

His remaining budget is $150 - $130 = $20.

Since he wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) that night, he will spend $10 on those items. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10. He can only afford 1 movie with his remaining budget.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has (1/3) * 600 = 200 calories.

Next, let's find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A mini blueberry muffin has (1/3) * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories of the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories of the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories of the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins to find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked. The total calories are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Total number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car

"To solve this problem, let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J. We are given the following information:

1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can start by substituting the second equation into the third equation to express P in terms of J:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute this expression for P into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using the second equation:

L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the third equation:

P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. 
So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

Now, let's calculate the amount he received from selling 5 of them. He sold 5 CDs for $40, but we need to find the cost of these 5 CDs to determine his loss. 

The original price of 5 CDs is 5 * $15 = $75.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's calculate the distance James swam initially. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile distance, we can find the distance as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can calculate the initial swimming time using James' pace of 2 miles per hour:

Initial swimming time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

Resting time = Initial swimming time / 2 = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

After resting, James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed. The remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum initially = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half his original speed, his new speed is:

New speed = Original speed / 2 = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can calculate the final swimming time:

Final swimming time = Remaining distance / New speed = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to cross the lake by adding the initial swimming time, resting time, and final swimming time:

Total time = Initial swimming time + Resting time + Final swimming time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has, we must consider the initial number of stickers she received, the number she lost, and the additional stickers she received.

Initially, Jasmine received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we must subtract those from the initial amount: 15 - 7 = 8.

After losing the stickers, Jasmine had 8 stickers. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers she has now, we add the additional stickers to the number she already had: 8 + 5 = 13.

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission earned from each newspaper and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times: 
6 copies * $5 per copy = $30 total sales
10% commission on $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 per copy = $150 total sales
8% commission on $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: 
$3 (New York Times) + $12 (Wall Street Journal) = $15

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship as:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To solve this problem, let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, the points scored by Dinar as D, and the points scored by Bahati as B. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10, which gives A = D - 10.

Now, we can substitute A = D - 10 and B = D + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45. This gives (D - 10) + (D + 10) + D = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3D = 45. Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15.

Now that we know D = 15, we can find A by using A = D - 10. So, A = 15 - 10 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches. The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

"To determine the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his rate of stapling.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 15 hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15: 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the number of reports stapled per set: 60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports.

"To determine the total number of minutes Kim slept in her bed, we first need to calculate her total sleep time and then subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so her actual sleep time that day was 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking, which is 23 minutes (from 2:15 to 2:38 am).

So, the total time she slept in her bed is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen (24) cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24
Number of measuring spoons = 16

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons, for a total of 40 utensils. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:

Number of measuring cups = 24
Number of measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10
Total number of utensils = 24 + 10 = 34

"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:
Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Now, we can calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds:
Initial unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted into the hospital in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) as follows:
Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we can calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial occupied beds + Total patients admitted in 2 weeks
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we can calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks:
Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks
Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"To find Shawna's father's age, we first need to determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract that from the number she reported.

Courtney reported 48 people in attendance. 20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6. 

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a person attending a concert.

"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine the number of balls each boy carried. We know Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball. 

We also know Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we can find the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Total number of balls: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. 

At the end of the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes. 

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. 

40 (total holes at the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total holes at the end of the third day) = 11.

"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to consider the amount each person received. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Collins, on the other hand, received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey. 

So, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amount each person received: 
70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.5.

$400 * 0.5 = $200

Now, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.

$400 + $200 = $600

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each person. 

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
X = S + 5

We are also given that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:
S = 4A - 13

Now, we can substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
A + 2S = 334

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the equation above:
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334

Expand the equation:
A + 8A - 26 = 334

Combine like terms:
9A - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13:
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we first need to determine the total number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10

Now, to find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north in this segment, the distance traveled is subtracted from the total distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can find the net distance by adding the distances traveled in the first and third segments and subtracting the distance traveled in the second segment:
Net Distance = Distance (first segment) + Distance (third segment) - Distance (second segment)
Net Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net Distance = 374 miles

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she initially had. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges: 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the costs of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 
Total cost = cost of dictionary + cost of dinosaur book + cost of children's cookbook
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler already has $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.
Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14
Amount needed = $25

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount needed by his hourly wage.
Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $25 / $5
Number of hours = 5

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. We can calculate Jerry's cherries by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total.
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

"To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each item on both days and then multiply by their respective prices.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item over the two days:
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old. 

Now, to find the current age of Emil's dad, we need to subtract the years that will pass until Emil turns 24 from his dad's age at that time. Since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years, we subtract 5 years from his dad's age at that time: 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Next, we know that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. So, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's brother, we subtract the years that will pass until Emil turns 24 from his brother's age at that time: 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers she needs to fill her flower bed. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each flower takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each flower. So, the total space taken up by each flower and the space between it and the next flower is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each flower and the space between it and the next flower (30 inches) to find the total number of flowers Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a flower, we round up to the nearest whole number, so Pat needs 45 flowers.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations, then subtract that from the total amount of soil available.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total amount of soil used by sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total amount of soil used by carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used by sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3.

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year and then divide that by the cost of each pair of shoes.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 25% of $2,000.00 is $500.00 per month. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year is $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To determine the time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find her cooking rate per minute:

30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute

Now, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her cooking rate:

90 shrimp / 3 shrimp per minute = 30 minutes

However, this is not the total time it will take Emily to cook 90 shrimp, since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. We can divide 90 shrimp by 30 shrimp to find the number of batches she needs to cook:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch = 3 batches

Since each batch takes 10 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of batches by the cooking time per batch:

3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

Now, we can add the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to cook the shrimp to find the total time:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time period.

Initially, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This results in a total warming of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the total cooling effect minus the total warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad will see the Comet again 75 years later. However, we are interested in Bill's age, so we need to find out when Bill saw the Comet.

We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it for the second time. However, we are interested in when Bill saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the Comet for the second time at 90 years old, he must have seen it for the first time 75 years earlier.

So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of bill and then add them together.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany combined is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 11 flights.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12. The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to determine the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. 

The average age of the group can be calculated as the total age divided by the number of children: 
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can calculate her age as follows:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We are given the ages of Akbar (3 years old) and Alessandro (4 years old). We can now calculate the total age of the three known children:
Total age of known children = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age
Total age of known children = 3 + 4 + 10
Total age of known children = 17

Since the total age of all children is 20, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the total age of the known children from the total age of all children:
Wilfred's age = Total age of all children - Total age of known children
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The total amount collected from the neighbors is $500. The total amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these two amounts together, we get $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about the neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

The lawyer will donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. 

Since there were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, if each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can calculate the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To solve this problem, let's consider the total number of slices as a unit. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x' and the size of each adult's slice as '2x'.

We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices can be represented as:

2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x

Now, we want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2x, we can divide 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. Since there are 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. There are 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these activities: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic to find the time left to update records: 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to prepare the cake and then subtract that from the serving time.

The total time required to prepare the cake is as follows:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total preparation time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total preparation time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total preparation time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. The total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes in total, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first determine the total cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per month.

The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student. 

Cost per session = Fixed cost + (Variable cost per student * Number of students)
Cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10)
Cost per session = $25 + $15
Cost per session = $40

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month can be calculated as follows:

Number of sessions per month = Number of sessions per week * Number of weeks in a month
Assuming a month has 4 weeks, 
Number of sessions per month = 3 * 4
Number of sessions per month = 12

Now, we can calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month by multiplying the cost per session by the number of sessions per month.

Expected earnings per month = Cost per session * Number of sessions per month
Expected earnings per month = $40 * 12
Expected earnings per month = $480

"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * Total population
= 3/5 * 50
= 30

Now, we know that each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born to each female porcupine in a year is:

Total babies per female porcupine per year = 4 babies/month * 12 months
= 48 babies

The total number of babies born in a year is the product of the number of female porcupines and the total babies per female porcupine per year:

Total babies in a year = Number of female porcupines * Total babies per female porcupine per year
= 30 * 48
= 1440

Finally, to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the initial population and the total number of babies born in a year:

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total babies in a year
= 50 + 1440

Volume = 25 × 14 × 4 = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 × 5.9 = 8260 gallons

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - 5 * (9% of x) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
0.55x - 3 * (7% of 0.55x) = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4345x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
0.4345x = 28% of the total capacity
0.4345x = 0.28

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 0.28 / 0.4345
x ≈ 0.644

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:
x ≈ 64.4%

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We are also given that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa's total earnings from the sales are $120. This can be represented as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the earnings from the small stuffed animals:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into this equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can now find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week, she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week, he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, we add the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

"To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are the sum of her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left: $320 - $20 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day, and then multiply that by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

First, we know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To calculate this, we need to find 50% of 24 pounds and add it to 24 pounds. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we multiply the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day (36 pounds) by the number of dwarves (40) and the number of days (30). 

40 * 36 * 30 = 43200

"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can analyze the given information and apply the concept of proportionality. 

The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6. We can calculate the price per sandwich for each package to establish a basis for comparison.

For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains constant across all packages. Therefore, we can use this price per sandwich to calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Price per sandwich: $1.50
Number of sandwiches in the third package: 8

Price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 8 * $1.50 = $12

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

The original price of the new bedroom set is $3000. After using the $1000, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is: 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance that the whole class will get an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension to the whole class (50% * 60% = 30%), there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension to the whole class, and giving Marcus a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher and class extension) + 6% (normal teacher, no class extension, and personal extension) = 76%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

Now, we need to divide the seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the given information. Since there are 950 seats for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

We know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can calculate the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. 

Since 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans, 150 medium-sized beans would be equal to 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so she spends 3 * 3 = $9.

Her total earnings after expenses are $45 - $9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place in his driveway. 

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we can calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains by multiplying the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each bottle:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. Since the bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, and the fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, we add 2 feet to each dimension.

The new length is 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet.
The new width is 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length and width:
Area = length * width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we'll subtract that from the total losses.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x.

We know that the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x' (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4
First set = 6 + 4
First set = 10

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the doctor's time, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.
The doctor's time is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Since the doctor charges $300/hour, the cost of the doctor's time is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
The cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find the number of emails James responds to in a day, we first need to calculate the number of emails that don't require a response. 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 
64 * 5 = 320

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to calculate the total score and then divide it by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so his total score for those tests is 100 * 3 = 300. Adding the 80 he scored on his 4th test, his total score becomes 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4. So, the average score is 380 / 4 = 95.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas they ate, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14. This means they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas. This means they have 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the number of pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team: 6 + 8 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons, and each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. So, the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:

700 small coupons * 5 cents/small coupon = 700 * 0.05 = $35

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:

1400 big coupons * 15 cents/big coupon = 1400 * 0.15 = $210

Finally, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

$35 + $210 = $245

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we can calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:

Number of trucks that delivered = Number of trucks dispatched - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers as follows:

Total tons of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that delivered * Tons of fertiliser per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

"To determine the cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total number of pounds Dennis needs and then apply the promotion. 

Since Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for one pound at full price ($4.00) and the second pound at half price ($2.00). 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

Since there are three sets, the total cost will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then find the additional guests beyond the initial 20.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. The total number of invited guests is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests attending the party is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee covers 20 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

Then, he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

In total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces during that hour.

"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 individual roses for $2 each. The total cost is $15 + (3 * $2) = $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters by dividing the change by the value of a quarter: $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to break down the arrival and departure times of each train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. It will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station at time 0 (when the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes), we can calculate the total waiting time for Paul as the difference between the arrival time of the fourth train and the initial time.

Total waiting time = Arrival time of the fourth train - Initial time
Total waiting time = 145 - 0
Total waiting time = 145 minutes

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect. The number of toothpicks she still needs is 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week. We can do this by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she collects per week: 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down James' journey into three parts: walking halfway to the store, walking back home, and then walking the entire distance to the store.

1. Walking halfway to the store: Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway would be 2 miles. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take James 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk halfway.

2. Walking back home: James needs to walk the 2 miles back home, which would take him another 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

3. Walking the entire distance to the store: After returning home, James needs to walk the entire 4 miles to the store. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take him 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

Now, we add up the time taken for each part of the journey: 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 1 hour = 2 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.

If Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of proportionality, which is a fundamental idea in philosophy of mathematics. The growth rate of the crocodile is constant, so we can set up a proportion to relate the growth in 4 years to the growth in 13 years.

Let's denote the growth in 13 years as x. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we can set up the following proportion:

8 inches / 4 years = x inches / 13 years

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

8 × 13 = 4x
104 = 4x
x = 104 / 4
x = 26

"To determine Marcel's total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the respective price.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. 
Number of Trekking bikes = 300 * 0.5 = 150 bikes
Price of one Trekking bike = $450
Total earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Next, 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 
Number of BMX bikes = 300 * 0.15 = 45 bikes
Price of one BMX bike = $500 / 2 = $250 (since it's half the price of an MTB)
Total earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. 
Number of MTB bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes
Price of one MTB bike = $500
Total earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, we can calculate Marcel's total earnings by adding the earnings from each type of bike.
Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

First, let's calculate the time spent in class per day. John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2/16 of his weekly minutes. So, the extra learning time per week is 2/16 * 10080 = 1260 minutes.

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time, which is 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent learning per week is 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex must have been twice the amount the Allosaurus ate. 

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate must have been twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

Therefore, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a single gallon of paint. 

First, let's calculate the surface area of the north and south walls. Since there are two walls with the same dimensions, we can calculate the area of one wall and multiply it by 2. 

Area of north/south wall = length * height = 10 * 8 = 80 square feet
Total area of north/south walls = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet

Next, let's calculate the surface area of the east and west walls. 

Area of east/west wall = length * height = 5 * 8 = 40 square feet
Total area of east/west walls = 2 * 40 = 80 square feet

Now, let's calculate the total surface area of all the walls. 

Total surface area = Total area of north/south walls + Total area of east/west walls
Total surface area = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total surface area by the coverage of a single gallon. 

Number of gallons = Total surface area / Coverage per gallon
Number of gallons = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 12 * 12 = 144

Now, when Ellen's friend comes along, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find the total distance between them.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To determine the number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then subtract the returned amount from the initial charge.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. She returned an item worth $15.00, so the remaining balance is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discounts:
Frying pan: 20% off $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00 discount
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
Set of towels: 10% off $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00 discount
Set of towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total amount spent on the frying pan and the set of towels is:
$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Now, add this amount to the remaining balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

New balance: $113.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to establish the ages of Ben and Chris first. We know Chris is 4 years old. 

Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2. 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, the number of years she needs to work is less than 40. However, without knowing the exact number of years she has already worked, we can't provide an exact answer.

However, if we assume she just started working, then she needs to work for 40 years to reach her goal."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to establish the relationship between the percentage of boys and the total population. Since 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total population = 240

To find the total population, we can convert the percentage to a decimal and solve for the total population:

0.4 * total population = 240

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Total cost = Cost of pots + Cost of garden soil
Total cost = $19 + $26
Total cost = $45

Now, let's subtract the discount from the coupon:
Total amount spent = Total cost - Discount
Total amount spent = $45 - $7

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has available for hiking in June. Since June has 30 days, we can assume she will hike for 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, which means she will cover 250 miles per day (2 * 125 miles). To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the planned miles from the required miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

Since she hikes twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles by 2 to find out how many more miles per hike she needs to cover:

60 miles per day / 2 hikes per day = 30 miles per hike

However, the question asks for the additional miles per day, not per hike. Therefore, the answer remains the same as the additional miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"

"To determine how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to calculate how much Peter and Paul want. 

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount of apples Peter and Paul want is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, and we are looking for how many kilograms James will have left, we need to correct the names. Assuming James is Jacques, we subtract the amount Peter and Paul want from the total amount of apples.

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he had initially and then subtract the amount he spent.

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then saved $11 from his allowance, so the total amount of money he had became $21 + $11 = $32.

After that, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

After buying the two books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. This means that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the two books by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

Rate = 255 blinks / 5 minutes
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it will take for the light to blink 459 times:

Time = Total blinks / Rate
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes Tate has after buying the additional fishes.

Initially, Tate has 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 male fishes. He buys 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, so the total number of male fishes becomes 7 + 2 + 2 = 11.

Initially, Tate has 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 7 + 5 = 12 female fishes. He buys 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so the total number of female fishes becomes 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, to find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"To determine the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each individual.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, but it is stated that she took ""well over 4 hours longer."" This implies that Dior took at least 4 hours longer than Amalia, but the exact time is not specified. However, for the purpose of calculation, we will assume that ""well over 4 hours"" means 4 hours longer, as we do not have any other information. Therefore, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by all three:

Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
Total time = 4 + 6 + 8
Total time = 18

"To determine the total miles driven by John in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we calculate the distance of a one-way trip. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, we can find the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:

Total miles per month = 2 * 280 miles
Total miles per month = 560 miles

"To determine the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to first calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, the total distance she will walk in seven days is 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days, we can set up a proportion to find the distance Brian will walk. Let's denote the distance Brian will walk as x. The proportion is then 2x = 70 miles, where 2x represents the distance Sofie will walk.

To find the distance Brian will walk, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: x = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. 

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys. 

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional work done after the 10-hour shift will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, we are told that after the 10-hour shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's in each small bag, which is 10. 

So, the number of small bags John can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * 600
Speed of fastest car = 750 miles per hour

Solving for Vince's age two years ago, we get Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide by 2:

x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number Arnold painted:

Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the total number of logs is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, John can cut 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Grandma's speed on the beach and the sidewalk. We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. 

Let's denote her speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since distance = speed * time, we can write the equation for the beach as 2 = x * (40/60), because we need to convert 40 minutes to hours. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2 = x * (2/3), which gives us x = 3 miles per hour. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. 

Now, we can calculate the time she spends walking on the sidewalk. The distance she covers on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and her speed is 6 miles per hour. 

Time = distance / speed = 1 / 6 hours, which is equal to 10 minutes. 

The total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of thermal equilibrium and the idea that the final temperature of the mixture is a weighted average of the initial temperatures of the two components.

Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x. When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the final temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x) = 5 oz * 40°F

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = 68

However, this is the temperature of the second mug, and we want to find the minimum temperature that would allow Donny to drink the water. Since the final temperature of the mixture is 40°F, the second mug must be at least as hot as the final temperature. But since it's mixed with a colder liquid, it must be hotter than 40°F to bring the average up to 40°F.

To find the minimum temperature, we can set up a proportion:

(1 oz * x) / (5 oz) = (40°F - 33°F) / (x - 33°F)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x / 5 = 7 / (x - 33)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

x(x - 33) = 35

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

x^2 - 33x - 35 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

(x - 35)(x + 1) = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 35 or x = -1

Since temperature cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of animals and the additional animals brought in by Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens, making a total of 70 animals.

In one day, 20 cows and 10 chickens are added. So, the total number of animals added per day is 20 + 10 = 30.

Since this process continues for three weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals added in 21 days: 30 animals/day * 21 days = 630 animals.

Adding the initial number of animals to the total number of animals added, we get: 70 (initial animals) + 630 (added animals) = 700 animals.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs with 9 bagels each, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he consumes in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding them together: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total: 60 - 51 = 9.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he collects per year and then multiply it by the number of years in a decade.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, the total number of lemons he collects per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

A decade consists of 10 years. Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus before 20 women alight. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can express the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x, where x is a common multiplier. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus before 20 women alight. The number of women is 9x, which is 9 * 6 = 54.

Since 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we first need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and bouquets sold.

Let's start with the bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from individual sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of individual sunflowers and sunflowers sold in bouquets, which is 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3: 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks. Since he sells 60% of 20 rocks, he sells:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:

12 * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$100 - $84 = $16

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. To draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, she will need 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. To draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, she will need 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. To draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, she will need 49 / 7 = 7 days.

However, Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes simultaneously. To find the total number of days, we need to consider the most efficient way for her to complete the project.

One possible approach is to calculate the total number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the maximum number of days. However, this approach may not be the most efficient.

A more efficient approach is to consider the number of days required to complete the project in a way that minimizes the total number of days. Since Lauren can work on different types of picture scenes simultaneously, we can calculate the total number of days by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days required for each type of picture scene.

However, in this case, we can simply add the fractions of days for each type of picture scene. 

9 + 6 + 7 is not the correct answer. We need to find the least common multiple of 5, 6, and 7, which is 210. Then we divide 45 by 5, 36 by 6, and 49 by 7, and multiply each result by the LCM, and divide by the LCM. 

(45 * 42) + (36 * 35) + (49 * 30) = 1890 + 1260 + 1470 = 4620. Then we divide 4620 by 210, which is 22.

The final answer is: 22"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, which has a 20% chance of winning, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. This is because the two events are independent, and the outcome of one does not affect the other.

Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of first ticket winning * Probability of second ticket winning

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, the number of additional bottles they need to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple, blue, and bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

The number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, let's calculate the number of babies wearing bows. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 of them are wearing purple. To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

Given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Number of pods in the regular box = 100
Number of additional pods in the new box = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod and then divide $1 by the cost per pod.

Cost per pod = Total cost / Total number of pods
Cost per pod = $12 / 120
Cost per pod = $0.1

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run for $1:

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. Since 20% of the original 5-inch chalk is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch, we can calculate the amount of chalk used each day as a percentage of the remaining chalk. However, to simplify the calculation, we can calculate the amount of chalk used each day as a percentage of the original 5-inch chalk and then apply it to the remaining chalk.

20% of the original 5-inch chalk is 1 inch. To find the amount of chalk used each day, we can multiply the remaining chalk by 0.20 and divide by 5, then multiply by the remaining chalk: (0.20/5) * remaining chalk = 0.04 * remaining chalk.

However, a more straightforward approach is to calculate the number of days it will take to use up the remaining chalk. The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left and uses 20% of the original 5-inch chalk each day, which is 1 inch. To find the number of days, we can divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day, but we need to find the amount used each day as a fraction of the remaining chalk.

Since the teacher uses 1 inch of the original 5-inch chalk each day, we can set up a proportion to find the amount used each day as a fraction of the remaining chalk: 1 inch / 5 inches = x / 2.75 inches.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine how many face masks ""thrice as many as Mike"" would be. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, thrice as many would be 3 * 5 = 15. 

Johnny bought 2 more than that, so we add 2 to 15. 

15 + 2 = 17

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we first need to calculate the total cost of the milk he purchased and then find the cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

The total cost of the milk purchased is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon: 
4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000.

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount of milk (4000 gallons) to determine the amount of sour milk:
2/5 * 4000 gallons = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons.

Now, we calculate the cost of the sour milk by multiplying the amount of sour milk by the cost per gallon:
1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received $5600 in refunds.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

We know that 100 books cost $500. To find the cost per book, we divide $500 by 100 books, which gives us $5 per book. 

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost per book ($5). 

Total number of books = $27000 / $5 = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5400 / 3 = 1800

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. So, at this point, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He then picks up the 5 apples, puts all but 1 in his pocket, and throws the remaining one at the tree. This means he now has 1 (initial apple) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.

The last apple he threw at the tree caused 6 more apples to fall. Newton then picks up all the remaining apples, which includes the 6 that fell and the 1 he threw (which didn't get put in his pocket). So, he now has the 5 apples in his pocket and the 7 apples he picked up (6 that fell plus the 1 he threw).

Therefore, Newton has a total of 5 (in his pocket) + 7 (he picked up) = 12 apples.

"To determine the cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of 50 kg bags of coal he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per unit.

First, we divide the total amount of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags:

850 kg / 50 kg = 17

Since Ali cannot order a fraction of a bag, and 850 kg is not exactly divisible by 50 kg, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough coal. However, in this case, 850 kg is exactly 17 bags.

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per unit ($18) to find the total cost:

17 bags * $18/bag = $306

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of cheese slices required is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Each friend also eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends, the total number of pepperoni slices required is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas required is 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both Jay's rate of building snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate of melting per hour, we can multiply the number of snowballs that melt per 15 minutes by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour). This gives us 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs that melt per hour.

Now, we can find Jay's net rate of building snowballs per hour by subtracting the rate of melting from the rate of building: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes Jay to build 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by his net rate of building: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and the Digimon anniversary marks 20 years since it came out, we can calculate John's age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

It is given that John was twice as old as Jim at that time. So, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4 years old

Now, we need to find Jim's current age. Since 20 years have passed, we add 20 to Jim's age at that time.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

Now, we need to add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, at the end of the second day, they had:
(x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages). So, at the end of the third day, they had:
(x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides, we get:
x = 19

"To determine the cost of May's haircut, we need to calculate the number of inches cut. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost would be $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to first calculate her total hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate. We also need to add the additional $10 she receives for each week of complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from her hourly rate is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for all 4 weeks, she receives an additional $10 for each week:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is the sum of her earnings from her hourly rate and the additional $10 for complete attendance:

Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * Amount of blood in a whale
Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Amount of blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * Amount of blood in a shark
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons

At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. So, the total number of people at this point is 50 (initial) + 40 (at 10:00) = 90.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80. So, the total number of people at this point is 90 (previous total) + 80 (new entrants) = 170.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so 3 times that number is 3 * 50 = 150. So, the total number of people at this point is 170 (previous total) + 150 (new entrants) = 320.

Total number of people: 320"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of packs of black pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens, and she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of pens. There are 5 packs of red pens, each containing 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is 5 * 5 = 25. There are 10 packs of black pens, each containing 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red pens and the black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75.

"To determine the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of trees planted on the first day and the number of trees planted on the second day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days by adding the number of trees planted on the first day and the number of trees planted on the second day: 60 + 80 = 140.

"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after the various incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there were 4 people in total. 

To find out how much root beer was available for each person, we divide the remaining amount of root beer (8 gallons) by the number of people (4).

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning, which is a fundamental tool in philosophical logic and critical thinking. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can represent this as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: 4x = 40 - 8, 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4, x = 8.

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes. 

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish to determine the number of fish with blue stripes.

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * Remaining fish
Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 42

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she initially had and then subtract the colors she lost and used.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which is 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors. So, the total number of colors she initially had is 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, Amy lost 4 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used from the total number of colors she initially had: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to determine the number of shells team Alphas and team The finders found.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells. 
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share would be 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. 
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, the remaining shells after team Alphas and team The finders found their share would be 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

Since there are only three teams, the remaining shells must be the ones team Gogetters found.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we can use the concept of averages. The average is calculated by summing up all the individual values and dividing by the number of values.

We know the average is 3 miles per day, and there are 4 dogs. So, the total miles walked by all dogs is the average multiplied by the number of dogs: 3 miles/day * 4 dogs = 12 miles/day.

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs: 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

To find the miles walked by the last dog, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school:

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount he owes is the sum of the borrowed amount and the interest.
Total amount = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the difference between the total amount and the amount paid in the first 11 months.
Amount paid in the twelfth month = Total amount - Total paid in 11 months
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying the base area by the height: 
Volume = base area * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches 

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is: 
Effective volume = 540 * 0.8 
Effective volume = 432 cubic inches 

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans by dividing the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 
Total jelly beans = Effective volume / volume of a jelly bean 
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 
Total jelly beans = 2880 

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is: 
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 864 

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true and estimated number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 
Difference = True number - Estimated number 
Difference = 900 - 864

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is:
3/4 * 40 = 30

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. The total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus after the third stop is:
90 * 2 = 180

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity:

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total pounds of meat = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

Total seasoning = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound

In 3 days, he travels 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100
= 60%

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48.

We also know that Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes eaten by Madeline, the grapes used by her brother, and the grapes used for the pies: 6 + 30 + 48 = 84.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers present = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
= 82 - 13 + 9

"To determine the total amount Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients per week. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. 
The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

The total cost per year is $10.00 (weekly cost) * 52 (weeks per year) = $520.00.

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms and then divide that by the total time available for cleaning.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. Therefore, the total time spent cleaning all classrooms is:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, we can calculate the total time spent cleaning per day:

1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

Now, we need to convert the 8-hour workday into minutes:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the time spent cleaning per day by the total time available and multiply by 100:

(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 50%

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we can calculate the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books she has (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she bought a total of 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so she will sell 60 eggs for 60 / 3 = 20 units of $1. The total revenue is 20 x $1 = $20.

Rose's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. Therefore, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate the number of red hats as follows:
Red hats = 100 * 1/2 = 50

Now, we need to find the number of remaining hats:
Remaining hats = 100 - 50 = 50

Since 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, we can calculate the number of blue hats as follows:
Blue hats = 50 * 3/5 = 30

Now, we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:
White hats = 50 - 30 = 20

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00
Discounted price = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the discounted price to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the discounted price by 100.

Discounted price in cents = $15.00 * 100
Discounted price in cents = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the discounted price in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

Cost per stick = Discounted price in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the required number of correct answers as follows:

110 * 0.7 = 77

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is:

70 * 0.6 = 42

Since she needs a total of 77 correct answers and she already has 42 from the first test, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as follows:

77 - 42 = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this relationship as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. This can be written as:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of blueberry cubes: 96"

"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make, we can break down the problem into steps based on the given historical averages.

First, we know that for every two customers who come into the dealership, one will buy a car. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he will need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, one customer comes into the dealership. To get 30 customers, Jason will need to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to break down the information provided.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms. 

Total flashlights = (1 flashlight/person * 4 people) + (2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms)
Total flashlights = 4 + 16
Total flashlights = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4.

Total small candles = 4 small candles/room * 4 rooms
Total small candles = 16

Total medium candles = 5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms
Total medium candles = 20

Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
Total candles = 16 + 20
Total candles = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles and flashlights.

Total candles and flashlights = Total candles + Total flashlights
Total candles and flashlights = 36 + 20
Total candles and flashlights = 56

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes John to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Since the sixth side is completed once the fifth side is done, we don't need to add any extra time for it.

The total time it takes John to complete the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. 

Let's denote the number of footballs as F, the number of helmets as H, and the number of robots as R. 

We are given that there are half as many helmets as footballs, so H = F/2. We are also given that there are 20 helmets, so H = 20. 

Substituting H = 20 into the equation H = F/2, we get 20 = F/2. Solving for F, we get F = 40.

We are also given that there are half as many robots as helmets, so R = H/2. Substituting H = 20 into this equation, we get R = 20/2 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total number of minutes he spends at work in a week is:
360 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1800 minutes/week

Now, let's divide the total number of minutes by the time it takes him to deal with a single call:

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs, we must calculate the water requirements for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's consider the 4 plants that need half a cup of water. Since there are 4 plants, we multiply 4 by 0.5 cups (half a cup) to get 2 cups.

Next, we consider the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. We multiply 8 by 1 cup to get 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left that need a quarter of a cup of water. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, 20 - 12 = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We multiply 8 by 0.25 cups (a quarter of a cup) to get 2 cups.

Finally, we add the water requirements for each group together: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Time on land = Distance / Speed
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance / Speed
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initially, the boat was worth $9000. After the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which means it lost 30% of its original value. The depreciation amount is 30% of $9000, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. This time, the depreciation is 30% of the value after the first year, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. The depreciation amount is 20% of the value after the second year, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the hotel stay is $80 per night for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel stay is 3 x $80 = $240.

The cost of each bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. To calculate 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1, which gives us $8 per bus ride. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 x $8 = $56.

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we must calculate the perimeter of his rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of their ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny. 

Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. 

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Now, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.

Number of good seashells = Total seashells - Number of cracked seashells

"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has five pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, John needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

"To determine how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the cost of the trays she bought.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 * $2 = $40.
She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 * $1 = $40.
Her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each, so the total cost of the trays is 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the cost of the trays from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck. 

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 * 2 = 10 children.

On the third street, each of the 10 children in the existing group is joined by 2 more children, resulting in a total of 10 * 3 = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of children.

Therefore, the total number of children now following the truck is 30 - 5 = 25.

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break it down into meditation and yoga time separately.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so her daily meditation time is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly meditation time is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, her total meditation time is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her weekly yoga time is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, her total yoga time is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total meditation and yoga time to get the overall time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

"To find Jackie's height before the summer, we need to first determine Anne's height and then Jackie's current height.

Since Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 * 36""
Anne's height = 72""

Now, we know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can calculate Jackie's current height as follows:

Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2""
Jackie's current height = 72"" - 2""
Jackie's current height = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before the summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height:

Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 67""

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To calculate the discount, we need to find 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16. 

The cost of the shoes is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since distance = speed * time, we can write the equation for Aaron's part of the race as 2 = A * 16. 

Substituting A = 2V into the equation, we get 2 = 2V * 16. Simplifying this equation, we get 2 = 32V. Solving for V, we get V = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can calculate the time it took her to complete her part of the race. Since distance = speed * time, we can write the equation for Vanessa's part of the race as 4 = V * t, where t is the time in minutes. 

Substituting V = 1/16 into the equation, we get 4 = (1/16) * t. Solving for t, we get t = 64 minutes.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.2.

$400 * 0.2 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic's labor costs $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours.

$50 * 3 = $150

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by dividing the second equation by 2 to simplify it:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
