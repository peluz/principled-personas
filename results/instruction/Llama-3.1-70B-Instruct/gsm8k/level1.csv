"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating 3 for breakfast and baking muffins with 4 eggs.

Total eggs laid per day = 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3
Eggs used for baking muffins = 4
Total eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7
Eggs left to sell = Total eggs laid per day - Total eggs used
Eggs left to sell = 16 - 7
Eggs left to sell = 9

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Janet makes by selling the eggs at the farmers' market.

Price per egg = $2
Eggs left to sell = 9
Total money made = Price per egg * Eggs left to sell
Total money made = $2 * 9
Total money made = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we can add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to find the total number of bolts.

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can set up an equation to find the new value after repairs:

New value = Original value + (150% of Original value)
New value = $80,000 + (150% of $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

But we know that the $50,000 in repairs increased the value of the house by $120,000. So the new value after repairs is $200,000.

However, we can also calculate the new value after repairs by adding the $50,000 in repairs to the original value and then multiplying by 2.5 (250% of the original value), but we must subtract the $50,000 in repairs from the result of the multiplication of 2.5 and the original value of the house, and then add the $50,000 in repairs.

New value = 2.5 * ($80,000) - $50,000 + $50,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single day and then multiply it by the number of days he runs in a week.

In a single day, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a single day is:
3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed required is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed required: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows:
- 1st glass: $5
- 2nd glass: $3
- 3rd glass: $5
- 4th glass: $3
- ...
- 15th glass: $5
- 16th glass: $3

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla already downloaded 80 GB before the restart, so she doesn't need to download that part again. But since she has to restart from the beginning, we can't subtract the 80 GB from the total. Instead, we add the time it took to download the 80 GB before the restart (40 minutes) to the time it took for the restart (20 minutes) and the time it takes to download the entire file (100 minutes).

The total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he was initially away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was away from home is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours:
- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.
- He spent the next half-hour (0.5 hours) driving at 30 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) driving at 80 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled during the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he traveled from the initial distance he was away from home:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Total Distance = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads in each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the number of downloads in each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to start earning money as 'x'. The total cost will be the initial cost plus the annual cost multiplied by the number of years: $90 + $3x.

The total revenue will be the annual revenue multiplied by the number of years: $10.50x.

To start earning money, the total revenue should be greater than the total cost. We can set up the inequality:

$10.50x > $90 + $3x

Subtracting $3x from both sides:

$7.50x > $90

Dividing both sides by $7.50:

x > 12

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest whole number greater than 12 is 13.

However, this is the point where the total revenue equals the total cost. To start earning money, we need the total revenue to be greater than the total cost. Therefore, it will take 13 years for the total revenue to equal the total cost, and 14 years for the total revenue to be greater than the total cost.

The final answer is: 14"

She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. 
So, she sold (1/2) * ((2x/3) - 2) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. 
Now, she has (2x/3) - 2 - (1/2) * ((2x/3) - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
(2x/3) - 2 - (1/2) * ((2x/3) - 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:
(2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5
Combine like terms:
(x/3) - 1 = 5
Add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6
Multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit: $125"

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

"To find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs in 28 days, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days: 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time she has left to complete the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

The total cost of the other items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. Let's represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We are also given that their total age now is 162. We can set up an equation based on this information:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 165 / 15 = 11 lego sets.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking and running speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. 

So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. 

So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time.

"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)

= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie

The total cost of one movie trip is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of the popcorn: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we divide Peter's total budget by the cost of one movie trip: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To find the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit. This will give us the maximum weight of boxes the truck can carry.

Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Maximum weight of boxes = Weight limit of the bridge - Weight of the driver and the empty truck
Maximum weight of boxes = 5000 - 3755
Maximum weight of boxes = 1245 pounds

Now, we need to divide the maximum weight of boxes by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Weight of each box = 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight of boxes / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount he paid. 

First, we calculate the 25% fee on the original bill of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee, the delivery fee, and the tip to the original bill.
$40.00 (original bill) + $10.00 (25% fee) = $50.00
$50.00 + $3.00 (delivery fee) = $53.00

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to determine the total percentage of the pension she is entitled to. 

Since she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, and she quits after 30 years, she has worked 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) at the 5% entitlement rate.

The total percentage of the pension she is entitled to is 10 years * 5% per year = 50%.

Since the full pension is $50,000 per year, Marcy's annual pension will be 50% of $50,000.

Annual pension = 50% * $50,000
Annual pension = 0.5 * $50,000
Annual pension = $25,000

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
Total amount for the first half of the year = $140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

Total miles = mpg * Total gallons in tank
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles = 300 miles

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

The puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, so the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food consumed in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. We can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is the absolute difference between the amount of laundry each of them does.

80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of plants she will give away is:
1 plant/window ledge * 40 window ledges = 40 plants

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can find the total number of doorbell rings by adding the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add the pages from all the textbooks. 

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography)
Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
Total pages = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total pages.

Remaining pages = Total pages - 15
Remaining pages = 39 - 15
Remaining pages = 24

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day to finish the remaining pages in 4 days.

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / 4
Average pages per day = 24 / 4
Average pages per day = 6

"To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass. Therefore, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week: 20 + 7 = 27.

Distance covered in 10 minutes = 3 miles
Total distance across the city = 42 miles

Time to cover the whole city = (Total distance / Distance covered in 10 minutes) * 10 minutes
Time to cover the whole city = (42 miles / 3 miles) * 10 minutes
Time to cover the whole city = 14 * 10 minutes
Time to cover the whole city = 140 minutes

Poppy places a quarter of the pieces, which is 1/4 * 1000 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 1/3 * 750 = 250 pieces.

The total number of pieces placed is 250 (by Poppy) + 250 (by her mom) = 500.

The number of pieces left to be placed is 1000 - 500 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height of each box.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = Inner length * Inner width * Inner height
Inner volume = 3 * 4 * 2
Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 3 * 24
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, the number of cookies he intended to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the initial cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

Initial cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Initial cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Initial cost of gas = $30.00

Cashback amount = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Cashback amount = $0.20 * 10
Cashback amount = $2.00

Total cost after cashback = Initial cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

Total roll-ups eaten: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by the number of people (2):
Average roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we find the rate at which Julia rows: 
Distance = 20 feet, Time = 16 seconds
Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we find the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore:
Time to reach shore = 64 seconds
Distance = Rate * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on:
Water taken on = (Distance / 10) * 2 liters = (80 feet / 10) * 2 liters = 16 liters

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to first find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

Now, we can solve for 'x':
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost price
Profit = $270 - $180
Profit = $90

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar, which is 7/20.

 Multiply the total number of teaspoons and cups (120) by the fraction of sugar (7/20):

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = x + (0.3 * x)
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume her salary also increased by some percentage. However, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase for Lylah. We can assume the same percentage increase for Lylah as Adrien, which is 40%.

New Lylah's salary = Old Lylah's salary + (40% of old Lylah's salary)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New Lylah's salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New Lylah's salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons she had left was x + 5 - 3 = x + 2.

We are given that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought was 10.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W. We know that W = 4Q, so W = 4(100) = 400.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he spends playing video games in a week and multiply it by his hourly wage.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he spends playing video games in a week is:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working is:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

Total cost of non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Applying 10% tax to non-food items:
Tax amount: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1
Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Total cost of all items: $5 (food) + $11 (non-food) = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we first need to find his total expenses. He has 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential) and each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.

The cost of bleach for each client is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of cloths for each client is $5.
The total cost for each client is $4 + $5 = $9.
The total cost for 8 clients is 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income is $92, and his total expenses are $72. 
Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so Kim's profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 12/3 = 4 harvests in a year.

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours left the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned yet is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) - 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's start with the information that the ants left 5 fries behind after they carried off 1. This means there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants took one.

Before the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, there were 6 * 3/1 = 18 fries (since 2/3 of the fries were stolen, 1/3 of the fries remained, so we multiply 6 by 3 to get the original amount).

Before the pigeons ate 3 fries each, there were 18 + 3 * 3 = 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Before the seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries (since Dave ate 14 fries, half of that is 7).

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 34 + 14 = 48.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so the total hours for these days are:
2 classes/day * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours

Total hours per week = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester are:

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * number of white carnations
= 4 * 40
= 160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From statement 2, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years. Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has their first runner running in 60 seconds, the second runner in 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner in 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner in 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time taken by the faster team from the total time taken by the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities of each roll.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

To find the difference in probabilities, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked and add that to the number of apples her mom picked.

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20) to get the total number of apples picked.

Total apples = 10 (Jenna) + 20 (mom) = 30

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The total profit is $400, which is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost.

Total selling price = $30x
Total cost = $22x

Total profit = Total selling price - Total cost
$400 = $30x - $22x
$400 = $8x

Now, we can solve for 'x':

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3.
$102 / 3 = $34.

Total insects per week = 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total amount of insects per week by 7 to find the amount per day.

Insects per day = 35 / 7 = 5 pounds

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net gain in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total number of trees Tom has is:
50 (initial trees) + 8 * 10 (net gain per year for 10 years) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130:
30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees

So, the number of trees Tom has left is:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Friday morning.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back on the lawn. So, on Saturday morning, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos became 12 + 18 = 30. The number of white flamingos remained the same, 6.

At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

However, since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise for the entire year. The 5% raise is calculated as:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His total earnings after the raise would be:

We know Brinley's scores for the first 5 tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the total score of these 5 tests, we add them up: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

However, we need to remove the lowest score, which is 71. So, the total score after removing the lowest score is:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score for the 5 tests, including the new test score, to achieve an average of 93. We already calculated this as 465.

Since we have a total score of 367 from the first 5 tests (excluding the lowest score), we subtract this from the required total score:

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first find the number of petunias he plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums = 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and add it to the amount spent in the first year.

The amount spent in the first year is $15000. 
The amount spent in the second year is one-third of the amount spent in the first year, which is (1/3) * 15000 = 5000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is 15000 + 5000 = 20000.

"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so the total cost for Carlos is:
$30/hour * 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so the total cost for Benji is:
$18/hour * 5 hours = $90

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.

Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Total number of cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
(Water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Adding extra meat costs $2.00, so the total is $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50.
Adding extra cheese costs $1.00, so the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50.
Adding avocado costs $1.00, so the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50.
Adding 2 sauces costs 2 * $0.25 = $0.50, so the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.
Upgrading the meal costs $3.00, so the total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to first find their combined rate of adding pieces per minute. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her mom can add 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute) to find the total time in minutes: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

"To find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of watermelons that were ready and subtract that from the total.

Initially, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons.

Now, we subtract the total number of watermelons harvested from the initial number to find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.
120 - 36 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of the cost of the cars, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to determine the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants.

Given that there are 50 ants and the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = (1/2) * Number of ants
= (1/2) * 50

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins
Another one-third went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Now, subtract the total penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his total weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. 

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

However, we also know that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so their combined weekly consumption is 42 * 3 = 126 tomatoes per week (42 for Steve and 42 / 2 = 21 for his girlfriend).

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week.

Number of vines needed = Total weekly consumption / Tomatoes per vine per week
= 126 / 3
= 42

So, Steve needs 42 vines to meet their combined weekly consumption."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to determine the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices per pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he creates by mixing the ink.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen.

From the initial 25 pens, he can create:
25 / 5 = 5 new pens (using the ink from the first 25 pens)

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

The 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually, and he can mix their ink to create 1 more pen:
5 / 5 = 1 new pen

Now, he has 30 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we first need to determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2 * Robert's candies = 54

Divide both sides by 2 to find Robert's candies:

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James' candies can be calculated as:

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora.

Dolly has 2 books and reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book and reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Since they both read a total of 3 books each, the collective number of books read is 3 + 3 = 6.

However, this counts each book twice (once for each person), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the actual number of unique books read.

But in this case, we are counting the number of times a book is read, not the number of unique books. So the correct answer is the total number of times a book is read.

"To find the total time Mike spends writing, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters per week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages exchanged is 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes 60 pages per week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing in a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time Mike spends writing in a week is 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used are:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin was left with:
19 - 10 = 9

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, Griffin was left with:
(9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
7 + x = 27

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The equation is: 28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is:

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

"To find the total time, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
2. Time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 
   Since it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.
   40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   Time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes
3. Total time to warm the oil = 20 + 28 = 48 minutes
4. Time to cook the chicken: 
   It takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm the oil, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total warming time.
   Time to cook the chicken = 48 - 5 = 43 minutes
5. Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken = Total time to warm the oil + Time to cook the chicken
   Total time = 48 + 43 = 91 minutes

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches. 
Collar stitches = 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. 
Rosette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves.
Total stitches for sleeves = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the stitches for each sleeve.
Stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the song, then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we can add the number of lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. So, we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Sam is currently 6 years old.

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, we can calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance as follows:

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) - Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) - Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) - Page 32 (front)

Notice that each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper. Since there are 16 pairs of pages, we need 16 pieces of paper to print all 32 pages.

However, when the paper is folded, the front and back of each page are paired, but the pages are not printed on separate pieces of paper. Instead, each piece of paper has two pages printed on it, one on the front and one on the back.

Therefore, to print 32 pages, we need 16 pieces of paper, but since each piece of paper has two pages printed on it, we can print 32 pages with just 8 pieces of paper, with 4 pages on each piece of paper (2 on the front and 2 on the back), folded in half to create the 8 pages.

But, if we consider the folding of the paper, we can see that we can print 8 pages on one piece of paper (page 1 and 8 on the outside, page 2 and 7 on the next fold, page 3 and 6 on the next fold, and page 4 and 5 on the inside). 

So, to print 32 pages, we need 4 pieces of paper.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount Theo has left after subtracting his total expenses from his total budget: 
Amount left = Total budget - Total expenses
Amount left = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

Finally, let's calculate the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners by subtracting the amount he wishes to save from the amount left: 
Amount to spend on gifts = Amount left - Amount to save
Amount to spend on gifts = $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so their total consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day, so their total consumption is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total daily egg consumption of the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can write an equation using the total number of players:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + 2D)/2 + D/2 = 105
(6D)/2 = 105
3D = 105

Divide both sides by 3:
D = 35

The number of players on the defense is 35."
"To find the total number of people who were initially invited, we need to calculate the number of people from each type of family and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people initially invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, we need to subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments.
8 people couldn't come due to illness.
1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 * 1/4 = 2 people.
The total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10 people.

The number of people who show up for Martha's party is 24 - 10 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Number of boys = 30

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys,

= 3 * 30
= 90

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys,
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's set up a proportion to represent the situation:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To find the number of women left, we first need to find the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils she has. 
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in boxes.

Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils in boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.
24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils. We add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have.
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Finally, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold to find out how many boxes are needed.

"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To find the total number of old records, we need to determine how many new records each person received on average, then use the trade ratio to find the number of old records.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can find the average number of new records per person by dividing the total number of new records by the number of people:
7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to find the average number of old records per person:
1.4 new records per person * 2 old records per new record = 2.8 old records per person

Now, we can multiply the average number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records:
2.8 old records per person * 5 people = 14 old records

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names. Assuming RJ and Richard are the same person, we will consider Richard as having 1 gun (RJ) or 5 guns. We will calculate for both scenarios.

Scenario 1: Considering Richard as having 1 gun (RJ)
Total guns = 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard) + 5 (this is not considered as it is assumed to be an error)
Total guns = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19 guns
Number of people = 4
Guns per person = Total guns / Number of people = 19 / 4 = 4.75

Scenario 2: Considering Richard as having 5 guns
Total guns = 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard)
Total guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Daily earnings when making silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we can calculate the increase in daily earnings: 
Increase = $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original amount and multiply by 100:
Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses first. 

The monthly cost of food is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is 25 * 4 = $100.

The monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

So, the total monthly expenses are $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the yearly expenses, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year): $220 * 12 = $2640.

"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours
- Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number of plant pots she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. For the roses, they need twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had.

Andrea initially had $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21.

The amount Andrea saved is $21."
"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent, so we can set up the equation:

15 = 0.3x

To find the total time x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time John spent is 50 hours.

Since he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time by 0.4:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract that from the cost of the phone, taking into account the money she already has.

Annabelle's earnings from her first job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200
Annabelle's earnings from her second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75
Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275
Total savings: $275 (earnings) + $80 (initial savings) = $355

Now, let's subtract the total savings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more Annabelle needs to save:
$400 (phone cost) - $355 (total savings) = $45

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree and then the combined height of the two shorter trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. 
The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so its height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the toys he bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money he had, then add the extra money his mother gave him.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person and then divide the total budget by that cost.

The cost per person includes:
- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- $5 in arcade tokens
- 2 go-kart rides: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Since Morgan also needs to be included, we'll subtract her cost from the total budget first:
$90 - $30 = $60

Now, we'll divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"To find out how much Marisa saves each day, we need to calculate the cost of the lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. 
She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1.

The change she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is $4 * 5 = $20.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:

45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

The son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train needs to travel before service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Number of days = 18,000 / 900 = 20

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 pounds = 8 pounds.
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 pounds = 15 pounds.

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then add them together.

For the trip to his friend's house, the total distance is 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles. The speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

For the trip back home, the distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken back home
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to first find the total number of boys. 

Total number of students = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Since 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday, the number of boys present on Friday is:
Number of boys present on Friday = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present on Friday = 53 - 4
Number of boys present on Friday = 49

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 
Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.
Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we multiply 3 by 4 and subtract 5 to get the number of shoplifters:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We are then told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we multiply 7 by 3 to get the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:

3 * 7 = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we add up the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence, and subtract this total from 50:

3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

50 (total) - 31 = 19

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Since Sara scored 8 points, three times more than Sara's points would be 3 * 8 = 24. However, this is three times Sara's points, not the total points Erin has now. We know Erin scored 14 points, so to find the total points Erin has now, we subtract 14 from the three times Sara's points: 24 - 14 = 10 is incorrect, we should add 14 to the three times Sara's points - 8, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

The cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost, which is 0.2 * $880 = $176.

The total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

The cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

To find the number of officers, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of seniors: 1/4 * 44 = 11.

The cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from the first half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from the second half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total milk collected every day is the sum of the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as:

Number of apples on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday:
Number of apples on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
Total apples = Apples on Monday + Apples on Tuesday + Apples on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, she also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for 5 months, it's (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time 
= $3,650 * 4.17% 
= $3,650 * 0.0417 
= $152.055 

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
= $3,650 + $152.055 
= $3,802.055 

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5 months: 
Monthly payment = $3,802.055 / 5 
= $760.411 

Rounded to two decimal places, the monthly payment is approximately $760.41.

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km
Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances they hiked to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make with 3 pitchers: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be:
$36 - $18 = $18

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. She sells 4 cups per hour, so:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Finally, we can calculate her profit per hour:
$18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we can set up an equation using the given ratio. Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is x. 

The number of popsicles Betty has is 5x, and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. The total number of popsicles they have together is 5x + 6x = 11x.

We are given that the total number of popsicles is 165, so we can set up the equation 11x = 165.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: x = 165 / 11 = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount. 

The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The 20% discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spent half that time recording it, so she spent 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording.

She spent 90 minutes editing.

The total time she spent is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

Now, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

Energy used per day = Power * Time 
Since the power is given in watts, we'll keep the time in hours to get the energy in watt-hours (Wh). 
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh

Now, we'll convert this to kilowatt-hours (kWh) by dividing by 1000 (since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).
Energy used per day = 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

If Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, the new time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours. 
New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh
New energy used per day = 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day
Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

Now, we'll calculate the energy saved in 30 days.
Energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh * 30

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total amount Sally spent is $4.5 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The cost of the first package is $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, the total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to find out how many cookies she needs in total for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/recipe = 5 recipes

Since each recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we can say that Shannon needs 5 dozens of cookies.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50000
= 0.01 * 50000
= 500

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that will explode) have this defect.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of the candles that will explode
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = 4 * $14 
= $56

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average).

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation:

(30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine like terms:

145 + x = 500

Subtract 145 from both sides:

x = 355

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 355.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given:

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
2. Distance traveled over the next 2 days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
3. Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (since he wasn't traveling)
4. Distance traveled in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion to find Zack's locker size.

Let's denote Zack's locker size as Z. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z

To find Z, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up another proportion:

20 = (1/2)T

where T is Timothy's locker size. To find T, we can multiply both sides by 2:

T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from both banks.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we are calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months to get the correct number of months at the normal rate. However, in this case, the normal rate period is given as 8 months, so we use that directly. The cost is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is the remaining 10 months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10) at $14 per month, so the cost is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

The total cost is the sum of these three parts:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original prices of both jeans and the amount saved from each.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.

The rest of the savings, which is 2/3 * $6 = $4, is from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but since the jogger jeans cost less, we need to find the difference in the other direction, which is $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is actually the difference

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them up.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150 in total.

Now, we know that Kenny sold his cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he sold, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price of each card ($1.5):

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards Kenny sold, not the number he started with. We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We already know that Kenny sold 100 cards, so we can set up the equation:

2/3x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs that were not available is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog was missing one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of: 
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: 
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew in sequence.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips and then determine how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:
3 * 0.40 = 1.20 dollars

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he spent is:
5 - (5 * 0.01) = 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars:
4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 dollars

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:
3.75 / 0.75 = 5

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first find the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total.

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, they ate 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces of cake.

Now, to find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake:

20 - 5 = 15

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8). 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then subtract the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, and add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before him.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and it takes Bernadette four times as long, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Now, we subtract the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater (4 minutes) from the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater (16 minutes), and add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before him: 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: Width = Area / Length.

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees, so after the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after the oven is on:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Final temperature: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
- James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 
- James' swim time = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
- James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. 
So, James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes 
- James' total time = 170 + 10 
- James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' time for the run: 
- James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time) 
- James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85) 
- James' run time = 180 - 121 
- James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we first convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay it eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 1/2 bail per mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The total cost of the sneakers is $576.

On Monday, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The number of sneakers left is:
48 - 17 = 31

The rest of the sneakers were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the rest of the week:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option and the regular ticket option.

The super ticket option costs $20 for the ticket and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda, so the total cost is $21.

The regular ticket option costs $12 for the ticket, $3 for the soda, and an unknown price (x) for the popcorn. The total cost for this option is $12 + $3 + x = $15 + x.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $2 less than the super ticket option. So, we can set up the equation:

$15 + x = $21 - $2
$15 + x = $19

Now, we can solve for x:

x = $19 - $15
x = $4

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total Cost = 160 * 12

"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is the sum of the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, minus the number of kids allergic to both.

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Total number of kids in the class = 32
Number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 12

Number of kids who aren't allergic to anything = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, then add them together.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is:
3 * 200 = 600

Each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is:
3 * 7 = 21

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides:
600 + 21 = 621

Total number of people going on the tour: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the additional cost. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel cost: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has three times as many, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs and can store up to 100 songs. So, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. He can store up to 100 songs, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can divide the total miles he runs a week by his speed to find the total hours he runs a week:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are needed to feed the horses for 5 days. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 

To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Since the child saves $2 daily, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days:
$8 (remaining amount) / $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost is:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine her age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
= 3 * 14
= 42 years

Since this is Angela's age in four years, to find her current age, we need to subtract 4 years from this value:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4

However, this is not the correct answer because the question states that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, not that Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years. So, we need to subtract 4 years from Brett's age to find his age in four years and then multiply it by 3 to find Angela's age in four years.

Brett's age in four years = 14 + 4 = 18 years

However, the question states that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, not in four years. So we need to subtract 4 years from Angela's age in four years to find her current age.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for 'x':

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Number of guests: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation L + B/2 + B = 43, we get (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

Width of rug = Width of chair + 5
Width of rug = 3 + 5
Width of rug = 8

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as follows:

Length of couch = 2 * Width of rug + 2
Length of couch = 2 * 8 + 2
Length of couch = 16 + 2

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the most cost-effective option for him.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 66.67 sticks per dollar is more than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the more cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

Since he can get 400 sticks from one 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get:

400 sticks * 4 = 1600 sticks

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer = Total cost
$1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants on the left side:

Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April). Both halves have 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. In the second half, he wants to save twice as much, so he will save 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month can be represented as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half, and 2x dollars per day in the second half, we can find the daily savings for the second half:
2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

Cost of apples: 3 apples * $1.50 = $4.50
Cost of oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80 = $4.00
Cost of peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost of fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is the difference between $20 and the total cost of the fruits.

Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will receive for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he will get:
20 * $0.8 = $16

Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she will get:
20 * $0.5 = $10

Now, let's find the difference between the amount Jairus and Jenny will receive:
$16 - $10 = $6

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

"To find the total miles walked by Jeff, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Distance to work = 3 miles
Since he walks to and back, the total miles walked per day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Number of days he works in a week = 5 days
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the steps:

1. She writes the alphabet in full twice: The alphabet has 26 letters. Writing it twice means 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of it once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

Now, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial full alphabets) + 13 (half alphabet) + 65 (re-written letters) = 130 letters.

Total number of letters Elise has written: 130"

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
The discount amount is 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, each with 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 * 24 = 48.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this, we get 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we will assume the time for a warm day is the same as for a hot day, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 20 - 4 = 16.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight of the three friends by adding their weights and dividing by 3.

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying her total reading time by her reading rate: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 105 * 4/3 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give an actual temperature of 520, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature is 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:

Price of 1 box after discount = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Price of 2 boxes after discount = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:
Cost of each pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Total number of contacts
= $180.00 / 180
= $1.00

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit, which is 100 ml. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

From the given information, we know:
1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. R + B + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the expressions for R and G from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3), we get:
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
B = 1500

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is the absolute difference between the weight loss and weight gain:

100 (initial invitees) + 2 * 100 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone calls is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone calls to get the total number of seats needed:

"To find the total cost of the boots on Amazon, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 
Total cost on Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4
Total cost on Amazon = $20

To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, we multiply the shipping cost on Amazon by 2.
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4
Shipping cost on eBay = $8
Total cost on eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8
Total cost on eBay = $21

"To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day.

Day 1: 4 feet (initial height)
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk needs to be at least 20 + 1 = 21 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than the window.

However, we can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk is 16 feet tall, which is still shorter than the window. Therefore, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, but it actually surpasses the window's height on the 4th day, so the answer is 4 - 1 = 3 days for it to be the same height and 4 days to be taller.

However, the question asks for the number of days to be taller than the window, so the answer is 4.

"To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we need to first find the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms is 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the amount of protein he gets per day is 200 grams * 0.03 grams of protein per gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the amount of protein John gets per week is 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle, which is 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he will make:
60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes:

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings per 2 pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps / 120 washings * (1 pump / 1 washing) * 120 washings 
Total number of pumps = 120 * 2 = 240 pumps

Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining days, then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, so the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. The total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total number of cars towed:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
48 (required height) - 40 (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take him to reach the required height:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

"To find James' commission, we first need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, so:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, so:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

1. Base price: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: 1/3 of the king cab upgrade = (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not given, so we will assume it is not included in the calculation.

Now, let's add the costs of all the features to the base price:

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of $20,000 and add it to his original salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Since the bonus is worth half a month's salary, the bonus amount is:
$21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

However, the bonus is not a recurring monthly payment, so we should calculate the total yearly income by multiplying the new monthly salary by 12 and then adding the bonus.

Total yearly income = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total yearly income = $252,000 + $10,500

400 = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
Sales from green hats = 400 * 2
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month:
Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats

The total cost of the candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days in the first 30 days. Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.

We know that her first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days plus the next 3 days is 12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14.

However, we are interested in the number of good days left in the month after the first 30 days. Since we already know the total number of good days in the first 30 days (12), we subtract the initial 8 good days from the first 30 days and add the 2 additional good days from the next 3 days.

So, the number of good days left in the month is 12 (initial good days) - 8 (good days in the first 8 days) + 2 (additional good days) = 6.

However, this is not correct since we are not removing the good days from the first 30 days but rather adding the next 3 days to the 30 days. The correct way to solve this is to subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days in 33 days. 

The total good days in 33 days is 12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14. The good days left in the month is 14 (total good days) - 12 (good days in the first 30 days) = 2.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 
2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2:
2x / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the current height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to calculate the number of dogs he has to provide toys for.

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs doubled from 12 to 2 * 12 = 24.

However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone. So, the total number of dogs now is 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys."
"To find Skyler's investment, we need to calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances first.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked in 2 days = 2 days * 3 hours/day
Total hours worked in 2 days = 6 hours

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
Total earnings = 6 hours * $20
Total earnings = $120

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load to determine by how much they exceeded the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 150% of the original length, or 1.5x. 

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, the time taken for this part is half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, the time taken for this part is half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for both modes: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of all four children is:

T + T + t + t + t = 44

Combine like terms:

2T + 3t = 44

Substitute T = t + 7 into the equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expand and simplify:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, we can find the cost of 4 candies by subtracting the cost of 5 lollipops from $3.20. 

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This is the cost of 4 candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide $1.20 by 4.

$1.20 / 4 = $0.30

Now we know the cost of one candy is $0.30. We can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one lollipop and one candy by 10 and adding them together.

10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's savings as follows:
Neil's savings = Rong's savings + (2/5 * Rong's savings)
Neil's savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20)
Neil's savings = 20 + (4 * 4)
Neil's savings = 20 + 8
Neil's savings = 28

Now, we need to calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong's total savings = Rong's savings per month * 120
Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
Rong's total savings = 2400

Neil's total savings = Neil's savings per month * 120
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
Neil's total savings = 3360

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The two vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines are 40% of the total bill (since 100% - 60% = 40%). 

Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, 40% of 'x' is $40. We can set up the equation:

0.4x = 40

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 40 / 0.4
x = 100

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6

Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Total chairs currently available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs required. There are 42 adults and 15 babies. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Total high chairs required = 15 (given that there are already 8 high chairs, Mia needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs)
Total regular chairs required = 42 (given that there are already 40 regular chairs, Mia needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs)

Total chairs Mia needs to get = 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them has left.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 4 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. So, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. So, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Now, let's find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger. Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces. The difference is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can calculate the area as follows:

Area to be covered = (2/3) * 36 sq ft
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. To find the total number of tiles needed, we can multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

Total tiles needed = Area to be covered * Tiles per square foot
Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft
Total tiles needed = 576 tiles

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5 times the number of pounds picked, which is 30. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is the cost per pound of $2.5 times the number of pounds, which is 30.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to calculate the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can find the new price by calculating 10% of $700 and adding it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price = Original price + Price increase
New price = $700 + $70
New price = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price by the number of computers.

Total amount = New price * Number of computers
Total amount = $770 * 500
Total amount = $385,000

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, the total taps in this case is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total taps in this case is 400 * 2 = 800.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find the total number of slices left, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

The total number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so the dog takes (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the average time by adding the cat's time and the dog's time, then dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

"To find the total number of s'mores needed, we need to calculate the number of s'mores for the kids and the adults separately and then add them together.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores
Total s'mores needed: 18 s'mores + 6 s'mores = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a box, and we need exactly 3 sleeves, we can conclude that we need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages:

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidates A and B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidates A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for a total count. 29 large buttons is worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding this to the 60 small buttons she has, she has a total of 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the small buttons to the equivalent number of large and small buttons. We already know she has 29 large buttons. The remaining small buttons are 147 - 87 = 60. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the 60 small buttons are worth 60 / 3 = 20 large buttons. However, we are asked for the total number of buttons, so we should not convert the 60 small buttons to large buttons. Instead, we should just add the 29 large buttons and the 60 small buttons.

The total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons. However, the question does not specify whether it wants the total number of buttons in terms of large buttons or small buttons. To provide a single numerical answer, we will provide the total number of buttons in terms of small buttons. We already calculated this above: 147.

"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to work backwards from the given information.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3.

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion.

Let x be the total number of puppies. Then, two thirds of x is equal to 18.

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we add 90 to the number of bananas.
Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Time spent driving to the museum = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is:

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 * 4.5
Distance driven = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can find the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 * 1.5
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Then Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.
Points from berries for Emma = 5y
Points from berries for Ava = 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 't' seconds left on the timer. Then Ava finishes the level with 't - 4' seconds left.
Points from time for Emma = 30t

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but we are given that two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so the cost is 30 dollars for two pizzas, or 15 dollars each for two pizzas, or 2 x 15 = 30 dollars for two pizzas). 

However, the two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so the cost is 30 dollars for two pizzas, or 15 dollars each for two pizzas, or 2 x 15 = 30 dollars for two pizzas. 

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. 

The cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write another equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide by 3:

One-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs sold are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 
So, we convert 1/4 to 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2) and keep 1/8 as it is.

Now, we add the fractions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

This means 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart TVs or analog TVs. 
To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we subtract 3/8 from 1 (the total fraction of all TVs).

1 can be written as 8/8. 
So, 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.

Now, we know that 5/8 of the total TVs sold are OLED TVs. 
Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying 5/8 by 40.

Discount = 25% of $40
= 0.25 * $40
= $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $10
= $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find the amount of money he will have left over.

Amount left over = $50 - $30
= $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we need to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:
$1,040,000 per month * 3 months
= $3,120,000

Total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months: $3,120,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and add them together.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, so the total time for this song is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and will be sung once, so the total time for this song is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. 
Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted: 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all stuffed animals. This means the number of stuffed goats (x) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x).

We can set up the equation as follows:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

To solve for x, we can distribute 0.3 to 14 and x:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference between the distance traveled by the second car and the distance traveled by the first car:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, the total number of chips is:

2 * 72 = 144

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can find the total area Milo can cover with the chips by dividing the total number of chips by 12:

144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Now, we add the remaining tea to the total amount of tea consumed:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to find the total time it would take all of them to cross the highway. However, since they are traveling at the same speed and crossing the same distance, the time it takes for one turtle is the same as the time it takes for all four turtles.

Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each of them made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the reduced price of the laptop.

The reduced price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she has from her job and her mom ($230) from the total amount she has ($350) to find out how much she has in her purse: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to determine how many liters of milk his current cows produce. 

Since the farmer has 3 cows and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the total milk produced is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the liters per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and then subtract that from the total length of the three glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. Since the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the length used is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. The length used is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. The length used is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

The total length used is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2:

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, the number of socks Peter has is:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = Number of socks Jack has + Number of socks Peter has
= 30 + 60
= 90

Total number of dishes = Number of dishes Jack has + Number of dishes Peter has
= 60 + 30
= 90

Total number of socks and dishes = Total number of socks + Total number of dishes
= 90 + 90
= 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Let's start by finding the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know that there are 20 students in total, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. 

The number of students good at both subjects can be found by subtracting the students who are good at math only and English only from the total number of students:
20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:
5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is (3/4) * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:
$300 (original amount) + $675 (total interest) = $975

= 20

Now, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the remaining floral shirts will not have buttons.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, let's find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars

55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 new homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total is the sum of the homes built in the first two years (48) and the homes built in the third year (96), which is 48 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Given that I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

Given that I am 2 years older than my sister, we can express this as:
A = S + 2

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. 
Since A = B - 3 and A = S + 2, we can express S as S = A - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5.

Now, substitute A and S in the last equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:

"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we first need to find the total number of glasses the boys sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. 

Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2. 
18 / 2 = 9 glasses per boy.

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.

"To find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we can add the cost of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa.

Total cost = $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope:
Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total profit = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total profit = 20 * 2
Total profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. Since we don't know the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters).
Length of the new rope = 20 meters
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over:
Money left over = Total profit - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = 40 - 30
Money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can set up the equation:

Melanie's current age + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

Melanie's current age = 8

Now, we need to find when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's say x is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. We can set up the equation:

Melanie's current age + x = 3 * Melanie's current age

Substituting Melanie's current age as 8, we get:

8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 16

However, this is the total number of years from now. Since we want to know the number of years from now, not from her current age, and we already know that in 10 years she will be 18, we can subtract 10 from 16 and then add the 10 years that have already passed to get the correct number of years from now, but in this case, we just subtract 10 from 16 and then add 10 - 10 = 0 years that have passed, so we just subtract 10 from 16.

x = 16 - 10 + 0 
x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of one pack of apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert (excluding the encore) is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, he counts 2/3rd of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba, we will assume that they paid the same amount per mow as Joe. 

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
6 (from Joe) + 6 * 3x (from Kamala) + 6 * 5x (from Alba)
= 6 + 18x + 30x
= 6 + 48x

However, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she made 6 + 48x from mowing lawns. Let's denote the amount she made from lemonade sales as 'y'. 

We can set up the equation:
y + 6 + 48x = 80

Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to eliminate it. We can do this by using the information that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. This means that x = 1 (since Joe paid $6 for one mow).

Now we can substitute x = 1 into the equation:
y + 6 + 48(1) = 80
y + 6 + 48 = 80
y + 54 = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + 10
Distance rowed by Anis = 60 miles

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to calculate the amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $150 his parents gave him.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. 
He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. 
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. 
He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

In total, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left for a movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket will cost $10, which is exactly what he has left. Therefore, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has (1/3) * 600 = 200 calories.

Now, let's find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A mini blueberry muffin has (1/3) * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins. 
Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls = 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories
Total calories of mini blueberry muffins = 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories

Now, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories of the pastries.
Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total number of Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference.

Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
= 300 miles - 240 miles

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute L from equation (2) into equation (3):
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P and L from the above equations into equation (1):
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know L and J, we can find P:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Maria's friends initially received 2 water balloons each, and there are 4 friends. So, the initial number of balloons for her friends is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. 

So, the total initial number of balloons is 8 (friends) + 1 (Maria) = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria). So, the additional number of balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of balloons is the sum of the initial and additional balloons: 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

Since they can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the price per widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43200 * 6 = $259200

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so the cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * (amount each goat needs) - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total amount for goats = Number of goats * Amount each goat needs
Total amount for goats = 15 * 5
Total amount for goats = 75 pounds

Total amount for sheep = Number of sheep * Amount each sheep needs
Total amount for sheep = 12 * 7
Total amount for sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = Total amount for goats + Total amount for sheep
Total amount of hay needed = 75 + 84

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Distance traveled in the northerly direction for the second leg = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the third leg = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance traveled in the northerly direction = 36 miles

Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = Total distance traveled in the southerly direction - Total distance traveled in the northerly direction
Net distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones she received from her office, and the ones her friends had at the surprise party.

Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies.
Brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75. 
0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: 
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut, the time is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
For the 5 racquets with polyester string, the time is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
For the 4 racquets with hybrid sets, the time is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each phone. 

The first 2 phones are at full price, so the cost is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones (for the 2 kids) are half price, so the cost is 2 * ($600 / 2) = $600.

The total cost is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find the total number of oranges she had, then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and the number she kept.

Total number of oranges = 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

Number of oranges given away = 2 boxes * 2 people * 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges

Number of oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

Total number of oranges sold = Total number of oranges - Number of oranges given away - Number of oranges kept
= 240 - 80 - 60
= 100 oranges

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate India's number of states as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25
India's number of states: 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Since Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries.

Jerry has 60 - 30 (Robert) - 20 (Richard) = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

Robert has 30 - 10 (Jerry) = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days and then multiply them by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10 + 15 = 25.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective costs:
25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

The total amount earned is $150 + $390 = $540.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is 4 ounces.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100
= 0.4 * $100
= $40

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car
= $100 - $40

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (5 years before Emil turns 24).

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old (5 years before Emil turns 24).

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. 
The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total pounds of crawfish Joe caught is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players.
Number of football players = 20% of 30
= 0.20 * 30
= 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players.
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
Number of cheerleaders and band members = 25% of 24

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
= 5 * 5
= 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
= (25 + 5) / 2
= 30 / 2

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 111 feet to inches as follows:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant is:

12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant to find out how many plants Pat needs:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

45 plants - 17 plants = 28 plants

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend:

28 plants * $6/plant = $168

The cost of the petunias for each basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. Since there are 5 baskets, the total cost of the petunias is 5 * $9.00 = $45.00.

The cost of the sweet potato vines for each basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00. Since there are 5 baskets, the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the 5 hanging baskets is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck, which is:
$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. 

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes as x. Since the second plane's trips are half of the first plane's trips, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day. 

We know that 3/4 of these flights go to Greece, and the remaining 1/4 is split equally between France and Germany. 

The number of flights that do not go to Greece is 1/4 of 88:

88 * 1/4 = 22

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is half of 22:

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of all three howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W' and the age of Helene as 'H'. We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, we can write the equation:

H = 2 * (Total age / 4)
H = 2 * (20 / 4)
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the first equation:

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices is 4x (for kids) + 2(2x) (for adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total number of slices represents the whole watermelon, we can set up a proportion to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:

Adult's slice / Total slices = Percentage of watermelon
2x / 8x = Percentage of watermelon

To find the percentage, we can divide 2x by 8x and multiply by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost per student, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost for 12 sessions in a month is $40 * 12 = $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, not the cost. Since the question does not provide information about the revenue or the price per session for the students, we will assume the cost is the amount the dance studio earns from the students.

"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of babies born in a year is the number of female porcupines multiplied by the number of babies born per female porcupine in a year. 

Total number of babies born in a year = 30 * 48 = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year is the sum of the initial population and the total number of babies born in a year.

Total number of porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 yellow sticks

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
9 (red sticks) + 14 (blue sticks) + 11 (yellow sticks) = 34

"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the number of laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps:
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons
Total water pumped: 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is:
18000 - 12000 = 6000

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end was 28%, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Charge after 3 hours = Charge before 3 hours * (1 - 0.07)^3
0.28 = Charge before 3 hours * (0.93)^3

Now, we can solve for the charge before 3 hours:
Charge before 3 hours = 0.28 / (0.93)^3
Charge before 3 hours ≈ 0.28 / 0.794
Charge before 3 hours ≈ 0.3527

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours, where the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. We can set up another equation:

Charge before 3 hours = Initial charge * (1 - 0.09)^5
0.3527 ≈ Initial charge * (0.91)^5

Now, we can solve for the initial charge:
Initial charge ≈ 0.3527 / (0.91)^5
Initial charge ≈ 0.3527 / 0.624
Initial charge ≈ 0.565

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 56.5%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment. 

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10,000. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income, which is the sum of her wages and tips.
Total hourly income = $10/hour (wages) + $15/hour (tips) = $25/hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her total weekly income is:
Total weekly income = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
Number of weeks = Total amount needed / Total weekly income
= $2,000 / $1,000/week
= 2 weeks.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the amount left for plums is $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of pieces she gave away.

Anne started with 15 packs, each containing 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 15 * 60 = 900.

She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

The number of pieces she gave away is 900 - 120 = 780.

She gave the 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

Year 2: 
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we first need to find the total number of pictures in the 5 albums that are either portraits or selfies. Since there are 8 albums in total and each album has the same number of pictures, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures per album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums are selfies only and 2 albums are portraits. So, the total number of portraits and selfies is the sum of the pictures in these 5 albums.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27
Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18 = 45

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is:
2 * 15 = 30

Now, the total number of guests is:
76 + 30 = 106

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is:

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions by subtracting the number of easy questions from the total and dividing by 2. 
60 - 24 = 36 questions that are either average or difficult.
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions correct.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions correct and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions correct.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct: 
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get the total earnings as 12L + 4(2L) = 12L + 8L = 20L.

We know that the total earnings are $120, so we can set up the equation 20L = 120. Solving for L, we get L = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since S = 2L, the number of small stuffed animals sold is S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, she had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, for a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 blue balloons is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50%. In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of having the normal teacher and getting an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of having the normal teacher, not getting an extension, and getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of not having to turn in the homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

The area of the fabric piece is the product of the new length and width:
Area = length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total days by 3/8:
21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert the total days to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:
189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Initial price of the car = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Price after 1 year (2008) = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20000 - ($20000 * 0.21)
= $20000 - $4200
= $15800

Price after 2 years (2009) = Price after 1 year - (Price after 1 year * Depreciation rate)
= $15800 - ($15800 * 0.21)
= $15800 - $3328
= $12472

Price after 3 years (2010) = Price after 2 years - (Price after 2 years * Depreciation rate)
= $12472 - ($12472 * 0.21)
= $12472 - $2618.52

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the number of English and German books.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to first calculate the total distance she has driven so far. 

Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers
Number of days = 4
Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Now, we subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to New York City to find the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance to New York City - Total distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 - 1300
Remaining distance = 655

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
In 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find the number of gallons.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, so the number of people left is:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

There are 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, so for 4 twin beds, Greg will need 4 / 2 = 2 loads. For the king size bed, he will need 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food eaten per day is:
3 cats * 2 meals * 60 grams = 3 * 2 * 60 = 360 grams per day

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the amount eaten per day (360 grams):
720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

   Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 5.33 * 5 = 26.65 hours.

3. Extra learning time on weekends:
   John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday.
   First, we need to find the total number of minutes John spends in class per week: 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.
   Then, we calculate the extra learning time per weekend day: (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes.
   Converting this to hours, we get 100 / 60 = 1.67 hours per weekend day.
   Since John spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per weekend is 1.67 * 2 = 3.33 hours.

4. Total time spent learning per week:
   Adding the time spent in class per week and the extra learning time per weekend, we get 26.65 + 3.33 = 29.98 hours.

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height after the first bounce and then the height after the second bounce.

The initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

After the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To find the total earnings of the orchard, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5).

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms eaten by the Allosaurus.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the Allosaurus ate the remaining half. This means the velociraptors also ate 270 kilograms (since they ate the other half). 

So, the total weight after the T-Rex ate is 270 (Allosaurus) + 270 (velociraptors) = 540 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the 540 kilograms is the other half. To find the initial weight, we multiply 540 by 2.

Initial weight = 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days = 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

Number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Total number of people who arrived: 60 people + 420 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the people who arrived are the ones inside the church.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides.

Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discount.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. 
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
So, the discounted price of the frying pan is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00.
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
So, the discounted price of the set of towels is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to Sheila's balance:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, we need to calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can say that she needs to work for 40 years in total to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is:

Number of years she needs to work = 40 - x

However, since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide an exact answer.

But if we assume she just started working, then the number of years she needs to work is 40.

Then, we divide each of these parts into 5 equal parts:
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the percentage of the school population that the boys represent. Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following proportion:

40% of total students = 240

We can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * total students = 240

Now, we can solve for the total number of students by dividing both sides by 0.4:

total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Since the total number of students is 600, and 240 are boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, we assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300 miles in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles per day.

Now, we subtract her planned daily miles from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike: 310 - 250 = 60 miles per day.

It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, we can set up an equation where Sofie's total distance is twice Brian's total distance.

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional production after the 10-hour shift must produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together the four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

The weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time spent on the beach is given by distance/speed. So, 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes. This implies that x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk. The time spent on the sidewalk is given by distance/speed. So, 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20) miles/minute = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can set up an equation based on the final temperature of the water in the bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x' degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of 'x'-degree water into his bottle, the total volume becomes 5 ounces. The final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to set up the equation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees

Multiply both sides by 5 ounces to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x = 5 * 40
132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

The final answer: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

With a 10% discount, the total cost will be 90% of the original cost, which is 0.9 * $40.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen.

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 
5x + 9x = 84 

Combine like terms: 
14x = 84 

Divide both sides by 14: 
x = 6 

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

7 bouquets per day * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:

84 sunflowers per day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100, and each rock costs $5. To find the number of rocks he can buy, we divide the total money by the cost of each rock:

Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:

Number of rocks sold = Total rocks * 0.6
= 20 * 0.6
= 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

Total revenue = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

The total cost of the rocks is:

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
= 20 * $5
= $100

To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is:
$12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod

To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod:
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so the remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 50 - 10 = 40.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. 
The remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 40 - 20 = 20.

The total amount of money he has now is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has 3 * 400 = 1200 dollars.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. 
The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the amount of chalk left after Monday (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher will stop using the chalk when it is less than 2 inches. 

2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. However, since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is less than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to get to 2 inches.

Let's subtract the amount of chalk that will be left when the teacher stops using it (2 inches) from the amount of chalk left after Monday (2.75 inches): 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining amount of chalk that can be used (0.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch): 0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days.

Since the teacher already used 1 day (Monday), we add 0.75 days to 1 day and round down to the nearest whole number (since we can't have a fraction of a day), but in this case we will round up to the nearest whole number because 0.75 is closer to 1 than 0. 

1 + 0.75 = 1.75, rounded up is 2.

However, we must consider that 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days, and 2.75 days is 2 full days and 0.75 of a day. So the teacher will use the chalk for 2 full days and then on the third day the chalk will be less than 2 inches.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. 

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we can calculate the number of face masks Johnny bought as follows:

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of milk = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk.
2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the total refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the number of books he can buy per dollar by dividing 100 by 500.

100 books / $500 = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we can multiply this rate by the total amount Bob has to spend, $27000.

0.2 books per dollar * $27000 = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple to throw at the tree.
2. After throwing the apple, 5 more apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put all but 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple to throw at the tree. At this point, he has 1 (initial apple) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.
3. After throwing the apple, 6 more apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and added them to the apples he already had in his pocket.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home:
Apples in his pocket: 5 (from the previous step)
Apples that fell the last time: 6
Total apples = 5 + 6 = 11

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat a total of 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are:
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of snowballs he builds per minute:

20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so we can calculate the number of snowballs that melt per minute:

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt:

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15)
= (5/15) - (2/15)
= 3/15
= 1/5 snowballs per minute

Since Jay wants 60 snowballs, we can calculate the time it will take him to reach this goal:

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
= 60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute)
= 60 * 5
= 300 minutes

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference and then apply it to Jim's age.

Since John is 28 now and the anniversary marks 20 years since Digimon came out, we can find John's age at that time by subtracting 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago.

Let Jim's age 20 years ago be x.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

Now, we know Jim's age 20 years ago was 4. To find his current age, we add 20 to that.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

"To find the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. 

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, before using 25 bandages, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, before using 38 bandages, they had 103 - 28 - 50 = 25 bandages.

Since they used 38 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 25 + 38 = 63 bandages.

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles of scotch
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Since the cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle, we can calculate the cost per bottle of cognac as follows:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of cost per bottle of scotch)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so the number of bottles of cognac is:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10
Number of bottles of cognac = 20

Now, we can calculate the total cost of cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, the height of the second floor is the total height minus the height of the first floor. So, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to subtract the height of the second floor's floor from the total height of the second floor. Since the height of the second floor's floor is the same as the first floor's height (as it's a two-story house with equal floor heights), we subtract 180 inches from 240 inches.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (120 students) and the capacity of John's school (30 students).

Combined capacity = 120 + 30
Combined capacity = 150

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount he owes is the sum of the borrowed amount and the interest.
Total amount = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the difference between the total amount and the amount paid in 11 months.
Amount paid in the twelfth month = Total amount - Total paid in 11 months
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $31

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan changes the remaining diapers, he changes 10 - 5 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean. The total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true number and the estimated number, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is:
20 + 40 = 60

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is:
(3/4) * 40 = 30

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is:
60 + 30 = 90

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is:
90 * 2 = 180

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
200 - 180 = 20

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):
4x = 4 * 8

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) should be 2 times the number of people in the class, which is 5. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms. 
Time spent per classroom = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent cleaning to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so the total time available is:
8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours

The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have already been accounted for, the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, we add the amount of water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and swim through water, then add them together.

The total distance is 200 yards, with half on land and half in water. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is half the cost of the main phone. 

Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2 = $10

There are 4 additional phones. 

Cost of additional phones = 4 * $10 = $40

Total cost of the phone plan = Cost of main phone + Cost of additional phones
Total cost of the phone plan = $20 + $40
Total cost of the phone plan = $60

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 by 2.5.

New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply 450 by 10.

Total words = 450 * 10 = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To determine the number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total number of gallons of lemonade Tim will make. He originally planned to make 4 gallons, but his friend asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.

So, the total number of gallons of lemonade is 4 (regular) + 1 (twice as tart) = 5 gallons.

However, the twice-as-tart gallon will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice required is 4 (regular) + 2 (twice as tart) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed is 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the two children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01.

- 5 sugar cookies

Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

After eating 3 cookies for an early day snack (1 of each flavor):
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4
Total cookies after snack = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

After eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)
Total cookies after lunch = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

After giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2
Total cookies after giving to friends = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

After baking 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6
Total cookies after baking = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

"To find the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for each half of the collection and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of the collection would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount would be 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, let's calculate the net number of holes Nate fills in per day. Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, Nate effectively fills in 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes Nate fills in per day.

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total number of cookies made - Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which was 14. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes. Let's denote the number of beakers as B. Then, we can write the equation:

8 (test tubes) + B (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 29

Combine the constants:
8 + 16 = 24
24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:
B = 5

Since Igor gathered 5 beakers, but Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, Igor lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it contains 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430. 
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

Distance Vanessa ran = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
4 = 2 * Distance Aaron ran
Distance Aaron ran = 4 / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can set up a proportion to find the time it would take Vanessa to run 2 miles:

Time Aaron ran 2 miles / Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = Speed ratio
16 / Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 2
Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 16 / 2
Time Vanessa ran 2 miles = 8 minutes

However, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she runs at a constant speed, we can multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2:

Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * Time Vanessa ran 2 miles
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 2 * 8
Time Vanessa ran 4 miles = 16 minutes

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Length of dock = 200 feet
Line needed per foot of dock = 3 feet

Total line needed = Length of dock * Line needed per foot of dock
Total line needed = 200 * 3
Total line needed = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total line needed to find out how much more he needs to buy.

Line needed to buy = Total line needed - Line already available
Line needed to buy = 600 - 6
Line needed to buy = 594 feet

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. 
Profit per watermelon = 25% of cost price per watermelon
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first find the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. 

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 / 4 = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400:
80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The price Mark pays for the radiator is the original price minus the discount:
$400 - $320 = $80

The cost of the mechanic's labor is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours:
$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the cost of the mechanic's labor:
$80 + $150 = $230

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 30 / 2
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

The number of chickens is 5.
