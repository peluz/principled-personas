"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings at the farmers' market are 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the value added by the repairs to the original value of the house. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, the value added by the repairs is $50,000 * (150/100) = $75,000. The new value is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000 + $50,000 (original cost of repairs) is not correct. We should use the $200,000 value.

The selling price is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken gets per day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total amount of feed needed per day) - 40 (amount of feed given in the first two meals) = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can group the remaining 14 glasses into 7 pairs. Each pair consists of one glass at full price ($5) and one glass at 60% of the price ($3).

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 
The cost of 7 pairs is 7 * $8 = $56.

Adding the cost of the first two glasses ($5 + $3 = $8) to the cost of the remaining 14 glasses ($56), we get:
$8 + $56 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first find the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep:
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla has already downloaded 80 GB before the restart, so she doesn't need to download that part again. But since she has to restart the download from the beginning, we still consider the time it takes to download the entire file.

The total time it takes to download the file is the time it took to download 80 GB before the restart (40 minutes), plus the time it took for the restart (20 minutes), plus the time it takes to download the entire file again (100 minutes). 

Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at a speed of 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drove at a speed of 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

So, the total distance covered by John in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance he covered in those 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he covered in the 4 hours from the initial distance:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered in 4 hours = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Now, let's calculate her earnings for regular hours:
Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her overtime earnings:
Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $60
Total earnings = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue exceeds the total cost in the 6th year.

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as 'x'. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
Simplifying this, we get (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 or (x/3) - 1. 
Now, she has (2x/3) - 2 - ((x/3) - 1) vacuum cleaners left. 
Simplifying this, we get (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
So, (x/3) - 1 = 5. 
Solving for x, we get x/3 = 6, and x = 18.

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = Initial value * Increase rate = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, to convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

The time Marissa has already taken is 2 hours, so the time she has left to cover the remaining distance is:
Remaining time = Total time - Time taken
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance:
Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165.

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to first determine her running and walking speeds.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the distance Dana can travel in six hours, spending one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking

"To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find the distance outside of the flames where she can still hit the dragon: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, multiply the weight per serving by 0.8.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of a blue tie = $40
50% of the cost of a blue tie = 0.5 * $40
= $20
Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + 50% of the cost of a blue tie
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then find 3/4 of that number to determine the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

Total number of floors in the building: 15
Number of units per floor: 8
Total number of units in the building: 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Occupied units = 3/4 * Total units
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120
Occupied units = 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

Eggs per week = 252 * 7 = 1764

Now, let's calculate the total number of dozens of eggs produced per week:
Dozens per week = 1764 / 12 = 147

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining number of lollipops by 2. 

28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. Since the tank was not empty when she started (it was 12 - 4 = 8 gallons full), we can assume that she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. However, to get the actual miles per gallon, we should consider the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles traveled. Since the tank was 8 gallons full initially and 4 gallons were added, we can assume that 4 gallons were used from the 8 gallons that were already in the tank. So, the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles is 4 gallons (added) + 4 gallons (used from the initial 8 gallons) = 8 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:
mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 8 gallons (used for the 100 miles, not the 4 gallons added)
However, this is not the correct way to calculate mpg in this scenario. We should calculate mpg as follows:
mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used to travel those miles
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons (used to travel those 100 miles, not the total gallons in the tank)
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas:
Total miles per tank = Total gallons in the tank * miles per gallon
Total miles per tank = 12 gallons * 25 miles per gallon
Total miles per tank = 300 miles

"To find their combined weights, we first need to find Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:
3 * 25 = 75 roses

Then, multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
75 * 8 = 600 thorns

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'L' and the number of games they won as 'W'. We know that the team played 22 games in total, so the sum of the games they won and lost is 22. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations:

W + L = 22 (total games played)
W = L + 8 (they won 8 more than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times the alarm rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's completed 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase every year. 
After the first year (or 6th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$600 + 10% of $600 = $600 + $60 = $660

After the second year (or 7th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726

After the third year (or 8th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary: 
$798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. We can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Now, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16, which gives us 4. This means Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used. 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in this number. Since we want to know the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can say that the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by adding the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

Total pages = 39 

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages are left to read.

Pages left = Total pages - Pages read on Monday 
Pages left = 39 - 15 
Pages left = 24 

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day on average for the remaining 4 days.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so that's 1 more glass of water. However, since he has soda with dinner on the other weekend day, we don't count that one. So, on weekends, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water.

Now, let's add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 7 = 27.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies. So, before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the number of cookies he meant to bake is 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he baked last year can be found by dividing 100 by 2.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the distance she rows per second, we divide the distance by the time:
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can find the total distance by multiplying the time by the speed:
1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find the total amount of water taken on, we divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2:

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40% (although the problem doesn't explicitly state this, it's a reasonable assumption given the context). We can calculate Lylah's new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters she stamped and then subtract that from the total number of already-stamped letters.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5.

While making the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had left was x + 5 - 3.

We are given that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Cost to the hospital per hour: $150
Total cost to the hospital per day: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Revenue from patients per hour: $200
Total revenue from patients per day: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the value of B from the first equation into the second equation, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the values of B and W in terms of Q, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in costs between the two options.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which is equivalent to 3 * $35 = $105 in missed income.

If she hires the accountant, she will pay $90.

The difference in costs is $105 (missed income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Seth is 16 years old.

Total minimum payment per month: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total payment per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

According to the second statement, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities of each roll.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

To find the difference in probabilities, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese.

Total slices of cheese used = Total slices for lunch + Total slices for breakfast + Total slices for dinner
Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices
Total slices of cheese used = 31 slices

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is:
22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

Then, Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is:
6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is:
2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of blue and red pens she bought:
32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. 

Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, we consider the average of 5 tests. The desired average is 93, so the total score for 5 tests should be 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score of the first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since she can remove the lowest score (71), we subtract it from the total: 
438 - 71 = 367

Now, we add the score of the sixth test (x) to 367 and set it equal to the total score needed (465) to achieve the desired average:
367 + x = 465

Subtract 367 from both sides:
x = 465 - 367
x = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. 
Distance covered in a week = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers
Distance covered in four weeks = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.
Distance covered in a week = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers
Distance covered in three weeks = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 from it to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups to find the cost of each cup: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Number of customers on the third day = Total number of customers by the third day - Total number of customers on the first two days
= 500 - 250
= 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, the total amount of water leaked from each pool is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is 'x - 16'. The amount of water in the big pool now is '2x - 16'.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x', we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16
= 8

Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back, which includes the principal amount and the additional 10% interest.

Principal amount = $2000
Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount = Principal amount + Interest = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay back:
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. 

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time Mike spends writing per week is 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation is: 28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and then apply the discount.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
The makeup work takes 6 hours per day, and it's done 4 times a week. 
So, the total hours per week is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours of makeup work is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The total cost without discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

The total amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of cake ingredients + cost of birthday presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories her sister consumed = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 12 cougars and 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

The total number of animals Rick killed today is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the cows. So, we assume there were 10 stalls initially, but after Mr. Sylas buys the cows, the cows are divided into 20 stalls.

Initially, there are 10 * 20 = 200 cows in 10 stalls. After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

These 240 cows are divided into 20 stalls. So, the number of cows in each stall is 240 / 20 = 12 cows per stall.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying it by the weight of each section (400 pounds).

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find the weight of the tree after the termites ate 30% of it. To do this, we'll find 30% of the total weight and subtract it from the total weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to get the total number of dozens. 
66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we know the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. Since the car in the slow lane needs to cover the same distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the car in the slow lane, time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Now, divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes worked by 10: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 15 * $5 = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to first calculate the points each player has after 3 rounds and then add the extra points.

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Since Mike and Tony have over 20 points, they each get an extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

Mike's new total: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim's new total: 18 points (no change)
Tony's new total: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points of all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (by the oldest) + 4 (by the youngest) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed by his sons.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last: 42 / 14 = 3.

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

So, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000
Total bonus given to the driver per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) - Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) - Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) - Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the pages are paired in a way that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

In this case, we can pair the pages as follows:

Page 1 (back) - Page 32 (front)
Page 2 (back) - Page 31 (front)

Page 16 (back) - Page 17 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can see that 16 pieces of paper are still required.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.
His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month is his monthly earnings from his hourly wage plus the total bonus. 
His monthly earnings from his hourly wage is $500 * 4 = $2000.
His total earnings for the month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find out how many loaves are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in 1 week, we can find out how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost by Sandy in 4 weeks = 2 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. 
Weight lost by Sandy in 4 weeks = 2 pounds.
To lose 8 pounds, it will take Sandy 8 / 2 = 4 weeks.

However, this is the time it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, it will take Sandy 4 * 4 = 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from ice cream and milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount available for gifts: 
Total budget = $6000
Amount to be saved = $2000
Amount available for gifts = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. Total number of players = 105
2. O = 2D (twice as many players on the offense as on the defense)
3. S = D/2 (half the number of players on the special teams as on the defense)

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + D + D/2) / 2 = 105
(9D/2) / 2 = 105
9D/4 = 105

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate D:
9D = 420

Divide both sides by 9:
D = 420 / 9
D = 46.67

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a player). However, in this case, we can see that the numbers don't add up to 105 if we round down. Let's try rounding up to the nearest whole number and see if it works.

D = 47 (rounding up to the nearest whole number)

Now, let's check if the numbers add up to 105:
O = 2D = 2 * 47 = 94
S = D/2 = 47/2 = 23.5 (round down to 23, as you can't have a fraction of a player)

Total number of players = O + D + S = 94 + 47 + 23 = 164 (this is more than 105)

Let's try D = 35 (a lower value for D):
O = 2D = 2 * 35 = 70
S = D/2 = 35/2 = 17.5 (round down to 17, as you can't have a fraction of a player)

Total number of players = O + D + S = 70 + 35 + 17 = 122 (this is still more than 105)

Let's try D = 30:
O = 2D = 2 * 30 = 60
S = D/2 = 30/2 = 15

Total number of players = O + D + S = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105

This combination works.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

7 new records / 5 people = 1.4 new records per person

Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we can multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to get the average number of old records per person.

1.4 new records per person * 2 old records per new record = 2.8 old records per person

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1 person.

Now, let's subtract this net change from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 20 - 1 = 19.

This means that before the second stop, there were 19 people on the bus.

We also know that at the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, to find out how many people were on the bus before the first stop (i.e., the number of people who got on at the terminal), we subtract 5 from 19: 19 - 5 = 14.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage of charge) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 2 hours

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. They earn $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. Since each reward is $1 off, they earned a total of 4 * $1 = $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39. 

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off. 

So, the final price the customer paid is $39 - $8 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes.

Difference = Net income of Job B - Net income of Job A
= $32,400 - $24,000

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider Richard (or RJ) to have 1 gun.

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
Total number of guns = 24

Now, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally.

Number of people = 4

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we know that the smallest group has 'x - 10' students. So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

"To find the total number of legs, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c'. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2c.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
c + 2c = 60
Combine like terms:
3c = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (c = 20), we can find the number of chickens:
Number of chickens = 2c = 2 * 20 = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and add them together:
Total legs = (40 chickens * 2 legs) + (20 cows * 4 legs)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the following:

- The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals:
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, the total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold:
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50

Total number of tennis shoes sold: 50"
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day.

- Tuesdays: 1 hour
- Thursdays: 2 hours

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since 40% of the equipment is faulty, we can calculate the cost of the faulty equipment as follows:

Cost of faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the cost of faulty equipment from the total cost:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total cost - Cost of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples she picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, she also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months or 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08
Total amount to be paid ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Anna's silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
Total number of messages = 88

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many popsicles each part represents, we divide 165 by 11.

165 / 11 = 15

Now that we know each part represents 15 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Energy = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy used in a day is:

Energy = Power * Time

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20 
= 0.3 * $20 
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = $14 * 4 
= $56

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- Half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples
- An unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this 'x'

Her sister gathered:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples
- No apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine the constants:
30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150

Now the equation becomes:
150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

We know that each camel has one head and two humps, and each dromedary has one head and one hump. We are given that there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

We can set up two equations based on this information:

1. The total number of heads: c + d = 180
2. The total number of humps: 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations to find the number of dromedaries. 

First, let's isolate 'c' in the first equation: c = 180 - d

Now, substitute 'c' in the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Expanding the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304

Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides: -d = -56

Multiply both sides by -1: d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information into two weeks.

In the first week:
- Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
- Distance traveled in the next 2 days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
- Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (since he wasn't traveling)

Total distance in the first week: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km = 1040 km

In the second week:
- Distance traveled per day: 300 km
- Total distance in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during the two-week-long trip: 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
= 4 * 5 cubic inches
= 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker
= 2 * 20 cubic inches

The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's elevation of 10,000 feet, so the elevation of the comb is:
10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of the comb, he needs to climb:

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months (introductory) - 8 months (normal rate) = 10 months at $14 per month.
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer will be negative.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

We know Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's set up an equation to find the total number of cards:

Number of cards sold = (2/3) * Total number of cards
100 = (2/3) * Total number of cards

To find the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total number of cards = 100 * (3/2)
= 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he actually spent is:
$5 - (1% of $5) = $5 - $0.05 = $4.95

Now, subtract the amount he spent on chips from the total amount he spent:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75

This is the amount he spent on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many he bought:

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width of the room. 

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width of the room, we can find the perimeter using the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)

- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
- James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 
- James' swim time = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
- James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. 
So, James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes 
- James' total time = 170 + 10 
- James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' time for the run:

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds and then divide it by the volume of each bag of potting soil.

The volume of each raised bed is 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. 
Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Initially, there were 30 students with 10 pencils each, so the total pencils at the beginning of the year were 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. 1/5 of 300 is 300 / 5 = 60 pencils.

So, the remaining pencils after two months were 300 - 60 = 240.

By the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 2/3 of the remaining pencils were used. 2/3 of 240 is (2/3) * 240 = 160 pencils used.

The remaining pencils at the end of the year were 240 - 160 = 80.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other two packs of gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. 
The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

For 2 x 4 wood: 
- Cost per piece: $4
- Sticks per piece: 200
- Sticks per dollar: 200 / 4 = 50

For 2 x 8 wood: 
- Cost per piece: $6
- Sticks per piece: 400
- Sticks per dollar: 400 / 6 ≈ 66.67

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, it is the cheapest option. Now, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24.

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = Total budget / Cost per piece
= $24 / $6
= 4

Total sticks = Number of 2 x 8 pieces * Sticks per piece
= 4 * 400
= 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is:
6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
12 pairs * $12/pair = $144

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, so she takes 2 * 5 = 10 trips a week. Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. 
The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, we need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's calculate the remaining money:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of the remaining money ($400) is:

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue. 

First, let's calculate the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40 bags. However, the cost is given per pack, not per bag. So, the total cost is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Tara sold the bags for $8 each. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the total amount of money he initially had, then find the amount he gave to his sister, and finally determine the amount he spent on dinner.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts/week - 2016 kilowatts/week = 336 kilowatts/week.

Since a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is 336 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $504.

x = 60 - 5
x = 55

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55:

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. April has 30 days. 

Let's assume the daily savings for the first half is 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings for the second half will be '2x'.

The first half of the month has 15 days (1-15 April), and the second half has 15 days as well (16-30 April).

The total savings for the first half will be 15x, and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The sum of the total savings for both halves should be equal to Elvis's monthly savings target:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 * 2 = 52 letters
2. She writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters (this is what she re-writes)

Total number of letters written = 52 (initial full alphabets) + 13 (half alphabet) + 65 (re-writing everything) = 130 letters

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Total weight lost in 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Final weight = 70 pounds
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds

James's play set has 80 toys. Five times that number is 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. So, if we subtract 2 from 400, we can find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

For the amount over $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

To find the total amount Antonella earned, we add the commission from the first $1000 and the commission from the amount over $1000:

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 + 2 * 16 = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day, we can't directly calculate the time. But we can assume that the time it takes on a hot day is the same as on a warm day, as there's no other information provided.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, on a cold day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a warm (or hot) day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, on a warm (or hot) day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate it by multiplying Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from Juan's current coffee intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time she spent reading: 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Now, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from the nephew's age in 7 years:

"To find out how many action figures Peter can buy, we first need to determine how much he spent from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day for a week, we can divide his total money by 7 to find the daily amount.

Daily amount = $70 / 7 = $10

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent $10 each day on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. So, the number of wooden action figures he bought in 4 days is:

Number of wooden action figures = (4 * $10) / $5 = 8

Now, we need to find out how much he spent on wooden action figures and subtract that from his total money to find out how much he has left for the rest of the week.

Total spent on wooden action figures = 8 * $5 = $40

Money left = $70 - $40 = $30

Since he has $30 left for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), and he spends $10 each day, he can spend $10 each day for 3 days on plastic action figures.

Number of plastic action figures = ($10 * 3) / $2 = 15

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Discounted price of 1 box: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Total cost of 2 boxes: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, the total number of contacts in 2 boxes is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
Total cost of 2 boxes: $180.00
Total number of contacts: 180
Cost per contact: $180.00 / 180 = $1.00

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to first find his final typing speed after the second increase. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his typing speed is 52 WPM. 
After the second increase of 5 WPM, his typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements by adding them together and dividing by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute difference between the weight loss and weight gain:
8.75 pounds (gain) + 6.25 pounds (loss) = 15 pounds

"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of them will invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is:
100 (initial invitees) + 100 * 2 (friends of invitees) = 100 + 200 = 300

Next, let's consider the people invited via phone call. Alex called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited via phone call is:
10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

Now, we add the total number of people invited via email and phone call to get the total number of people attending the event:
300 (email invitees) + 18 (phone invitees) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, as she will also be attending the event. So, the total number of seats needed is:
318 (total attendees) + 1 (Alex) = 319

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the total cost is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8. The total cost on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost: $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two options. To do this, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the amount of protein he gets per day is 200 grams * 0.03 grams of protein per gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of protein John gets per week is 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the angles.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then multiply by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find his hourly production rate, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours:
120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production rate:
(3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours they worked (12 hours) to find their total production:
Ruiz: 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa: 90 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual production:
720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, the total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
The total earnings in the first 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, the total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
The total earnings in the next 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

The total earnings from selling lemonade for 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

Now, let's calculate the total rotations per year:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles per month = 145,000 rotations per month.
145,000 rotations per month * 12 months per year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

"To find the cost of each pump, we first need to find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings. However, a more straightforward approach is to realize that if 2 pumps give 120 washings, then 1 pump will give 60 washings. 

Since the bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps, it will give 120 * 2 = 240 pumps in total (120 washings * 2 pumps per washing). 

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the total number of pumps. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240
Cost per pump = $0.10

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price.
Sale price = $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the sale price, we don't need to add any additional tax.

Now, we subtract the sale price from the amount Joe has to find out how much he will have left.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

Initial 5 months: 
The initial funding is $100,000 for 5 months. This means the monthly funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Additional months: 
The research took 10 times the initial duration, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months. However, we need to subtract the initial 5 months, so the additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The funding for the additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Initial 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
Total price = 4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. 

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. This is the difference between their speeds, since they are moving in the same direction. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. 

Let's divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes he can attend: 
$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she can process twice the number of customers Jewel does. 

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost per unit of each item and then multiply it by the number of items.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost per apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.
The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add the cost of all the features to the base price:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his current salary of $20,000.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

However, the bonus is not a regular monthly income, so we need to calculate the total yearly income with the bonus added only once.

Yearly salary (without bonus) = $21,000 * 12 = $252,000

Total yearly income (including bonus) = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the total number of cookies: 
Katarina's cookies: 68
Max's cookies: 73
Cookie Monster's cookies: 61
Summer's cookies: 96
Total cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20. 

We are given that the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

"To find the total time taken, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together.

Time taken in turtle mode for half the lawn: Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in turtle mode, he can mow half the lawn in 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Time taken in rabbit mode for half the lawn: Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, he can mow half the lawn in 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Total time taken = Time taken in turtle mode + Time taken in rabbit mode
Total time taken = 30 + 20

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t.

The combined ages of all the children are 44, so we can write the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combine like terms: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5t = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins: T = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.

The age of one of the twins is 13."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 - 80
Time for nap = 100 minutes.

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, subtract the cost of lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in a year:
Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year.
Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, the total number of coins each of them has is:
Rong: 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
Neil: 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
2400 (Rong) + 3360 (Neil) = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits it contains.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.5. So, the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, which is $1. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of the individual fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs required.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Total chairs currently available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs required. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Total high chairs required = 15 (given that there are 15 babies)
Total regular chairs required = 42 (given that there are 42 adults)

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

Total regular chairs required = 42, and she already has 40 regular chairs. So, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The total cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt and the potential fine from the city council. 

Cost of asphalt = 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
Potential fine from the city council = $120
Total cost of fixing the pothole = $75 + $120 = $195

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed, which is $450.

Amount saved by fixing the pothole = Potential damage - Total cost of fixing the pothole
Amount saved by fixing the pothole = $450 - $195
Amount saved by fixing the pothole = $255

"To find the total number of chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Total normal chairs = 170
Total baby chairs = 23
Total chairs = 170 + 23 = 193

Chairs sent for repair:
Normal chairs = 20
Baby chairs = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Now, subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
193 - 33 = 160

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. 

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes 

Now, we can find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2 
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 
Average time = 50 minutes / 2 
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need.

120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores apiece, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores.
6 adults want 1 s'more apiece, so they need 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores.
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed.
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed.
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a box, and we need exactly 3 sleeves, we can conclude that we need 1 box of graham crackers.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate it as 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate A and candidate B received.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters. 

Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Number of votes candidate C received = Total number of voters - Total votes received by candidate A and candidate B

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. 
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books.

Given that 5 students like to play basketball, and the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as follows:
Number of students who like to play music = 2 * Number of students who like to play basketball
Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5
Number of students who like to play music = 10

Now, we know that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. The total number of students who have these three hobbies is:
10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25

Since there are 50 students in total, and 25 students have the above-mentioned hobbies, the remaining students must like to play video games.

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students.

We already know that 6 groups can be formed with 54 students. To find the number of groups needed to form 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups that can be formed from the required number of groups.

12 (required groups) - 6 (groups that can be formed) = 6

However, this is incorrect as we are not considering the fact that we cannot form 12 groups with 54 students. We can only form 6 groups with 54 students. The question asks how many more groups are needed to form, but we cannot form more groups with the given number of students.

The correct interpretation of the question is that we need to find the number of groups that need to be added to the existing 6 groups to reach a total of 12 groups, assuming that we can add more students.

6 (existing groups) - 6 (existing groups) = 0, then 12 - 6 = 6

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. A large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

In total, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we first need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the first house needs x/2 shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x shingles.

We know the total number of shingles is 250. So, we can set up the equation: 
x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms: 
(1/2)x + 2x = 250
(5/2)x = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 shingles, we can find out how many shingles the third house needs. The third house needs x shingles, which is 100."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so he spent 1 * $3 = $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90
Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she spent on the candy bars. 

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on the ball. So, the amount of money she had left for the candy bars is $80 - $20 = $60.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can find the number of candy bars by dividing the amount of money she had left by the cost of each candy bar: $60 / $5 = 12.

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the books Ezra read initially (300) and the additional books he decided to read (150) to find his total. 
Ezra's total = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals.
Total books read = Ezra's total + Ahmed's total = 450 + 150 = 600 books.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time spent driving to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time spent driving to the museum = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost of series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. The number of older movies is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. The number of normal movies is:
400 - 160 = 240 movies
Total cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours (since they hiked for 1.5 hours). 

Distance driven = Speed * Time 
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours 
Distance driven = 225 miles

Now, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour

Distance hiked = Speed * Time 
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours 
Distance hiked = 30 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Then Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. 
Points from enemies for Emma = 10x
Points from enemies for Ava = 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Then Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.
Points from berries for Emma = 5y
Points from berries for Ava = 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Then Ava finishes the level with 'z - 4' seconds left.
Points from time for Emma = 30z
Points from time for Ava = 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for Emma and Ava:
Total points for Emma = 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava = (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava = 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their two scores = Total points for Ava - Total points for Emma

According to the problem, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:

(3 + 17 - x) = 2 * (4 + x)

3/5 of 10 twenties is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. 
Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters, and she spent all of them. 
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount spent from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 'x'. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can first divide both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

Expanding the equation:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Overall pass rate: 70%"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area of the mosaic in square inches. 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can divide the total area by the height to find the length. 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining tea to the total amount of tea consumed, we get:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To find out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the number of additional students by the end of May, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Felix charges $0.25 per branch and made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches, we divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows.

Marshmallows left = 35 (original) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the marshmallows left is equal to the number of marshmallows left. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

z (zest) + z (fragrance) + 2z (salt) + 2z (sugar) + 4z (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
z = 1

Now that we know z is 1, we can find the amount of oil:
Amount of oil = 4z = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially had: Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially had 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold: Joe sold 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother: Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gave away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left: Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, the number of cars Joe has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

We know that there are 5 students who are good at math only. To find the number of students who are good at both math and English, we need to subtract the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can find the total number of students who are good at math by adding the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time taken by each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total for the three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

I am 2 years older than my sister, so:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87:
A + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for A and M in terms of B into the equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
6B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
6B = 96

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks required = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in a pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of packs required = Total glue sticks required / Number of glue sticks in a pack
= 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack
= 6.75 packs

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of petals for each type of flower, we need to multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower.

For the orchids: 5 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 25 petals
For the daisies: 4 flowers * 10 petals/flower = 40 petals

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids. 
Difference = Total petals of daisies - Total petals of orchids

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor plants and the number of outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25

Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total amount she made from mowing lawns: 
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: $18
- Alba's lawn: $30
Total from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the total amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made:
$80 - $54 = $26

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles. 
So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance.
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in terms of child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:

20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 total pieces - 40 pieces at red balloons = 18 pieces at yellow balloons

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces at yellow balloons / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He has also seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. The total amount spent on movies so far is $50 + $56 = $106.

He has also had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He has had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. The total amount spent on snacks so far is $16 + $8 = $24.

The total amount spent so far is $106 + $24 = $130.

Colby has $150 for the month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute P and L in the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43200 * 6 = $259200
Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 * 6 = $194400

The difference in revenue is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will be charged at 70 pesos per hour, so 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25-dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for after the discount, and the amount he sold the 5 CDs for.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost (100% - 40% = 60%). 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40. To find the cost of these 5 CDs, we need to calculate the cost per CD after the discount. 
The cost per CD after the discount is $90 / 10 CDs = $9 per CD.
The cost of the 5 CDs he sold is 5 CDs * $9 per CD = $45.

The amount James was out is the difference between the cost of the 5 CDs he sold and the amount he sold them for, plus the cost of the remaining 5 CDs.
The amount James was out = ($45 - $40) + $45 = $5 + $45 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that B + A + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation B + A + D = 45 with A + 20. This gives us A + 20 + A + D = 45.

We also know that B = D + 10, so A + 20 = D + 10. Rearranging this equation, we get D = A + 10.

Now, we can substitute D in the equation A + 20 + A + D = 45 with A + 10. This gives us A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

We know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes, which is 2 reports per minute.

So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons.

2. Distance traveled in the northerly direction for the second leg:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the third leg:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use by the amount in each bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car = $100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then calculate their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, we subtract 5 years from their ages at that time to find their current ages.

Emil's dad's current age: 48 - 5 = 43 years old
Emil's brother's current age: 12 - 5 = 7 years old

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught and then divide it by the weight of one serving.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total pounds of crawfish Joe caught is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants to find out how many plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines for each basket, then multiply by the number of baskets.

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights to Greece. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany.

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is 4x. There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total size of all slices is 4x (kids) + 4x (adults) = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x / 8x) * 100% = 25%.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 + 4125 = 13025 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining.

Let's start with the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 3 hours as follows:

Let x be the charge at the beginning of the 3 hours.
x - 3 * 7% of x = 28%
x - 0.21x = 28%
0.79x = 28%
x = 28% / 0.79
x = 35.44%

Now, we know that the charge at the beginning of the 3 hours was 35.44%. Before this, the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. We can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 5 hours as follows:

Let y be the charge at the beginning of the 5 hours.
y - 5 * 9% of y = 35.44%
y - 0.45y = 35.44%
0.55y = 35.44%
y = 35.44% / 0.55
y = 64.43%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 64.43%.

"To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we first need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums = 72 / 8 = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. So, the total number of selfies and portraits is the sum of the pictures in these albums.

Number of selfie albums = 3
Number of portrait albums = 2
Total number of selfie and portrait albums = 3 + 2 = 5

Pictures in selfie and portrait albums = Pictures per album * Total number of selfie and portrait albums = 9 * 5 = 45

However, this is not the correct answer as the question asks for the number of portraits and selfies. Since we know the number of albums for each, we can find the number of portraits and selfies separately.

Number of selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums = 9 * 3 = 27
Number of portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums = 9 * 2 = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits = 27 + 18 = 45

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many minutes it takes him to read one page and then multiply that by the total number of pages he read.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to read one page, we divide 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page (approximately)

Now, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read:

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

"To find the total number of guests the hotel now has, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked out and the number of guests who checked in.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 
24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.
15 guests elected for a late checkout, but they are still in the hotel, so the number of guests remains 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the total number of guests: 
76 (remaining guests) + 30 (afternoon check-ins) + 7 (dinner check-ins) = 113

The hotel now has 113 guests."

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
40% of 60 questions = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult.
60% of 60 questions = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.

Total questions Aries is sure to get correct: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get $4 * 2L = $8 * L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: $12 * L + $8 * L = $120. Combining like terms, we get $20 * L = $120.

Dividing both sides by $20, we get L = 6. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this value to get S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

In a month with 30 days, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds of ore.

Now, let's multiply this by 40 dwarves:

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the first two packages and then apply it to the third package.

For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich.

For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be $1.5. 

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework is 50% (or 0.5).
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 0.76

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 1 - 0.76 = 0.24, or 24%.

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles.

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the fabric piece by multiplying the new length and width.

Area of one fabric piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in a weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food they eat per day (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 / 360 = 2

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we first need to determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

Total slices eaten: 31"
"To find the time it took for Betsy's part, let's denote Donovan's time as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's time can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's time, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's time is 'x + 18', we can now find Betsy's time:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18
Betsy's time = 58

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.7 = 14
Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Total number of pizzas left = 6 (from the glee club) + 8 (from the football team) = 14

700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:

"To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:
Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = 20 - 5 = 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying:
Total tons of fertiliser delivered = 15 * 20 = 300

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there is an additional charge of $6 for each guest beyond 20. Since there are 41 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The additional cost is 21 * $6 = $126. Adding this to the initial fee, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide this by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day:
315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
10 bananas + 4 bananas = 14 bananas per day

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is:
10 bananas + 14 bananas = 24 bananas per day

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day:

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves at 125 minutes as well.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is the total distance divided by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Growth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now, we can calculate the growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years.

   There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 8 classes per day. 
   Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

2. Time spent in class per week: 
   Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

3. Extra learning time on weekends: 
   John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday. 
   First, we need to convert the total weekly minutes to hours: 1600 minutes / 60 = 26.67 hours. 
   Then, we convert this to minutes: 26.67 * 60 = 1600 minutes. 
   Now, we can find the extra learning time per weekend day: 1600 * (1/16) = 100 minutes.

4. Total extra learning time on weekends: 
   Since John spends 100 minutes on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is 100 * 2 = 200 minutes.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time taken to ride the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed
Time taken to ride the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time taken to ride the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time taken to ride the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed
Time taken to ride the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time taken to ride the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in time:
Difference in time = Time taken to ride the biggest slide - Time taken to ride the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time for breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes. 
The total time for lunch and breaks per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time for lunch and breaks per day is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5. 
Total time = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first calculate the total miles run by Amber and Micah. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

The total miles run by Amber and Micah is 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52 miles, Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discount.

Frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 (discount)
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 (discount)
Set of towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light, and these are a third of the large jellyfish. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3.

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can find the total number of jellyfish by multiplying 18 by 5.

18 * 5 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she would need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she wants to retire in 20 years, and she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then she would have saved 20,000 * x dollars so far.

The amount she needs to save in the next 20 years is:
$800,000 - $20,000 * x

The amount she will save in the next 20 years is:
$20,000 * 20

Equating the two, we get:
$20,000 * 20 = $800,000 - $20,000 * x
$400,000 = $800,000 - $20,000 * x
$20,000 * x = $400,000
x = 20

This means she has been working for 20 years already. Therefore, she needs to work for 20 more years.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the total population based on the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total population = 240
0.4 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total miles she plans to hike in a day and the total miles she needs to hike in a day to complete her journey.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so her planned daily miles are 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, let's assume June has 30 days. To complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time. 
310 miles per day (required) - 250 miles per day (planned) = 60 miles per day.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
To do this, we divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

First, we calculate the distance of the one-way trip. We know the time taken (2 hours) and the speed (70 mph), so we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Camden painted compared to Arnold, we need to first determine the number of eggs each person painted.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs.

Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number, we can divide 26 by 2 to find the number of eggs each of them painted:
26 / 2 = 13

Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs. To find the difference, subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

Using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows:
Time = 40 minutes, Distance = 2 miles
Speed (x) = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
Distance = 1 mile, Speed = 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The temperature of the mixture is the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters. We can set up the following equation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. 

There are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the number of women initially on the bus:

(9/14) * 84 = 54

So, there were 54 women initially on the bus. 

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
13 (individual sunflowers) + 84 (sunflowers in bouquets) = 97 sunflowers

To find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100, and he invests all of it in buying rocks at $5 each. The number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:
20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days it will take her to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the number of days for each type of scene, but this will give us the total number of days if she worked on each type of scene separately. 

A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days for each type of scene or to work on the scenes in a combination that allows her to finish all the scenes in the least amount of time.

However, in this case, we can simply add the days for each type of scene and then check if there is a more efficient way to complete the scenes.

9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

However, Lauren can work on the scenes in a combination that allows her to finish all the scenes in 16 days. 

Day 1-6: 6 days for 36 medium scenes (6 * 6 = 36) and 6 * 5 = 30 large scenes (9 days for 45 large scenes - 3 days remaining for large scenes)
Day 7-9: 3 days for the remaining 15 large scenes (3 * 5 = 15) and 3 * 7 = 21 small scenes
Day 10-16: 7 days for the remaining 28 small scenes (7 * 4 = 28)

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first find the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. This is done by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability of both tickets winning = 0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs.

Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, to cover 100%, we need:
100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
- 3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
- 1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

All blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. 
To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

100 pods + (20% of 100 pods) = 100 + (0.2 * 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost of the new box:

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Initially, the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. This means 55% of the chalk is left.

Since the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can calculate the length of the chalk left after Monday:

5 inches * 0.55 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day. However, we should express this in terms of the percentage of the original 5-inch piece of chalk.

The teacher uses 20% of the original 5-inch piece of chalk per day, which is:

5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch per day

Now, we can calculate how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk:

2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days

However, since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles it when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the chalk until it is 2 inches long.

Let's calculate how much chalk the teacher will use until it is 2 inches long:

5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches

The teacher has already used 45% of the chalk, so we need to find out how much chalk is left in terms of the percentage of the original 5-inch piece of chalk:

5 inches - (5 inches * 0.45) = 2.75 inches

Now, we can calculate how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk until it is 2 inches long:

(2.75 inches - (5 inches - 2 inches)) / 1 inch per day = (2.75 - 3) / 1 is not possible since you cannot use a negative amount of chalk. We will instead use the 2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days and round down to 2 days since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day and will have to recycle the chalk on the next day.

However, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the next day after 2 days, so the teacher will have 2 days before he has to recycle this piece, plus the day he used it, which is Monday, so the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 3rd day after Monday, but the question asks how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece, so we will count only the days after Monday.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to find out how many gallons of milk were returned. Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we can calculate the amount returned as follows:

Total gallons of milk = 4000 gallons
Amount returned = 2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we can calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount returned by the cost per gallon:

Refund amount = Amount returned * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out the cost per book, we divide $500 by 100 books:

$500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find out the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book:

$27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can find out the number of books per school by dividing the total number of books by 3:

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To find out how many apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, so he now has 1 (from the previous step) + 5 (newly put in pocket) = 6 apples in his pocket. He threw the remaining 1 apple at the tree.
4. This caused 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has 6 (in his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 12 apples.

So, Newton brought home 12 apples."

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate will need to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 5 + 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15: 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay's snowballs accumulate. To do this, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 snowballs per minute - 2/15 snowballs per minute = (5/15 - 2/15) snowballs per minute = 3/15 snowballs per minute = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net accumulation rate to find the time it will take: 
60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute) = 60 * 5 minutes = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and 75 of those came from the third day's order. This means they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left from the first day.

However, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the first two days. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

Since they had 12 bandages left from the first day, they must have had 31 - 12 = 19 bandages at the start of the first day, in addition to the 50 they ordered.

Therefore, the total number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19 + 50 = 69.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600. So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of scotch plus the cost of cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. 

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
b = 3c - 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:
c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:
4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:
4c = 12

Divide by 4:
c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3. So, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie earns $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he earns:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he earns 75% of his standard rate, which is:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour
He has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so he earns:

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours he traveled in 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that Michael has covered (3600 km).

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. 
Total grapes = 36 (used by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (used by their mother) = 84 grapes.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books a single bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we can add the number of blue and yellow blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12 blocks.

Since there are 32 blocks in total, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total to find the number of red blocks: 32 (total) - 12 (blue and yellow) = 20.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Year 1 depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2 depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3 depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

The bag has 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the hotel stay is $80 per night for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel stay is:
$80 * 3 = $240

The cost of each bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is:
$80 * 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is:

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, we can calculate the distance Aaron ran as follows:

Distance Aaron ran = Distance Vanessa ran / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 4 miles / 2
Distance Aaron ran = 2 miles

Now, we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile as follows:

Time Aaron takes to run 1 mile = 8 minutes

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile is twice the time it takes Aaron to run one mile:

Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 2 * 8 minutes
Time Vanessa takes to run 1 mile = 16 minutes

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. 
Profit percentage is calculated on the cost price. 
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first find the current age of the youngest son. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so the current age of John is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the current age of the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor cost is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by dividing the second equation by 2 to simplify it:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total, including Henry. To share the slices equally, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.
