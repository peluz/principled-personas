"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings at the farmers' market are 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000. But the repairs cost $50,000, so the new value after repairs is $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed required is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount required: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows:
- 1st glass: $5
- 2nd glass: $3
- 3rd glass: $5
- 4th glass: $3
- 5th glass: $5
- 6th glass: $3

- 12th glass: $3
- 13th glass: $5
- 14th glass: $3
- 15th glass: $5
- 16th glass: $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- 8 glasses at $5 each: 8 * $5 = $40
- 8 glasses at $3 each: 8 * $3 = $24

Total cost = $40 + $24 = $64

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first find the number of sheep in each city.

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep:
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla has already downloaded 80 GB before the restart, so she doesn't need to download that part again. But since she has to restart the download from the beginning, we still consider the entire 100 minutes for the second part.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time before the restart (40 minutes), the time for the restart (20 minutes), and the time to download the entire file again (100 minutes). 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours.

In the first 2 hours, John was in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), John drove at 30 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drove at 80 mph. The distance covered in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

So, the total distance covered by John in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since John turned around and drove back, the distance he is from home is the difference between the initial distance and the distance covered in the 4 hours:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered in 4 hours = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total number of downloads over the three months: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first 5 years. However, in the 6th year, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108), but in the 7th year, the total revenue will be $63 + $10.50 = $73.50 and the total cost will be $108 + $3 = $111, and in the 8th year, the total revenue will be $73.50 + $10.50 = $84 and the total cost will be $111 + $3 = $114, and in the 9th year, the total revenue will be $84 + $10.50 = $94.50 and the total cost will be $114 + $3 = $117, and in the 10th year, the total revenue will be $94.50 + $10.50 = $105 and the total cost will be $117 + $3 = $120, and in the 11th year, the total revenue will be $105 + $10.50 = $115.50 and the total cost will be $120 + $3 = $123, and in the 12th year, the total revenue will be $115.50 + $10.50 = $126 and the total cost will be $123 + $3 = $126.

However, in the 12th year, the total revenue ($126) is equal to the total cost ($126), but in the 13th year, the total revenue will be $126 + $10.50 = $136.50 and the total cost will be $126 + $3 = $129.

So, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She then sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
So, the remaining vacuum cleaners are (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5
(x - x/3 - 2) * 2/2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5
(x - x/3 - 2) * (2 - 1)/2 = 5
(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5
x - x/3 - 2 = 10

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, she eats 3 eggs per day. In 28 days, she will eat 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165.

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we first need to determine her running and walking speeds.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in six hours, spending one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

"To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find the distance outside of the flames where she can still hit the dragon: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight by the number of servings:
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we multiply the weight per serving by the number of servings you can eat:
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total Revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total Cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total Cost = 2 * $10.00
Total Cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit.

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net Profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the total number of articles she wrote and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles Meredith wrote is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties and red ties he bought, and then calculate the total cost.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total cost by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost per red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

Total cost = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then find 3/4 of that number to determine the occupied units. The remaining units will be unoccupied.

Total number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8
Total units in the building: 15 * 8 = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
Occupied units = (3/4) * Total units
Occupied units = (3/4) * 120
Occupied units = 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

Eggs per week = 252 * 7 = 1764

Now, let's calculate the total number of dozens of eggs produced per week:
Dozens per week = 1764 / 12 = 147

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2
Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:
3 * 25 = 75 roses

Then, multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
75 * 8 = 600 thorns

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'L' and the number of games they won as 'W'. We know that the team played 22 games in total, so the sum of the games they won and lost is 22. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations:

W + L = 22 (total games played)
W = L + 8 (they won 8 more than they lost)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the total number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
Since she's completed 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% increase every year. 
After the first year (or 6th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$600 + 10% of $600 = $600 + $60 = $660

After the second year (or 7th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726

After the third year (or 8th year in the company), her monthly salary will be: 
$726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary: 
$798.60 * 12 = $9583.20

Now, divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as 3/4 of the total invited guests.

Expected attendees = 3/4 * 16 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Next, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. We can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
= 80

Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Now, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We can do this by dividing 64 by 16, which gives us 4. This means Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used. 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in this number. Since we are only interested in the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can say that the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Total pages = 39 

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract those from the total pages to find out how many pages are left.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday 
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 
Remaining pages = 24

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass. This makes a total of 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 7 = 27.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner dimensions of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length, width, and height to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

Cross-multiplying, we get:
16x = 64 * 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can find the amount of water the boat took on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were there initially, we subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the total: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was x + 5.

While making the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had left was x + 5 - 3.

We are given that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, the package Julia bought had 10 spoons.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to find out how many friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding Amy's friends and Lily's friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Converting total time to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Cost to the hospital (charged by doctors): 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000
Revenue from patients (charged by hospital): 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Profit made by the hospital: Revenue - Cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, after the first wave of quitting, the number of elves left is 60 - 20 = 40.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. 
The number of elves left is 40 - 10 = 30.

Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to find the total.

Total Expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total Expenditure = $500 + $440

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using S = 2B:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10 per gallon.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon:
Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can calculate the number of gallons they made:
Number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

According to the second statement, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, which is 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since this is Mark's age two years ago, Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

According to the first statement, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of favorable outcomes. Since Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6
= 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number in the first roll and then another even number in the second roll. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 0.5
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll.
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5
= 0.25

Now, we need to find the difference in the probabilities and express it as a percentage.
Difference in probabilities = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
= 0.5 - 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
Difference in probabilities (percentage) = 0.25 * 100

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters from the total straw given to the rats and hamsters to find the straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
Total slices for lunch = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
Total slices for breakfast = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Total slices of cheese used = Total slices for lunch + Total slices for breakfast + Total slices for dinner
Total slices of cheese used = 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices
Total slices of cheese used = 31 slices

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is:
22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is:
6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

Janet also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is:
2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of blue and red pens she bought:
32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, we consider the average of 5 tests. 

The desired average is 93, so the total score for 5 tests should be 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests: 
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the scores of the remaining 4 tests (89, 92, 100, and 86): 
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To achieve the desired total score of 465, we subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests from the desired total score: 
465 - 367 = 98.

So, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks and the distance covered in the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time. 
Distance covered in a week = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers
Distance covered in four weeks = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the next three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.
Distance covered in a week = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers
Distance covered in three weeks = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

The total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates at $6000 each is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of the plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is 240 cups (20 * 12), we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240 to find the cost of each cup: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first calculate the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Number of customers on the third day = Total number of customers by the third day - Total number of customers on the first two days
= 500 - 250
= 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We can set up the equation based on the given information: 
2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x - 4x = -64 + 16
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:
Small pool = x - 16
Small pool = 24 - 16
Small pool = 8

Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours = $352.00 / $8.00

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. The total amount is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount = $2000
Additional amount = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount = Initial amount + Additional amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay in 12 months is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance:
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

The average age of the three in three years is the sum of their ages divided by 3.
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:

Now, Ram has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the ink will run low in these 5 new pens as well. When that happens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens (the new pens) to make 1 full pen. So, from the 5 new pens, he can create 5 / 5 = 1 more new pen.

Now, Ram has 30 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

However, the ink will run low in this 1 new pen as well. When that happens, he won't have enough empty pens to create another new pen (he needs 5 empty pens to create 1 new pen).

"To determine the total number of books read, we need to consider the books each person reads.

Dolly has 2 books and reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book and reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Since they both read a total of 3 books each, the collective number of books read is 3 + 3 = 6.

However, this counts each book twice (once for each person), so we need to consider the actual number of unique books read. There are 3 unique books (2 from Dolly and 1 from Pandora).

The correct approach is to count the number of unique books read by each person. Dolly reads 3 unique books, and Pandora reads 3 unique books, but they read the same set of 3 unique books.

So, the collective number of unique books read is 3.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin was left with:
19 - 10 = 9

Then, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. But before that, Griffin had 9 fries and in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 27. This means before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had:
27 + 2 = 29

Now, we know that before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 29 fries, and before that, Griffin had 9 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is:
29 - 9 = 20

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation is: 28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work done and then apply the discount.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
The makeup work takes 6 hours per day, and it's done 4 times a week. 
So, the total hours per week is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours for the entire movie is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The total cost without discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so the discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Total cost = cost of cake ingredients + cost of birthday presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories her sister consumed = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. The total number of girls is also 30.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is:

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem states there are 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the cows. So, we assume there were 10 stalls initially, but after Mr. Sylas buys the cows, the cows are divided into 20 stalls.

Initially, 10 stalls have 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows is 200 (initial) + 40 (new) = 240 cows.

Since there are 20 stalls now, and each stall has an equal number of cows, we divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall: 240 / 20 = 12 cows per stall.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 12 * 8 = 96.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to account for the portion eaten by the termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal) and subtract the result from the total weight.

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have. 
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies Carla is making is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the total number of dozens. 
66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour Carla will need.
5.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row has 5 stars, divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of the flagstones, the answer is 3.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to determine the points each player has after the third round.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (by the oldest) + 4 (by the youngest) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed by his sons. 

15 - 12 = 3

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then add them together.

On the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

On the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities = 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the total weight of the bag by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week and subtract that from his target.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55 crates.

So, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total number of bids and the final bid amount. 

The bidding starts at $200. Three other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. So, the sequence of bids is as follows:
- Initial bid: $200
- 1st person bids: $200 + $50 = $250
- Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300
- 2nd person bids: $300 + $50 = $350
- Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = $400
- 3rd person bids: $400 + $50 = $450
- Carmen bids (and wins): $450 + $50 = $500

The desk costs Carmen $500.

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000
Total bonus given to the driver per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to calculate the total time he exercised on Sunday and Monday, then multiply that by 2.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
Total time on Sunday and Monday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.
Time on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a specific order (1 and 2 on the left, 31 and 32 on the right). This arrangement implies that the paper is folded in a way that creates 4-page sections (or signatures). 

In this case, we can divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 4
= 32 / 4
= 8

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. 
She also spent an additional $10 for rides. 
So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: 
$50 - $35 = $15

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Now, we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books she sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books she sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours per week is 10 * 5 = 50 hours.
His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500.
Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month is his monthly earnings from his hourly wage plus the total bonus. 
His monthly earnings from his hourly wage is $500 * 4 = $2000.
So, his total earnings for the month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

First, we find out how many people he beat: 80% of 20 is 0.8 * 20 = 16 people.

Since he arm-wrestled 20 people and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the sales process.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we have 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in a week, we can say that Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. 

Weight lost per 4 weeks by Sandy = 2 pounds.
Weight lost per week by Sandy = 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.

To lose 8 pounds, the number of weeks it will take Sandy = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and the discounted price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from ice cream and milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
Total expenses = cost of business suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount Theo has left after subtracting his total expenses and the amount he wants to save from his total budget: 
Amount left = Total budget - Total expenses - Amount to be saved

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + D + D/2) / 2 = 105 / 2
(9D/2) / 2 = 105 / 2
9D/4 = 105 / 2
9D = 105 * 2
9D = 210
D = 210 / 9
D = 70/3
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number that can be divided evenly by 3 (to account for the half on special teams), which is 21 for the defense, but that would leave a remainder when calculating the offense and special teams.

"To find the total number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and subtract the number of people who couldn't come.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- 2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12
- 3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

Now, let's subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 - 10 = 14

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:
Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost:
Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

Number of boys = 30

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, 
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
= 3 * 30
= 90

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys,
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole : 3 wires = x poles : 45 wires

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the number of women left, we first need to determine the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and in total, she has 26 pencils. 

Let's subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils Jam has: 26 - 2 = 24. This means Jam has 24 pencils in her 3 boxes. 

Now, let's divide the number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8. This means each box can hold 8 pencils.

Now, let's add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Finally, let's divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold to find out how many boxes they need: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to determine how many new records each person got on average, and then use the trade ratio to calculate the number of old records.

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can find the average number of new records per person by dividing 7 by 5. However, we don't need to do this calculation because we know the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.

Since 7 new records were obtained, and the trade ratio is 2:1, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2
Total old records = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The total number of employees is 100, and junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees. 
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. 
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. 
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000
Total amount paid to all programmers = $224,000

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1 person.

Now, let's subtract this net change from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 20 - 1 = 19.

This means that before the second stop, there were 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

These 14 people must have gotten on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining charge percentage and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, the time it will take to fully charge is 40% * 3 minutes/1% = 120 minutes.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

Applying the coupon, the final price becomes $39 - $8 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes:
Difference = Net income of Job B - Net income of Job A
= $32,400 - $24,000

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider Richard (or RJ) to have 1 gun.

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
Total number of guns = 24

Now, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we know that the smallest group has 'x - 10' students. So, the number of students in the smallest group is:

Divide both sides by 3:
c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (c = 20), we can find the number of chickens:
Number of chickens = 2c = 2 * 20 = 40

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. To find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and add them together:

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds

"To find the percentage increase in daily earnings, we first need to calculate the daily earnings when the factory made tractors and when it made silos.

Daily earnings when making tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Daily earnings when making silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, let's calculate the increase in daily earnings: 
Increase = New earnings - Old earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the increase by the old earnings and multiply by 100:
Percentage increase = (Increase / Old earnings) * 100 = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly cost of treats is $20.

The monthly cost of medicine is $100.

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total yearly cost is $220 * 12 = $2640.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number of plant pots she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, so they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Total plant pots needed = 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:

100 (plant pots bought) - 90 (plant pots needed) = 10

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3 * Total time = 15 hours
Total time = 15 / 0.3
Total time = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing. 
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * Total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the toys and then subtract that from the total amount of money he received from his mother.

Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the total cost of the toy cars is 6 x $2 = $12.
He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 x $1 = $5.
The total amount Dean spent on toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother and then got an extra $10, so the total amount of money he received is $28 + $10 = $38.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be $2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in a day and then divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the daily distance.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, which is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the daily distance: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21.

Then, we add the cards she received from family and friends: 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark, and the slices eaten by Jenny from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Mark already has $50 in his bank account, and he wants to buy a bike that costs $300. So, the total amount he needs to save is $300 - $50 = $250.

Mark earns $10 per day at his work. To find out how many days he needs to save, we divide the total amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10).

$250 / $10 = 25 days

"To find the total earnings of the builder in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. So, the total number of days he works in a month is:
4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

The builder gets paid $50 every day, so his total earnings in a year are:

"To determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day or 7.2 kilowatt-hours/day (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours)
Total energy in 30 days at original usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day or 2.7 kilowatt-hours/day
Total energy in 30 days at reduced usage: 2.7 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

Now, let's calculate the energy saved:
Energy saved = Total energy at original usage - Total energy at reduced usage
Energy saved = 216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours
Energy saved = 135 kilowatt-hours

There's a zebra with 36 stripes. 
Another zebra has half that many stripes, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Total number of stripes = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.
Total number of zebras = 4.

Average number of stripes = Total number of stripes / Total number of zebras = 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost per pound.

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to get the total cost.

Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the additional items he bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, the total number of corns is 80 + 60 = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he took before the jog. 

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps, and he has 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, the steps taken before and during the jog are 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the steps taken before the jog are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, to find out the steps taken during the jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before and during the jog. 
Steps taken during the jog = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs to leave before his desired arrival time is:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave for the airport:
50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes early

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

- Half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples
- An unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this 'x'

Her sister gathered:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples
- No apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine the constants:
30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150

Now the equation becomes:
150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:
x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

We know that each camel has one head and two humps, and each dromedary has one head and one hump. We are given that there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

We can set up two equations based on this information:

1. The total number of heads: c + d = 180
2. The total number of humps: 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations to find the number of dromedaries. 

First, let's isolate 'c' in the first equation: c = 180 - d

Now, substitute 'c' in the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304
Expanding the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304
Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304
Subtract 360 from both sides: -d = -56
Multiply both sides by -1: d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

In the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is:

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold and then add the cards he kept.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

Number of cards sold = Total amount made / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his original cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his original cards. Let's call the original number of cards 'x'. Then:

Number of cards sold = 2/3 * x
100 = 2/3 * x

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the guests who wanted two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the guests who only wanted one. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of a candy bar: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 / 4 = 5

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first determine the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total.

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces.

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, they ate 2 * 2.5 ounces = 5 ounces.

Now, subtract the weight of the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to reach the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width:
360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)) to find the perimeter:
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to baking and the temperature decrease due to opening the window.

The house's initial temperature is 40 degrees. 
Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour. 
So, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
The new temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature decreases by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. 
Since 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.
The final temperature after opening the window is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Final temperature: 49"
"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, 
- James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40) 
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 
- James' swim time = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, 
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
- James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. 
So, James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes 
- James' total time = 170 + 10 
- James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' time for the run: 
- James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time) 
- James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85) 
- James' run time = 180 - 121 
- James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The rest of the sneakers sold were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers. 
These were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the rest of the week:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The total cost is $576.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option and the regular ticket option.

The super ticket option costs $20 for the ticket and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda, so the total cost is $21.

Since you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so the total cost of the ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15.

To find the regular price of popcorn, subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $15 = $4.

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the original cost per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. 

Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in five days by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

x + x/2 + x/2 = 43 - 7
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects

And we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day.
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days, respectively. 
July has 31 days, but we only need to count up to July 19th, so we'll subtract 12 days from July's total.

Total days = 1 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) = 201 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we'll divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days:

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Total raisins for cookies / Raisins per batch
= 9 cups / (3/4 cup)
= 9 / 0.75

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The difference in weekly consumption is 2352 kilowatts/week - 2016 kilowatts/week = 336 kilowatts/week.

Since a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is 336 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take the same person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the total time it would take to paint a whole house would be:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

The total cost of the items Tom bought is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. To do this, we divide the cost of the headphone set ($44) by the cost of a CD ($4). 

$44 / $4 = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and add the hours spent in the weeks with the exceptions.

Josh spent 4 hours per week for 8 weeks, except for 3 weeks. So, he spent 4 hours per week for 5 weeks. 
Total hours spent in the 5 weeks with the usual routine = 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Now, let's calculate the hours spent in the weeks with exceptions. 
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so the total hours spent in those weeks = 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
- He spent 6 hours in one week.

Total hours spent in the weeks with exceptions = 10 + 6 = 16 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent in the weeks with the usual routine and the weeks with exceptions to find the total hours spent.
Total hours spent = 20 + 16 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame is currently 22 years old, in 8 years, he will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is half the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then calculate the total number of seashells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, each group has 20 / 2 = 10 kids. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells the boys brought is 10 * 60 = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine his total savings for the month and then calculate the daily savings for the first and second half.

Elvis' monthly savings target is $1125. April has 30 days. 

Let's assume the daily savings for the first half is 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings for the second half will be '2x'.

The first half of the month has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days. 

The total savings for the month can be represented as:
15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since the daily savings for the second half is '2x', we multiply 'x' by 2:
2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 + 2 * 16 = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day, we can't directly calculate the time. But we can assume that the time it takes on a hot day is the same as on a warm day, as there's no other information provided.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, on a cold day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a warm/hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, on a warm/hot day, Ray swims 3 miles in 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many action figures Peter can buy, we first need to determine how much he spent from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day for a week, we can calculate his daily budget by dividing his total money by 7.

Daily budget = Total money / 7
Daily budget = $70 / 7
Daily budget = $10

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he bought 2 wooden action figures each day.

Number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday through Wednesday = 2 * 4 = 8

The total amount spent on wooden action figures = 8 * $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left for the rest of the week.

Money left = Total money - Money spent on wooden action figures
Money left = $70 - $40
Money left = $30

Since he will spend an equal amount each day, his remaining budget for Thursday through Saturday is $10 per day. He will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Number of plastic action figures bought on Thursday = $10 / $2 = 5
Number of plastic action figures bought on Friday = $10 / $2 = 5
Number of plastic action figures bought on Saturday = $10 / $2 = 5

Total number of plastic action figures bought = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15

Total number of action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures
Total number of action figures = 8 + 15
Total number of action figures = 23

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- First flower shop: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week
Total roses ordered per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy had brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups

Original price of 1 box: $100.00
Discount: 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Total cost of 2 boxes: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, the total number of contacts in 2 boxes is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
Total cost of 2 boxes: $180.00
Total number of contacts: 180
Cost per contact: $180.00 / 180 = $1.00

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost per pair of contacts is:

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. 

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months. 

The additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. The funding for these months is 50% more than the initial funding per month. The initial funding per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 50% more than this is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost of the additional 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the additional months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, so he needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 inches to reach the required height.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the number of inches he needs to grow (8) by his growth rate (2 inches per year) to find out how many years it will take him to reach the required height.

8 / 2 = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are:

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

Number of days to finish the book = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 200 pages / 10 pages/day
= 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Number of days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish the book
= 30 days - 20 days
= 10 days

"To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly hanger rental cost: $5,000
Monthly fuel cost: 2 * $5,000 = $10,000
Total monthly cost: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000
Total cost for the first year: $150,000 + ($15,000 * 12) = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70. This can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

Sheep and geese both have one head. The total number of animal heads is 20. This can be represented as:
s + g = 20

We can solve these two equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Divide both sides by 2 to find 's':
s = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 
20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he buys 7 pounds of coffee.
The cost of 7 pounds of coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

Total high chairs required = 15 (given that there are 15 babies)
Total regular chairs required = 42 (given that there are 42 adults)

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people, which is Aiden and his friends. Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet 7 more friends at the cinema. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks. The total number of drinks and snacks is:
Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) is:
Total items = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items

Each item costs $2. The total amount spent is:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the hauling capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We also know the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find the hauling capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total combined capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

"To find the speed of Martha's turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5 since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%: 
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 2 hours by 24 (48 hours / 2 hours).

Quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 100 quarts * 24 = 2400 quarts

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 4 hours by 12 (48 hours / 4 hours).

Quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts * 12 = 600 quarts

Area to be covered = 2 * 12 sq ft
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. To find the total number of tiles needed, we can multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

Total tiles needed = Area to be covered * Tiles per square foot
Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft
Total tiles needed = 576 tiles

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost plus the cost per pound. 
Initial cost: $20
Cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30
Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
Total cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store.
Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
Total pounds: 30
Total cost of buying at the store = Cost per pound * Total pounds
Total cost of buying at the store = $2.5 * 30
Total cost of buying at the store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

Total number of animals: 
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses
Total = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

"To find the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he got.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards is the sum of the values of the individual cards. 
- The card worth $4000
- The card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so 30 * $50 = $1500

The total value of the cards is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit Mark made is the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs. 
Profit = Total value of cards - Total cost of packs
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

"To find out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for both parks and then find the difference.

For the first amusement park:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $28
- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two parks:
$76 (first park) - $48 (second park) = $28

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. 
The original cost per tomato was $.5, so the original daily cost is 500 * $.5 = $250.
The new cost per tomato is $.4, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.
The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we first need to find out how many marbles each of them has.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. To find Cal's marbles, we can calculate:
Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To find the number of groups needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get the number of students per group.

54 / 6 = 9 students per group

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, given that each group should have 9 students.

54 / 9 = 6 groups

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for a total count. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

In total, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we first need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the first house needs x/2 shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x shingles.

We know the total number of shingles is 250. So, we can set up the equation: 
x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms: 
(1/2)x + 2x = 250
(5/2)x = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90
Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we first need to determine how much money she spent on the candy bars. 

Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, so the amount of money she had left is $80 - $20 = $60.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can find the number of candy bars she bought by dividing the amount of money she spent on candy bars ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5).

Number of candy bars = $60 / $5 = 12

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the books Ezra read initially (300) and the additional books he decided to read (150) to find his total. 
Ezra's total = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals.
Total books read = Ezra's total + Ahmed's total = 450 + 150 = 600 books.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find her total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling corn: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25): $75 / 25 = $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

Time spent driving to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time spent driving to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time spent driving to the museum = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back home
Total time spent driving = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time spent driving = 4 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = Total time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the total cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies will be 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Total cost of series movies = 200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5. Let's calculate the number of older movies:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies
Total cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10. Let's calculate the number of normal movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
Total cost of normal movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours (since they hiked for 1.5 hours). 

Distance driven = Speed * Time 
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours 
Distance driven = 225 miles

Now, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour

Distance hiked = Speed * Time 
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the remaining time on the timer.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. Then Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. 
Points from enemies for Emma = 10x
Points from enemies for Ava = 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Then Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.
Points from berries for Emma = 5y
Points from berries for Ava = 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Then Ava finishes the level with 'z - 4' seconds left.
Points from time for Emma = 30z
Points from time for Ava = 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for Emma and Ava:
Total points for Emma = 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava = (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava = 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their two scores = Total points for Ava - Total points for Emma

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but since it is given that two pizzas cost 30 dollars, it is 30 dollars for two pizzas, so the total is 30 dollars).

Now, subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas:

On the usual days (5 days), they ride thrice a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

On the extra days (2 days), they ride twice the usual number of times, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

The total number of rides in a week is the sum of the rides on the usual days and the extra days: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought 17 fish in total, the number of orange fish he bought would be 17 - x.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + 17 - x) orange fish and (4 + x) white fish.

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is now twice the number of white fish. We can set up the equation:

(3 + 17 - x) = 2 * (4 + x)

Combine like terms:
20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can first divide both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Overall pass rate: 70%"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, the total number of chips he has is 2 * 72 = 144.

Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, the total number of square inches he can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we need to divide the total number of square inches by the height. 

Length = Total square inches / Height
Length = 12 / 3
Length = 4

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining tea to the total amount consumed, we get:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies, but since he didn't have them, he must have ordered more. After selling 150, he ordered 100 more. 

So, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

Since he has already sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell the remaining candies. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches:

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals initially: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals initially: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows.

Marshmallows left = 35 (original) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the marshmallows left is equal to the number of marshmallows left. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'z'. 

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:
z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10

Combine like terms:
10z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
z = 1

Now that we know z, we can find the amount of oil:
Amount of oil = 4z = 4 * 1 = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sells. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away to his mother. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has left. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

$125,000 (from students) / 20 (number of students) = $6,250

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has: 3x = 3 * 47 = 141.

Finally, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, the number of socks Jack has is half the number of dishes. So, Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. So, the total interest earned in 3 years will be $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find half of the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half will not have collars. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to first determine the number of trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

We know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The discounted cost of 3 baskets of red food is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total is the sum of the homes built in the first two years (48) and the homes built in the third year (96), which is 48 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

I am 2 years older than my sister, so:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87:
A + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for A and M in terms of B into the equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
6B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
6B = 96

Divide by 6:
B = 16

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age:
A = B - 3
A = 16 - 3
A = 13

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack to find out how many packs are needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip per customer = $20
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20 = $800

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1.

10% of $800 = $800 * 0.1 = $80

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract $80 from $800.

Total tips for Julieta = $800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals.

Total tips = $800 + $720 = $1520

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first determine the total cost of the salad and the yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: 40 hours * $12 per hour = $480.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. In the first week, she made $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) = $24. In the following week, she made $6 (Joe) + $30 (Alba) = $36. However, we are not given that she mowed Joe's lawn in both weeks. We are only given that she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6. So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

Now, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount.

$80 (total) - $54 (mowing lawns) = $26.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in terms of child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

Time for a normal sudoku = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku = 4 * Time for a normal sudoku
Time for an extreme sudoku = 4 * 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks:

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John).

We are also given that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

We can substitute L = J + 10 into the equation P = L + J to get P = (J + 10) + J. This simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Now, we can substitute P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into the equation P + L + J = 100.

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L: L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Now that we know L and J, we can find P: P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's hay) - 3 pounds = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining earnings are:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining earnings are:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, his remaining earnings are:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining earnings by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gave away from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest hour, as the problem states ""or part thereof."" So, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, the amount he paid is 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 = 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) and B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can rewrite the equation as A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so his stapling rate is:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, the total number of occupied beds = 200 (initial) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

In the first segment, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

In the second segment, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the initial distance.

In the third segment, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the south direction and subtract the distance traveled in the north direction to find the net distance:
Net Distance = Distance (south) - Distance (north) + Distance (south)
Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil is 24 years old, and then calculate their current ages.

When Emil is 24 years old, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find their current ages. Emil is currently 19 years old, and he will be 24 in 5 years. So, we subtract 5 years from their ages at that time to find their current ages.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3:
21 / 3 = 7

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members
= 6 + 6
= 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants to find out how many plants Pat needs: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs 45 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 28 * 6 = $168 at the store.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines for each basket, then multiply by the number of baskets.

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 apiece, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 apiece, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:
90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her:
90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them:
15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the first 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling in the next 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then work backwards.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we first need to find the number of flights the second plane makes and then double it. The second plane makes 44 trips in a day. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size '2x', we can calculate the percentage as:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

Let's start with the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can calculate the charge at the beginning of these 3 hours as follows:

Let x be the charge at the beginning of the last 3 hours.
x - 3 * 7% of x = 28%
x - 0.21x = 28%
0.79x = 28%
x = 28% / 0.79
x = 35.44%

Now, let's consider the first 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. We know that the charge at the end of these 5 hours is 35.44%. We can calculate the initial charge as follows:

Let y be the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.
y - 5 * 9% of y = 35.44%
y - 0.45y = 35.44%
0.55y = 35.44%

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
40% of 60 questions = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult.
60% of 60 questions = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.

Total questions Aries is sure to get correct: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get $4 * 2L = $8 * L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: $12 * L + $8 * L = $120. Combining like terms, we get $20 * L = $120.

Dividing both sides by $20, we get L = 6. Since S = 2L, we can substitute L = 6 into the equation to get S = 2 * 6 = 12.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week is:
11 sandwiches per day * 7 days per week = 77 sandwiches per week

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day and then multiply it by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich and then multiply it by 8. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by 8: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability that the substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework is 50%.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 more bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we multiply the number of moves by the time per move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both amounts separately.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate the number of years it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the fabric piece by multiplying the new length and width.

Area of one fabric piece = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we'll subtract that from the total losses.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race) = $10.50

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of parking for 2 hours at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a day, we first need to find out how many emails don't require a response. 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 
64 * 5 = 320

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.7 = 14
Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Total number of pizzas left = 6 (from the glee club) + 8 (from the football team) = 14

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:
Number of trucks that failed = 1/4 * Total number of trucks
= 1/4 * 20
= 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
Number of trucks that delivered = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying:
Total tons of fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that delivered * Tons of fertiliser per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300 tons

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total bananas eaten in a day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

45 bananas per day - 24 bananas per day = 21 bananas per day

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount she paid.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost by first buying a dozen (12 roses) for $15 and then buying the remaining 3 roses at $2 each.

Cost of 12 roses: $15
Cost of 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6
Total cost: $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves at 125 minutes as well.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
Total toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect.
Toothpicks needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
Number of weeks = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then find the percentage discount:
Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total time it took James to reach the store by dividing the total distance by his walking speed (4 miles per hour).

Time = Total Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Growth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

"To find the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

1. Time spent in class per day: 
   There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 8 classes per day. 
   Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

2. Time spent in class per week: 
   Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

3. Extra learning time on weekends: 
   John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday. 
   First, we need to find the total weekly minutes: 1600 minutes (in class) / 15 (since 1/16 of the total time is spent on weekends, the in-class time is 15/16 of the total) = 1600 * 16 / 15 = 1706.67 minutes per week.
   Now, we can find the extra learning time on weekends: 1706.67 * 1/16 = 106.67 minutes per day on weekends. 
   Since there are 2 weekend days, the total extra learning time is 106.67 * 2 = 213.33 minutes.

4. Total time spent learning per week: 
   The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends: 1600 + 213.33 = 1813.33 minutes.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother) and 6 are unshaken.

The probability of selecting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

So, Billy takes 10 days off and works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 (discount)
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 (discount)
Set of towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance on credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, and 6 jellyfish changed color. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * large jellyfish = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3 to isolate the number of large jellyfish:

large jellyfish = 6 * 3
large jellyfish = 18

Now, we know that a fifth of the total jellyfish are large. We can set up the equation:

(1/5) * total jellyfish = 18

Multiplying both sides by 5 to isolate the total number of jellyfish:

total jellyfish = 18 * 5
total jellyfish = 90

Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she needs to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she wants to retire in 20 years, we can calculate the number of years she has already worked as follows:

Number of years already worked = Total years to reach goal - Years until retirement
= 40 years - 20 years
= 20 years

However, the problem asks for how many more years she needs to work, which is the years until retirement.

Number of years she needs to work = 20 years"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. 
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts. 
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we first need to determine the total population based on the given percentage of boys. 

Since 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

40% of total population = 240
0.4 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we divide both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total miles she can cover with her current plan and then compare it to her target.

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This means she will cover 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June, let's assume June has 30 days. With her current plan, she will cover 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

However, her target is 9,300 miles. To find the total miles she needs to cover per day to meet her target, we divide the target miles by the number of days: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since she already plans to cover 250 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily miles to find the additional miles she needs to hike per day: 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so the total amount of money he had is $21 + $11 = $32.

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
To do this, we divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we calculate the distance of the one-way trip. We know the time taken (2 hours) and the speed (70 mph), so we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's assume Sarah painted 'x' eggs. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation as:
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together all four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 = 25 pounds.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time taken on the beach = Distance / Speed
Time taken on the beach = 2 miles / x
Time taken on the beach = 40 minutes (given)

We can set up an equation using the given time:

x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time taken on the sidewalk:
Time taken on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time taken on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2x)
Time taken on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20)
Time taken on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10)

Let's say Bob currently has 'x' marbles. If he receives 24 more marbles, he will have x + 24 marbles. According to the problem, x + 24 = 60. 

To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 
x + 24 - 24 = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The temperature of the mixture is the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters. We can set up the following equation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women initially on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

(9/14) * 84 = 54 women initially on the bus.

Now, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women:

54 - 20 = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 * 3 = 39

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
7 * 12 = 84

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:
84 * 3 = 252

Now, let's add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:
39 + 252 = 291

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 to invest in the rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total investment by the cost per rock:

$100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7 per rock = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$100 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the individual days required for each type of scene, but this would assume she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done. A more efficient approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days required for each type of scene or to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days.

A more efficient approach is to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days. We can do this by working on the scenes with the highest number of days required first.

9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) is not the correct approach. Instead, we can work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days by working on the scenes with the highest number of days required first and then use the remaining days to work on other scenes.

One way to do this is to work on the large scenes for 9 days (completing 45 large scenes and having 0 days of large scenes left), then work on the medium scenes for 6 days (completing 36 medium scenes and having 0 days of medium scenes left, and also completing 6 * 5 = 30 large scenes if she were drawing large scenes, but she isn't, so we have 3 days of large scenes that were already completed), and finally work on the small scenes for 7 days (completing 49 small scenes, and having 0 days of small scenes left, and also completing 7 * 5 = 35 large scenes if she were drawing large scenes, but she isn't, so we have 2 days of large scenes that were already completed, and 7 * 6 = 42 medium scenes if she were drawing medium scenes, but she isn't, so we have 0 days of medium scenes left and 1 day of medium scenes that were already completed).

However, a more efficient way to do this is to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total days by working on the scenes with the highest number of days required first and then use the remaining days to work on other scenes.

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $50.

2. He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. The amount earned from this sale is $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land. Abraham initially had 80 square meters. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 3 times the initial amount = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the production of the 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total production:
- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits
- The first 4 years are not mentioned, so we assume they produce 0 fruits each.

Total production = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $100 * 1/5 = $20.

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
Red rope = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. After giving x dollars, Ronnie is left with $5 - x dollars, and Rissa is left with $15 - x dollars.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

Total paint used = 12 pints
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints
Non-yellow paint (red, white, and purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the non-yellow paint by 3.

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is $12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod.
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 pods.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
Number of 20 dollar bills = 1000 / 20 = 50

He loses 10 bills while getting home. 
Remaining 20 dollar bills = 50 - 10 = 40

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. 
Number of 20 dollar bills used = 40 / 2 = 20
Remaining 20 dollar bills = 40 - 20 = 20

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills = 20 * 20 = 400 dollars

Thomas then triples his money. 
New amount = 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. 
Number of 5 dollar bills = 1200 / 5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, so the amount of chalk used is:
5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

The amount of chalk left is:
5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how much chalk is left that can be used:
2.75 inches - 2 inches = 0.75 inches

However, we are interested in the total amount of chalk left, not just the usable amount. So we will use the total amount of chalk left (2.75 inches) for our calculations.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day. To do this, we will divide the remaining chalk by the amount used per day.

First, we need to find the amount of chalk used per day in inches:
5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch per day (this is the amount of chalk used per day when the teacher uses 20% of a new piece of chalk)
However, since the teacher is using a partially used piece of chalk, we need to find 20% of the remaining chalk:
2.75 inches * 0.20 = 0.55 inches per day

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk by the amount used per day:
2.75 inches / 0.55 inches per day = 5 days

However, the teacher already used the chalk for 1 day (Monday), so we need to add 1 to the total number of days:
5 days + 1 day = 6 days - 1 day (Monday is already counted as a day) = 5 days - 1 day (Monday is already counted as a day) + 1 day = 5 days 

However, the teacher will run out of usable chalk before the 5th day. On the 5th day, the teacher will have 2 inches of chalk left and will use 0.55 inches of chalk. So the teacher will have 2 - 0.55 = 1.45 inches of chalk left on the 5th day. On the 6th day, the teacher will use 0.55 inches of chalk and will have 1.45 - 0.55 = 0.9 inches of chalk left. On the 6th day, the teacher will still have more than 2 inches of chalk left if we include the 0.9 inches of chalk left and the 2 inches of chalk that the teacher cannot use. However, the teacher will run out of usable chalk on the 6th day if we only count the usable chalk.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

For cheese pizzas, each pizza has 12 slices. To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, divide the total number of cheese slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 slices. 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizzas, each pizza has 8 slices. To find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, divide the total number of pepperoni slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 slices. 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 5 + 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 4/15 snowballs per 5 minutes or 4/75 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 4/75 = (25 - 4) / 75 = 21/75 snowballs per minute.

To find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate:
60 / (21/75) = 60 * 75 / 21 = 3000 / 21 = 285.71 minutes ≈ 286 minutes (rounding up since you can't have a fraction of a minute for this problem), but we can convert this to hours and minutes for better understanding.

286 minutes ≈ 4 hours and 46 minutes.

However, the question asks for the time in a numerical format, so we will provide the answer in minutes.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can calculate Jim's age at that time.

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24 years old

"To find out how many slices of apple they all ate, we need to calculate the slices eaten by each person and add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all of them: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means that before the third day's order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages. So, before the first day's order, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left from the second day, and 31 + 38 = 69 bandages used and left from the first day. Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week. So, the total additional amount is $10 * 4 = $40.

Jen's total earnings for April is $270 + $40 = $310.

- He did his laundry once at $3.00, so he earned $3.00 from laundry.
- He took the trash out twice at $0.75 each, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50 from taking the trash out.
- He cleaned his room once at $1.50, so he earned $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add the total amount earned from each task: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $9.00.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens Alain has: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

Loan amount = 0.4 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount:
Amount used to pay debt = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay debt = 0.6 * $100,000

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height: 
Volume = base area * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 80% of the jar's volume:
Actual volume = 540 * 0.8 
Actual volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the actual volume by the volume of a single jelly bean:
Total jelly beans = Actual volume / Volume of a jelly bean 
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

3 magazines * 12 issues/year = 36 issues/year

Next, let's calculate the number of issues from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
1 magazine * 6 issues/year = 6 issues/year

Now, let's calculate the number of issues from the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
4 * 6 issues/year = 24 issues/year

Finally, let's add up the total number of issues from all the magazines:
36 issues/year + 6 issues/year + 24 issues/year = 66 issues/year

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he earns:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour

He has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so he earns:
2 hours * $60/hour = $120

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is the sum of the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran:
$320 + $120 = $440

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he was left with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. Now, he is left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours he traveled in 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that Michael has covered.

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and the number of grapes used by their mother.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we can find the total number of grapes at the beginning by adding the number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms and then the time spent per day.

Total time spent cleaning all classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes
Total time spent cleaning all classrooms in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, the time spent per day = 20 hours / 5 days = 4 hours per day

Now, we need to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms. 
The custodian works 8 hours a day, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms = (4 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books a single bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books a single bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

Original cost per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Total cost per bag after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100.

$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks per bag to find the cost per stick.

Number of sticks per bag: 30
Cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests. 

The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 
Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we calculate 70% of 110, which is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

On the first test, she got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 
So, 77 - 42 = 35.

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5s - 4

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There is a flashlight for every person (4 people) and two for each room (8 rooms). 
Number of flashlights for people = 4
Number of flashlights for rooms = 8 * 2 = 16
Total number of flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 
Number of rooms with small candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Number of rooms with medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20

Dallas initially received 21 (remaining marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles.

Now, we know Mazie had 52 marbles and gave 25 to Dallas. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Marbles given to Dallas
Marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25
Marbles given to Darla = 27

- 1 child ticket = $8
Total ticket cost = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of the popcorns: 
- 2 popcorns = 2 * $3 = $6

"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children. 

Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
Weight of the two children: 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds
Total weight: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01.

Force = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs John needs to buy is 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we can divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8, and the second T-shirt costs 50% of $8, which is $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discount is $16, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance Vanessa did. So, Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles. So, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed. So, Vanessa's speed is (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we know Vanessa's speed and the distance she ran. We can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance by her speed.

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
