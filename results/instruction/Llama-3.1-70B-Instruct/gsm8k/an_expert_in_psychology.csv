"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. 

First, we need to find out how many eggs are left after she eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins with four. 

Total eggs laid per day: 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7
Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9

Now, we can calculate the amount of money she makes by selling the eggs at the farmers' market.

Number of eggs sold: 9
Price per egg: $2
Total money made: 9 * $2 = $18

"To determine the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber needed and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house after repairs and compare it to his total investment.

Josh's initial investment is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house was $80,000. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5 (250%): $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

Now, we subtract Josh's total investment from the new value to find his profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a single session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per week.

In a single session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters in a single session is:
3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in a day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken receives per day. 

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals per day. So, each chicken receives 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 9 = 180 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed per day.

180 (total amount of feed needed per day) - 40 (amount of feed given in the first two meals) = 140 cups.

The answer is: 140"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of the subsequent glasses. 

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3. 

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide the 16 glasses into pairs, with the first glass in each pair costing $5 and the second glass costing $3. There are 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost of the first glass in each pair is 8 * $5 = $40.
The cost of the second glass in each pair is 8 * $3 = $24.

The total cost of the 16 glasses is $40 + $24 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to first determine the number of sheep in each city.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. We can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle
Total = 160 + 80 + 20
Total = 260

"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The total time it takes to download the entire 200 GB file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, Carla already spent 40 minutes downloading 80 GB before the restart, and she has to download the entire file again. So, the total time spent downloading is 40 minutes (before the restart) + 100 minutes (to download the entire file again) = 140 minutes.

Additionally, Carla has to spend 20 minutes on the Windows update. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes (download time) + 20 minutes (update time) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covered during those 4 hours and subtract it from the distance he initially drove away from home.

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance he covered is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he covered during the 4 hours he tried to get home.

He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance.

Then, he drove for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drove for the remaining time, which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance he covered during the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120
Total Distance = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance he covered during the 4 hours from the distance he initially drove away from home:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Total Distance
Distance from home = 180 - 135
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours. 

Eliza worked 45 hours this week. The first 40 hours are considered regular hours, and the remaining 5 hours are considered overtime hours.

For the regular hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. So, her earnings for the regular hours are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Subtracting 54 from 180 gives us 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we can add the number of downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.50 * 3 = $31.50

We can see that the total revenue is increasing by $10.50 each year, while the total cost is increasing by $3 each year. To find the break-even point, we can set up an equation:

Total revenue = Total cost
10.50x = 90 + 3x

where x is the number of years.

Solving for x, we get:

10.50x - 3x = 90
7.50x = 90
x = 12

However, this is the break-even point, not the point at which Carlos starts earning money. To start earning money, the total revenue must be greater than the total cost. This will happen in the next year.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling some at the orange house. Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she had 10 vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house (5 * 2 = 10).

Before the orange house, she had sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than at the green house. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house as x. Then, she sold x + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.

Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is 3x.

Now, let's calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners she had before the orange house: 
- She sold x vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- She sold x + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
- So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she had before the orange house is 3x - x - (x + 2) = x - 2.

We know that the total number of vacuum cleaners she had before the orange house is 10. Therefore, x - 2 = 10, and x = 12.

Since the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is 3x, she started with 3 * 12 = 36 vacuum cleaners, but we also need to add the 2 extra vacuum cleaners she sold at the red house, so she started with 36 + 2 = 38, but that is not correct, we only need to add the 2 to the x, not the 3x, so 3 * 12 is correct.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance: 
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance enrollment: 
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance (the rest of the students): 
20 - 4 (contemporary) - 4 (jazz) = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: 
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the potential profit from each option, we need to calculate the expected increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Expected increase = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Expected value at the end of the month = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Expected increase = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
Expected value at the end of the month = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option with the highest expected value at the end of the month. In this case, the electronic gadgets have a higher expected value ($8,096) than the jewelry ($5,125). However, the profit is the difference between the expected value and the initial value.

Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96
Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in both directions. 

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since the directions are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance traveled. However, in this case, we are looking for the total distance covered, not the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled in both directions. 

Total distance = Distance traveled westward + Distance traveled northward
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time period.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she consumes 3 eggs per day. 

In 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. To find the remaining time, we subtract the time she has already spent from the total time.

Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

Now, we need to find the remaining distance. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 miles per hour

Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of gold and silver coins is equal to 110. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since 'x' represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30', which is 40 + 30 = 70.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his Lego sets and then compare it to the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * $15 = $195.

He then spent $20 each on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * $20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can infer that he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 on video games and other possible expenses. However, we know he spent $160 on video games, so the remaining $30 ($190 - $160) must have been spent on other possible expenses or he had $30 initially.

However, the question does not provide any information about John having any money initially or spending money on other things. Therefore, we can assume that he spent the $30 on the video games or other expenses is not relevant to the question.

Since John spent $160 on video games and had $5 left, he must have made $165 from selling his Lego sets. 

Now, we can calculate the number of Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he made ($165) by the price of each Lego set ($15). 

165 / 15 = 11

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week. 

He runs 3 days a week. The first day, he runs 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's walking and running speeds. 

We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first determine the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. We can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, so we multiply 400 by 3 to get the new distance: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from Polly's new throwing distance (1200 feet) to find out how far outside of the flames she can stand: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that were available. Since Grandma Jones cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces can be calculated by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie.

Total number of pieces = Number of pies * Number of pieces per pie
Total number of pieces = 5 * 8
Total number of pieces = 40

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

Number of pieces taken = Total number of pieces - Number of remaining pieces
Number of pieces taken = 40 - 14
Number of pieces taken = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. 

Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining calories.

Number of servings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving
= 200 / 250
= 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the weight of one serving as follows:

Weight per serving = Total weight / Number of servings
= 300g / 5
= 60g per serving

Now, we can calculate the weight of 0.8 servings:

Weight = Weight per serving * Number of servings
= 60g * 0.8
= 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Net profit: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes she had left is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought and then calculate the number of red ties he bought. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties he bought by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so we can calculate the cost of each red tie by adding 50% of the cost of each blue tie to the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of Cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors with 8 units each, the total number of units is:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:

Number of occupied units = Total units * (3/4)
= 120 units * (3/4)
= 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Number of unoccupied units = Total units - Number of occupied units

"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Finally, we multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to determine the total amount Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Distance = Speed * Time. 
Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance is:
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 mph. 
Time = Distance / Speed.
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, which is 6 * $60 = $360. The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each, which is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, which is 12 * $40 = $480. Since the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, we see that the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday ($480) than on Thursday ($520 is actually more than $480). However, the question asks for the difference in revenue between the two days. The day with higher revenue is Thursday ($520), and the difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the year into two halves. 

The first half of the year consists of 6 months. Since Aleena was charged the initial amount of $140 per month, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
6 months * $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To calculate the reduced monthly charge, we need to find 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount:
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Reduced monthly charge = $140 - $14 = $126

The total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
6 months * $126/month = $756

"To find out how many liters of water were left, we need to first calculate the amount of water the girls got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we multiply 24 by 1/6 for each girl.

24 * 1/6 = 4 liters per girl
Since there are two girls, we multiply 4 by 2.
4 * 2 = 8 liters

Now, we subtract the amount of water the girls got (8 liters) and the amount the boy got (6 liters) from the total amount of water (24 liters).
24 - 8 - 6 = 10

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 stickers for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he had is:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. The total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, we subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find their combined weights, we first need to determine Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

Alex's weight = (4 * Grace's weight) - 2
Alex's weight = (4 * 125) - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498

Now, we can find their combined weights by adding Grace's weight and Alex's weight:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75 roses
Then, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600 thorns

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost plus the number of games they drew (if any) equals 22.

However, we are not given any information about the number of games they drew. For simplicity, let's assume they didn't draw any games, so the total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost.

We are also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write this as an equation: W = L + 8.

We know that W + L = 22 (since we're assuming no draws). We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by using the equation W = L + 8: W = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and then add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her annual salary after the 10% increase each year.

Initial monthly salary: $600
Initial annual salary: $600 * 12 = $7,200

After 1 year (10% increase):
New monthly salary: $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $600 + $60 = $660
New annual salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920

After 2 years (10% increase on the new salary):
New monthly salary: $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $660 + $66 = $726
New annual salary: $726 * 12 = $8,712

After 3 years (10% increase on the new salary):
New monthly salary: $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
New annual salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Annual salary after three more years of service: $9,583.20"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the number of gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the expected number of attendees. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Expected attendees = Total invited guests * (1 - 1/4)
Expected attendees = 16 * (1 - 0.25)
Expected attendees = 16 * 0.75
Expected attendees = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags = Expected attendees * 0.75
However, since she invited 16 friends, we should use the total invited guests for this calculation.
Total gift bags = 16 * 0.75
Total gift bags = 12

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
Total cost = 12 * 2
Total cost = 24

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults will eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to establish the age relationships between the siblings. 

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

Given that there are two cats for every dog and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. 

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we can calculate:
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of canned tomatoes she started with. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the original volume of the canned tomatoes must be double the volume of the sauce. 

The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the canned tomatoes by the volume of each can. 

Number of cans = Total volume of canned tomatoes / Volume of each can
Number of cans = 64 / 16
Number of cans = 4

Now, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes in each can.

Total number of tomatoes = Number of cans * Number of tomatoes per can
Total number of tomatoes = 4 * 3
Total number of tomatoes = 12

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 (total number of cars that drove through) - 20 (cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes) = 5.

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with one of his weekend dinners, but since he has soda with the other dinner, we add 1 more glass of water to the total weekend count. So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 6 + 1 = 7.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week: 20 + 7 = 27.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are there in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 sections

Since the fog bank covers 1 section (3 miles) in 10 minutes, it will cover 14 sections in 14 * 10 minutes.

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days and subtract that from the total time he spent watching TV.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes). 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode (90 / 30 = 3).

The total cost of the gas is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased. 
Total cost = $3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback amount is the cashback per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons purchased. 
Cashback = $0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore and then find out how much water the boat took on for that distance.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can set up a proportion using the given time and distance. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the distance she rows per second: 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, we can find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore by multiplying the time it took her to reach the shore (64 seconds) by the distance she rows per second (1.25 feet per second):
64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we can divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2:
80 feet / 10 feet * 2 liters = 16 liters.

1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Divide both sides by 6 to find Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we know that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let's set up another equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * Number of birds

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the original cost of the lumber and the selling price after the 50% increase.

Original cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $10/board = $100
Original cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16/board = $80
Total original cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new selling price will be 150% of the original cost.

New selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10/board * 1.5 = $15/board
New selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16/board * 1.5 = $24/board

Total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
Total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24/board = $120

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's initial salary, then calculate Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as L. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's initial salary as 1.3L. We are given that Adrien's initial salary was $40000. 

So, 1.3L = 40000
L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30769.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is 1.4 times his initial salary.
Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we assume the same rate of increase for Lylah. However, the problem doesn't specify the rate of increase for Lylah. Assuming the same rate of increase (40%) for Lylah as for Adrien, we can calculate Lylah's new salary.
Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 43078 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Now, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael: 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours per day. So, for these two days, she slept 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day. There are 4 days in this period, so she slept 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept throughout the week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. To find the distance covered in this segment, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance covered in this segment, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that number from the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile.

Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps. She put stamps on one-third of these letters. To find one-third of 60, we can divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile. To find out how many letters were in this pile initially, we subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile.

30 (total already-stamped) - 20 (letters Jennie stamped) = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of spoons she had when setting the table.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as x.

We know that Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before setting the table was x + 5.

However, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons she had when setting the table was x + 5 - 3.

We are given that the total number of spoons Julia had when setting the table was 12. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought was 10.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to first determine the number of fish sausages he bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy made. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends they have together by adding the number of friends each of them made:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity he is buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
3 * $15 = $45

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - $5 = $40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to first determine the total time spent by the doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day. To find the total time spent by the doctors, we need to convert the time per patient to hours and multiply it by the number of patients.

24 minutes per patient / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours per patient
0.4 hours per patient * 500 patients = 200 hours per day

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:
200 hours per day * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, and the total time spent by the doctors is 200 hours per day. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total time by the hourly charge:
200 hours per day * $200 per hour = $40,000 per day

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40,000 per day - $30,000 per day
Profit = $10,000 per day

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Since there were 60 elves initially, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, after the first wave of quitting, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. 

Now, we subtract the 10 elves who quit from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for June first. Since his expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, we subtract $60 from his May expenditure.

May expenditure: $500
June expenditure: $500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to find the total.

Total expenditure = May expenditure + June expenditure
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, Pam and Fred took 4 + 6 = 10 rides. 
Since each ride cost 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) by 6.

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 miles * 6 = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles) to get the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles

We are given that Walt's total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 miles - 28 miles
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13 miles

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian had before he lost 5. Brian had 20 video games but lost 5, so he originally had 20 + 5 = 25 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. Since Brian originally had 25 video games, we can multiply this number by 3 to find 3 times as many video games as Brian has: 25 * 3 = 75.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so we subtract 5 from 75: 75 - 5 = 70.

First, we know that one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. To find this number, we can divide 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find this number, we can multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered. 

The cost of the subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.
The cost of the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
The cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. 
Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items.
Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost.
Total cost with tip = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars available. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars: 
20 (total) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 (semi-automatic)

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is equal to 700: Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. So, before the ants took the fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries left.

A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Then, the raccoon stole (2/3)x fries, and (1/3)x fries remained. We know that (1/3)x = 6. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 3: x = 6 * 3 = 18. So, there were 18 fries before the raccoon stole some.

Before the raccoon, three pigeons ate three fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. Let's call the number of fries before the pigeons ate 'y'. Then, y - 9 = 18. 

To find 'y', we add 9 to both sides: y = 18 + 9 = 27. So, there were 27 fries before the pigeons ate.

Before the pigeons, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Let's call the number of fries before the seagull ate 'z'. Then, z - 7 = 27.

To find 'z', we add 7 to both sides: z = 27 + 7 = 34. So, there were 34 fries before the seagull ate.

Before the seagull, Dave ate 14 fries. Let's call the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'n'. Then, n - 14 = 34.

To find 'n', we add 14 to both sides: n = 34 + 14 = 48.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each person:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish caught is the sum of the fish caught by Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the price increase of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to break down the time period into 2-month intervals, as the price increases every 2 months.

36 months / 2 months = 18 intervals

The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the price increase every 2 months is $4.

Since there are 18 intervals, we can calculate the total price increase as follows:
$4 * 18 = $72

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the price after 36 months, as the price increase is 20% of the original price every 2 months, not a fixed amount.

To calculate the correct price, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

where A is the final price, P is the original price, r is the interest rate (20% in this case), and n is the number of intervals.

In this case, P = $20, r = 0.20, and n = 18.

However, since the interest rate is applied every 2 months, we need to adjust the formula to:
A = P * (1 + r)^n, where n is the number of 2-month intervals.

A = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
A = $20 * (1.20)^18
A = $20 * 55.9017
A ≈ $111.80

The final answer is: $112"
"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

We know that one red car costs $4, so the total cost of 5 red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

We also know that an action figure costs $5, so the total cost of 3 action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Now, let's add the cost of all the toys together: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of $35/hour * 3 hours = $105 in missed income.

On the other hand, hiring the accountant will cost her $90.

The difference between the two options is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

Total eggs required = 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'B' and Seth's current age as 'S'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age as S = 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2, and Seth's age will be S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

Seth's current age is 16.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total miles walked on weekends would be:
10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. 
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 insects. So, the total number of legs from insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

The rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them. So, the total number of legs from the invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts. 

The minimum monthly payments are as follows:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment.

50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the total yearly payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12.

Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To determine the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

The time to peel a potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut it is 5 seconds. To make the units consistent, we'll convert the time to peel to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds.

The total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Now, we multiply the time to prep one potato by the total number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

Their total revenue is $25 (profit) plus their total cost. Since we don't know the total cost yet, let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. 

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x. 

The revenue from 'x' gallons is 20x glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10x.

Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation: 
$10x (revenue) - $5x (cost) = $25 (profit)
$5x = $25
x = 5 gallons

For the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up. 

The first runner runs in 60 seconds. 
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. 
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. 
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to identify the favorable outcomes. Since the die is six-sided, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes for the first roll. Since the die is rolled again, the probability remains the same for the second roll. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each roll: (3/6) * (3/6) = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in likelihood, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

For breakfast, he ate cheese and egg omelets 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

He also used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the total slices used for each meal: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the number of green and yellow pens she already had.

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens to the initial number of pens: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98.

"To find the required score for Brinley to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the total score she needs for the five tests after removing the lowest score. 

Since there are six tests and she can remove the lowest score, we will consider the average of the five highest scores. The desired average is 93, and there are five tests considered for the average. 

The total score required for the five tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's calculate the total score of the four highest scores Brinley has so far, excluding the lowest score (71). 

The total score of the four highest scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Since we are excluding the lowest score (71), we need to find the score required for the sixth test that, when added to 367, will give us a total of 465 (the required total for the five highest scores).

The required score for the sixth test is 465 - 367 = 98.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down his riding into two phases.

Phase 1: Riding 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, for 4 weeks.
In one week, Micheal rode 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
In 4 weeks, Micheal rode 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Phase 2: Riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, for 3 weeks.
In one week, Micheal rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
In 3 weeks, Micheal rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers from both phases to get the overall total.
Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Now, let's calculate the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, each candied apple weighs:
40g / 2 = 20g

There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g. So, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 6 / 2 = 3 plates. The cost of each plate is $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $16800 / 240 = $70.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The jacket costs $30, and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. 

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Number of customers on the third day = Total number of customers by the third day - Total number of customers on the first two days
= 500 - 250
= 250

"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x'. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was '2x'.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the amount of water in the small pool is 'x - 16', and the amount of water in the big pool is '2x - 16'. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know 'x' (the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago), we can find the amount of water in the small pool now by subtracting the water lost due to the leak:

Amount of water in the small pool now = x - 16
= 24 - 16

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which includes the principal amount ($2000) and the additional 10% interest.

The interest amount is 10% of $2000, which is calculated as:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

The total amount Janeth owes is the principal amount plus the interest:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three in three years:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). The total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initially, James has:

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Their combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can calculate the time it will take to complete the puzzle by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his total weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his daily consumption is 6 tomatoes. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly consumption is 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

However, we also know that he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. This means his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is 42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To meet their combined weekly consumption, we need to divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced per vine per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of pens Ram buys and the number of new pens he can create by mixing the ink from empty pens.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. When the ink runs low, he has 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, so he can create 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
4. Now, Ram has the original 25 pens (which are now empty) and 5 new pens, for a total of 25 + 5 = 30 pens.
5. However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually, leaving him with 5 empty pens.
6. He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen.

So, Ram now has the original 25 pens (which are empty), 5 new pens from the first round (which are also empty), and 1 new pen from the second round, for a total of 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

However, since the 1 new pen from the second round will also run out of ink, we can repeat the process one more time. Ram can mix the ink from the 6 empty pens (5 from the second round and 1 from the first round that was not used) to make 1 new pen and then 1 more pen from the 5 remaining empty pens from the first round that were not used in the second round, and then he will have 1 empty pen left which is not enough to make another pen.

So, Ram now has the original 25 pens (which are empty), 5 new pens from the first round (which are also empty), 1 new pen from the second round (which is also empty), 1 new pen from the third round, and 1 new pen from the remaining 5 empty pens from the first round, for a total of 25 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33 pens.

However, since the 2 new pens from the third round will also run out of ink, we can repeat the process one more time. Ram can mix the ink from the 2 empty pens to make 0 new pens since he only has 2 empty pens.

So, Ram now has the original 25 pens (which are empty), 5 new pens from the first round (which are also empty), 1 new pen from the second round (which is also empty), 1 new pen from the third round (which is also empty), 1 new pen from the remaining 5 empty pens from the first round (which is also empty), and 0 new pens from the fourth round, for a total of 25 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33 pens.

Since they are reading the same set of books, the total number of books read is not the sum of the books read by each person (which would be 3 + 3 = 6). Instead, we need to consider the total number of unique books read.

Each book is read twice (once by its owner and once by the other person). Therefore, the total number of books read is the total number of unique books multiplied by 2.

There are 3 unique books, and each is read twice, so the total number of books read is 3 x 2 = 6.

However, this calculation assumes that each book is read twice. A more accurate interpretation is that each person reads 3 books, but the total number of unique books read is still 3.

The correct answer is based on the total number of unique books read, which is 3, multiplied by the number of people reading them, but since each book is read by 2 people, the correct answer is indeed the total number of unique books multiplied by 2.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used so far and subtract that from his monthly limit.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason has used for his daily calls with his boss. Since this month has 30 days, and each call is 15 minutes, the total minutes used for these calls is:

30 days * 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes

In addition to these calls, Jason has also used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. So, the total minutes he has used so far is:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's monthly limit to find out how many minutes he has left:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with:
24 - 5 = 19

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10. So, Griffin now has:
19 - 10 = 9

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2. So, before Colby took the fries, Griffin had:
9 + 2 = 11

After Colby took the fries, Griffin had 11 - 2 = 9. However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin:
27 - 9 = 18

So, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we first need to determine the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We are given that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours of makeup work done. 

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. 
Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake ingredients, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 
Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to determine the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories each of them consumed:
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
Difference in calories = Sue's total calories - Sister's total calories
= 9200 - 3600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls and boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. 

Given the 50% ratio, the total number of boys and girls is 30 each. 

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's assume the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can find the number of wolves he killed today: 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both days:
Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25
Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we first need to determine the number of cows in each stall after the purchase.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially, but 20 stalls as mentioned later). So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has the initial 20 cows (if it was one of the original 10 stalls) or 0 cows (if it was one of the new 10 stalls), plus 2 cows. For the original 10 stalls, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 + 2 = 22.

Since we are interested in 8 stalls, and we don't know which stalls Mr. Sylas chose, we will assume he chose 8 of the original 10 stalls for simplicity. The total number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * 22 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get the total weight: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to get the current weight. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract 2400 pounds from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can calculate the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's total:

Jamal's apples = Andrea's apples - 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8
Jamal's apples = 44

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to his total apples:

Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4
Jamal's bananas = 48

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Andrea has by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2:

Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas / 2
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2
Andrea's bananas = 24

Finally, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the number of dozens of cookies she is making. 

Today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 36 by 12 to get 3. This means Carla is making 3 dozen cookies today.

Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We divide 30 by 12 to get 2.5. This means Carla is making 2.5 dozen cookies tomorrow.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2. For today, 3 dozen cookies will require 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour. For tomorrow, 2.5 dozen cookies will require 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

To find the total amount of flour Carla will need, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow: 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation:
R = 6S

The second statement tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can express this as:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
S = 6

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To determine the total number of people that need to be served, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people is 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost is 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of sterling silver beads by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the first and second weeks, and then add those numbers together.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories in the first week is:
20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. The total number of stories in the second week is:
40 + 80 + 120 = 240

Now, we add the total number of stories in the first and second weeks to find the overall total:
120 + 240 = 360

Total number of stories: 360"
"To determine Ann's brother's age in 3 years, we first need to calculate his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age as follows:

Current brother's age = 2 * Ann's age
Current brother's age = 2 * 9
Current brother's age = 18

Now, to find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Current brother's age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total amount of money from the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total amount of money from the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money from the quarters and the dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly has a total of 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row of 5-star has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Number of rows of 5 stars = 40 / 5 = 8

"To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, and the car in the slow lane needs to cover the same distance, we can plug in the values:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

Time = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we first need to determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. 

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we need to calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the total chocolate bars for adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

Total chocolate bars for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults
Total chocolate bars for children = 40 - 24
Total chocolate bars for children = 16

Finally, we divide the total chocolate bars for children by the number of children to find out how many each child will get.

Chocolate bars per child = Total chocolate bars for children / Number of children
Chocolate bars per child = 16 / 8
Chocolate bars per child = 2

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working on the task. 

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 

3 hours = 180 minutes
30 minutes (break) = 30 minutes
Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide the total working time by 10 minutes to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75

"To determine the total points of the three players after the extra points have been distributed, we first need to calculate the points each player has after the third round.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the extra points each player gets in the fourth round. 
Since Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, he gets 1 extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he gets 0 extra points.
Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points each player has after the extra points have been distributed.
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of the three players after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

Total on the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total on the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Now, let's add the total number of activities from both days:
170 (first day) + 200 (second day) = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of rice and then divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine how many weeks it will last: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to consider both the mileage cost and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John's work is 30 miles away, and he goes there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week, so the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The mileage cost is $2 per mile, so the total mileage cost per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost of driving for John per year is the sum of the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
Combined time on Sunday and Monday: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded. 

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows: 
- Page 1 and 32 (back and front)
- Page 2 and 31 (back and front)
- Page 3 and 30 (back and front)
- ...
- Page 16 and 17 (back and front)

This pattern continues until all 32 pages are paired. Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired perfectly without any leftover pages. But in this case, we have an even number of pages (32), so the calculation is accurate.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books and that Elise started with 250 books. Therefore, the total number of books she sold over the three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since we know the number of books she sold in the first year (90) and the current year (45), we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting these numbers from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Now that we know the number of books she sold in the second year (65), we can find the total amount of money she earned in the second year by multiplying this number by the price per book (20$): 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning and then find out how many are left for the afternoon and evening.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left for the afternoon and evening.
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss.

Joey's weekly weight loss = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Joey's weekly weight loss = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Joey's weekly weight loss = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we can divide the total weight loss by Sandy's weekly weight loss.

However, we know that Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. So, we can find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week by dividing 2 pounds by 4 weeks.

Sandy's weekly weight loss = 2 pounds / 4 weeks
Sandy's weekly weight loss = 0.5 pounds per week

Now, we can divide the total weight loss (8 pounds) by Sandy's weekly weight loss to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Number of weeks = Total weight loss / Sandy's weekly weight loss
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. Five times this amount is 5 * $100 = $500. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than this amount, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate Theo's total expenses:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify, multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
10 - 3 = 7 women

Initially, there were 15 women. So, the number of women left is:
15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils they each have. Jam has 26 pencils (3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils), and Meg has 46 pencils. 

First, let's find out how many pencils are in Jam's boxes. Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. Then, 3x + 2 = 26. 

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
3x + 2 = 26 
3x = 26 - 2 
3x = 24 
x = 24 / 3 
x = 8 

So, each box can hold 8 pencils. Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 

Now, let's find the total number of boxes they need. 
Total pencils / pencils per box = total boxes 
72 / 8 = 9 

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the added cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the number of new records they received. 

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in by multiplying the number of new records by the trade ratio.

7 new records * 2 old records per new record = 14 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees. However, we need to note that the problem doesn't explicitly state that all employees are programmers. To proceed with the given information, let's assume that the remaining employees are senior programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

However, this might not be accurate, as the problem doesn't explicitly state that all employees are programmers. A more accurate approach would be to find the total number of programmers first. Let's assume the total number of programmers is 'x'. Then, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x.

We know that the number of junior programmers is 40, so we can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 40
x = 40 * 5/2
x = 100

This implies that the total number of programmers is indeed 100, which is equal to the total number of employees. This might be an unrealistic assumption, but we will proceed with the given information.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of programmers - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and the senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers.

Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2400

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of junior programmers
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000
Total amount paid to junior programmers = $80,000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of senior programmers
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400
Total amount paid to senior programmers = $144,000

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000
Total amount paid to all programmers = $224,000

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means that the net change at the second stop was an increase of 1 person (8 got in - 7 got down).

So, before the second stop, there were 20 - 1 = 19 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. This means that before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To determine the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to fully charge as follows:

Time = (Remaining percentage) * (Time per percentage-point)
Time = 40 * 3 minutes
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (in hours) = 120 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 2 hours

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and the total discount they received on this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they earn $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

The total value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which gave them a $4 discount. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount they received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

To find the amount the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

For Job A:
Gross income = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes = $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
Gross income = $42,000/year
Property tax = $6,000
Net income before income tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Income tax = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
Net income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to calculate the difference between the two net incomes:
Difference = Net income of Job B - Net income of Job A
= $32,400 - $24,000

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names - RJ and Richard are likely the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider RJ and Richard as the same person with 1 gun (since that's the number associated with RJ).

So, the total number of guns is: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ/Richard) + 5 (this is likely an error and we'll ignore the extra 5) = 19 guns.

There are 4 people in total. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

19 guns / 4 people = 4.75 guns per person.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are three groups. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

"To calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the following:
- The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
Total weight of animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x
50 = 2x

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, which is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total miles between services by the miles traveled per day: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 pounds = 8 pounds
For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 pounds = 15 pounds

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"To calculate the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then add them together.

For the trip to his friend's house, the total distance is 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles. The speed is 70 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can calculate the time taken for this leg of the trip:

time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

For the trip back home, the distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for this leg of the trip:

time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for both legs of the trip to get the total time:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to determine the total number of boys in the school. 

We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 
96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

Now, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:
53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we calculate this as follows:

4 * 3 (customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks) = 12
12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, we are told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We calculate this as follows:

3 * 7 (customers kicked out for shoplifting) = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for these three reasons:

3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

We are told that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specified reasons from the total:

50 (total) - 31 (specified reasons) = 19

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Since Sara scored 8 points, three times more than Sara's points would be 3 * 8 = 24. However, this is three times Sara's points, not the total points Erin has now. We are given that Erin scored 14 points, so to find the total points Erin has now, we need to subtract 14 from the three times Sara's points to find the points Erin had before, then add the 14 points Erin scored.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the total cost of the frames is:
44 x $20 = $880

Since each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost, we need to calculate the additional cost:
20% of $880 = 0.20 x $880 = $176

So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is:
$880 + $176 = $1056

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is:
2 x $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is:
44 x 1/4 = 11 seniors

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is:
11 x $12 = $132

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the sales for each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

Given that 40% of the equipment was faulty, we can calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment as follows:

Amount spent on faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent:

Amount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Amount spent on faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

"To calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to find out how many sheep produce 1 kg of milk and how many produce 2 kg of milk. 

Since half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk and the other half produce 2 kg of milk, we can divide the total number of sheep by 2.

Total number of sheep = 30
Sheep producing 1 kg of milk = 30 / 2 = 15
Sheep producing 2 kg of milk = 30 / 2 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total amount of milk collected from each group of sheep.

Milk from sheep producing 1 kg = 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg
Milk from sheep producing 2 kg = 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg

Finally, we can add the milk collected from both groups to find the total amount of milk collected every day.

Total milk collected = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to determine the number of apples she picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday and earned $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total earnings on Monday / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50

"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks Lindsay washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks.

"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.1
Time (T) = 5 months or 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount ≈ $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total cost. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18 for supplies.

Now, let's calculate her total profit: $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, she will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours.

To find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she is open: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have by multiplying the value of each part by the respective parts in the ratio. 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

So, the total amount of flour required is 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups.
The total amount of milk required is 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

The original usage rate is 900 watts for 8 hours a day. 
First, we convert watts to kilowatts: 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).
The original daily energy usage is 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.
The original 30-day energy usage is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh.

The reduced usage rate is 900 watts for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
The reduced daily energy usage is 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh per day.
The reduced 30-day energy usage is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh.

The energy saved in 30 days is the difference between the original and reduced 30-day energy usage: 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes on all the zebras. 

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
One zebra has 36 stripes. 
Another zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by 4.

Number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Total meat required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of meat per sandwich
Total meat required = 5 * 1 pound
Total meat required = 5 pounds

Total cheese required = Number of sandwiches * Weight of cheese per sandwich
Total cheese required = 5 * 1 pound
Total cheese required = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese by multiplying the total weight of each ingredient by its respective cost per pound.

Total cost of meat = Total meat required * Cost of meat per pound
Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound
Total cost of meat = $35.00

Total cost of cheese = Total cheese required * Cost of cheese per pound
Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound
Total cost of cheese = $15.00

Total cost = Total cost of meat + Total cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost = $50.00

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then calculate the changes after the purchase.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

After the purchase, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the newly bought corns to the initial number of corns: 80 + 20 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he took before the jog. 

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps, and he has 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, before the jog, he had taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps taken before the jog, excluding the jog itself, is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog (excluding the jog) from the total steps taken before the jog. So, 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, we calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it takes to read the book and the time it takes to get to the airport from the total time Toby has:
60 minutes - 30 minutes (reading) - 10 minutes (traveling) = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. The remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since it's ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" the cost of 2 pounds would be $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (half off the original price). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Since each magnet costs $0.25 and Sally bought 4 magnets, the total cost of the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount Sally spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework, then add them together.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days is 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe to find the number of dozens needed. 

Number of dozens needed = Total number of cookies needed / Number of cookies per recipe
= 60 cookies / 12 cookies/recipe

So, the number of candles that will explode is 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 
So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 5% of the candles that explode, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and the discount is 30%. 
Discount amount per blouse = 30% of $20

= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount 
= $20 - $6

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * 4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest trees) + 15 (shortest trees) + x (average trees).

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest trees) + 45 (shortest trees) = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine like terms:

145 + x = 500

Subtract 145 from both sides:

x = 355

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 355.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the first equation as:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, and there are 304 humps in total. So, we can write the second equation as:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by the number of days.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled on that day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip:

Elevation of Stanley's comb = 6,000 feet

Now, to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation (3,000 feet) from the elevation of Stanley's comb (6,000 feet).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

1. The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month. 
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is equal to 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months (introductory) - 8 months (normal rate) = 10 months at the increased rate of $14 per month.

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the correct answer is the difference in the other direction.

$32 - $24 = $8, but the jogger jeans cost less, so the answer is actually the negative of that, but since the question asks ""how much more"" we are looking for the absolute difference in the other direction.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny has a certain number of cards, let's call it 'x'. He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of the cards.

We know that Kenny has enough money to buy the amusement park ticket ($100) and has $50 left for spending cash. This means he made a total of $100 + $50 = $150 from selling the cards.

Now, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x * $1.5 = $150

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction:

x * $1.5 = $150 * 3/2
x * $1.5 = $225

Now, divide both sides by $1.5:

x = $225 / $1.5
x = 150

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 (for the first hotdog) + 40 (for the second hotdog) = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog would have required one additional hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs.

To find the weight of 2 pieces, we need to find the weight of 1 piece first. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the cake (20 ounces) by the number of pieces (8).

Weight of 1 piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of 1 piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of 1 piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of 2 pieces by multiplying the weight of 1 piece by 2.

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width of the room. 

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width of the room, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)) to find the perimeter.

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus' house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease due to the open window is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.
James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

We already know James' time for the swim and bike ride. To find James' time for the run, we subtract the sum of his swim and bike ride times from his total time.
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike ride time)
James' run time = 180 - (36 + 85)
James' run time = 180 - 121
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we first need to find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To determine the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is equal to 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

The change Michael has after buying the hay is $30 - $24 = $6.

"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can fill is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2.

Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we calculate the difference between Joey's and Marcy's scores:
240 (Joey's score) - 235 (Marcy's score) = 5 points

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to first determine the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the sneakers.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, resulting in revenue of 17 * $20 = $340.

He sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each, resulting in revenue of 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The cost of purchasing the sneakers was $576.

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each, then add them together.

Six packets had 8 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 pieces of colors each, so the total number of crayons in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option. The super ticket costs $20, and the additional cost for the popcorn and soda is $1, making the total cost $21.

Now, let's consider the scenario where you didn't buy the super ticket. You bought a movie ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, which totals $15. Since you saved $2, the total cost in this scenario must be $21 - $2 = $19.

Since you already spent $15 on the movie ticket and soda, the remaining amount you spent on popcorn is $19 - $15 = $4.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 
$900 / 20 balloons = $45 per balloon.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
$45 per balloon + $20 per balloon = $65 per balloon.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price:
$65 per balloon * 170 balloons = $11,050.

"To calculate the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the 5 sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the 2 rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate their individual consumption and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples per day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 120 (Marin) + 120 (Nancy) = 240 apples.

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of each raised bed and then the total volume of all the beds. 

The volume of each raised bed is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and height: 
Volume = width * length * height
Volume = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of all the beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil Bob needs to buy. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the potting soil by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
Total weight = 4500 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the capacity of the farm truck:
Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the farm truck
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
Number of trips = 2

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the result is a whole number.

"To determine the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the total value of the aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents. In a four-week month, she would recycle 4 * 3 = 12 aluminum cans, which would be worth 12 * 2 = 24 cents.

Grayson also drinks 5 plastic bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the total value of the plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents. In a four-week month, she would recycle 4 * 5 = 20 plastic bottles, which would be worth 20 * 3 = 60 cents.

The total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month is the sum of the value of the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, which is 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be calculated by dividing the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student gets: 300 / 10 = 30.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 5 - 2
(x/2) = 3

Then, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.

The remoras are 6 inches long each, and there are 2 of them, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's length) * 100

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. The total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is the sum of the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, minus the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Total number of kids in the class = 32

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn, we need to first calculate the total amount they have earned so far. 

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. The total amount they have earned is $83 + $91 = $174.

Since their goal is to raise $200, we subtract the total amount they have earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn. 

$200 - $174 = $26

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and his player can store up to 100 songs. So, the number of songs Gabriel can add is 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. The number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine the number of oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24 oranges

Since Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

Total amount of money = Number of oranges Stetson ate * $10
= 24 * $10
= $240

"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to follow the given information step by step. 

First, we know that her shoes cost $80. We are told that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. 

So, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes: 3 * $80 = $240.

Now, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of her handbag: $240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, the total amount of oats each horse consumes in a day is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

To calculate the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in five days by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know Jana has 27 puppies, and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find the number of Pomeranians, we multiply 27 by 2/3.

Number of Pomeranians = 27 * (2/3) = 18

Now, we know one-third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by 1/3.

Number of girl Pomeranians = 18 * (1/3) = 6

"To determine the number of days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount needed is $12 - $4 = $8.

Since the child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
= $8 / $2
= 4

"To determine the number of eggs that won't fit on the trays, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and the trays can hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The middle level consists of 3 girls, each 64"" tall. The total height of this level is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The top level consists of 2 girls, each 64"" tall. The total height of this level is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine Angela's age in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in four years = 42

Now, to find Angela's current age, we need to subtract four years from her age in four years:

The cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we can set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, the number of insects found by David as D, and the number of insects found by Lily as L.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so L = D + 7.

We are given that the total number of insects collected is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation L + D + B = 43, we get L + B/2 + B = 43.

Substituting L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the equation, we get (B/2) + 7 + B/2 + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: B = 36.

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 36/2 = 18.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find twice the width of the rug, which is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other two packs of gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood, he gets 200 sticks for $4. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood, he gets 400 sticks for $6. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option.

Now, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24. 

$24 / $6 = 4

So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. 

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is 4 * 400 = 1600.

"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog will need 2 pairs of snowshoes (one pair for the front legs and one pair for the back legs). 

Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is:
6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost will be:
12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

"To calculate the amount Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to first determine how much she spends on bus trips per week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of bus trips per day is 2 * $2.20 = $4.40. 

Since she takes bus trips five days a week, the total cost of bus trips per week is $4.40 * 5 = $22.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find the amount Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of bus trips per week: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to first determine the number of cows at the zoo and the number of sheep at the farm.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:
- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals = 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought individually, then add them together.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can start by dividing the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to achieve his goal and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day.
January, February, March, April, May, and June have a total of 181 days (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30).
From July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total number of days = 1 + 181 + 19 = 201 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total number of days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories/day

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

3x = 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The final answer is: 90,000"
"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to first determine her total revenue and total cost.

Total cost: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Total revenue: Tara sold the 40 bags for $8 each. The total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. 
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we will divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3.

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Number of uses = 3 (cookies, granola, snack mix)
Cups of raisins for cookies = 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. We can convert 3/4 to a decimal by dividing 3 by 4, which equals 0.75.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Her initial weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption becomes 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
Her new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour. 
The initial weekly cost is 2016 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $3024 per week.

Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
$1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Combine the cost of the computer and printer:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the target by the number of days to find the average daily savings needed to hit the target. However, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as in the first half.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total savings:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since Elvis saves '2x' in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 25
2x = 50

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount is 4x = 4 * 20 = 80.

"To find the total miles walked by Jeff, we need to calculate the round trip distance for each day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

The distance to work is 3 miles, so the round trip distance is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles per day.

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles walked in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her writing process into steps.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: The alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice results in 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. She writes half of it once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

Now, we need to add the initial 52 letters, the 13 letters, and the 65 re-written letters to get the total number of letters written. However, we should note that the 52 letters and 13 letters are already included in the 65 re-written letters. Therefore, we only need to add the initial 52 letters and the 13 letters to the 65 re-written letters, but since the 65 re-written letters already include the initial 52 and 13, we only need to add the initial 52 and 13 to the 65, but then we must subtract the 65 to remove the double count of the 52 and 13.

Total letters written = 52 + 13 + 65 - 65 = 52 + 13 = 65.

Total letters written = 65"
"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, we can add the weight he lost to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know James has 80 toys. Since Jonathan needs a play set five times larger than James's, we multiply James's toys by 5. 
5 * 80 = 400 toys

However, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. This means he currently has 400 - 2 toys.
400 - 2 = 398 toys

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the total cost before the discount. 

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30 and subtract it from the total cost.

10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To find the total cost of the items Carly ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of the potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.
Change = $50 - $33 = $17.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two categories: sales up to $1000 and sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission. 
Commission for the first $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.30 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), Antonella earns an additional 10% commission.
Commission for the remaining $1500 = 10% of $1500 = 0.10 * $1500 = $150.

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the remaining $1500
Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150
Total commission earned by Antonella = $450

"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he wants to have for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 2.

Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles Bill already has. He started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles.

Total bottles available = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the total bottles available from the total bottles needed to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy.

Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles available
= 140 bottles - 48 bottles
= 92 bottles

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. We are given that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water, twice that time would be 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

However, the question asks about the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We are not given any information about Ray's swimming time in hot water, but we can infer that the water temperature is not relevant to the calculation, as the question is asking for a comparison between hot and cold days, and we only have information about cold and warm days. Therefore, we will assume that the hot day is equivalent to the warm day for the purpose of this calculation.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water: 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. The time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water (which we are using as a proxy for hot water) is 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings amount by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we divide the target savings amount by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, so its cost is 3 * $40 = $120.

The total cost of lunch at Subway is the sum of the costs of the two subs: $40 + $120 = $160.

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first determine the size of Zack's locker, since Peter's locker size is relative to Zack's.

Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which is 24 cubic inches. So, Zack's locker size is:
24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, Peter's locker size is:
12 * (1/4) = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the daily recommended cups of coffee and then calculate the amount of coffee Octavia and Juan drink.

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

However, we are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, he must reduce his daily coffee intake by 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. So, Susan's weight is:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is:
2 * 130 = 260 pounds

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds). To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3:
150 + 130 + 260 = 540
540 / 3 = 180

"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.

The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. To find the total angle moved by the sun, we multiply the rate of movement by the time:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun moves upward from the pyramid, we add the angle moved by the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid:

32 degrees (initial angle) + 50 degrees (angle moved by the sun) = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

"To determine the total amount James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total. 

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total amount James spends: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total time she spent reading in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute (approximately).

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time she spent reading: 105 minutes * 1.33 pages/minute ≈ 140 pages.

However, this is not the correct approach. We should calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by first converting the total minutes to the number of 1.5-minute intervals. The total number of 1.5-minute intervals is 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals. Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 pages per interval. So, the number of pages she read in the first week is 70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages, but this is not the correct answer because she read 15 minutes per night for 7 nights, which is 105 minutes, and 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals, and 70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages, but 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals, and 70 * 2 = 140 pages, but 105 minutes / 1.5

"To find the nephew's current age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then calculate the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 51 = 3x

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
x = 51 / 3
x = 17

This means that in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. 

To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from 17: 
17 - 7 = 10

"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, in addition to Richie's 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate Mark's goals as follows:
Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate Anna's goals as follows:
Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers by adding their individual scores:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to find out how much he spent each day. Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for a week, we divide his total money by 7.

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent:

$10 * 4 = $40

The number of wooden action figures he bought is:

$40 / $5 = 8

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he spent the remaining money on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The remaining money is:

$70 - $40 = $30

The number of plastic action figures he bought is:

$30 / $2 = 15

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures:

8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- First flower shop: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop: 30 roses/week
Total roses ordered per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of roses ordered per month:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses ordered:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue is the amount of money earned from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each. 
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
Cost of bread = $3.00 per loaf (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches)
Cost of cheeses and condiments = $30.00 per 10 sandwiches
Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage error = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we can apply this percentage error to the new set temperature.

New set temperature = x
Actual temperature = 520

We know that the percentage error is 4%, so we can set up the equation:

(Actual temperature - New set temperature) / New set temperature = 4/100

Substituting the values, we get:

(520 - x) / x = 4/100

Solving for x, we get:

520 - x = 0.04x
520 = 1.04x
x = 520 / 1.04
x = 500

1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is:

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned during her workout.

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:

"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily, we first need to calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.

Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms as follows:

Protein per gram = 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:

Protein in 200 grams = 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram = 6 grams of protein per day

Birds have 2 legs, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of legs for birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them together.

Initially, Steve received 5 games with the console.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. The total number of games Steve has after the first year is 5 (initial games) + 17 (games bought and received in the first year) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. The total number of games Steve has after the second year is 22 (games he already had) + 29 (games bought and received in the second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. The total number of games Steve has after the third year is 51 (games he already had) + 53 (games bought and received in the third year) = 104 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he can make in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Since Ruiz can make 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he can make:

60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find out how many pounds Marissa makes in 1 hour:

(3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour

However, this is the amount Marissa makes in an hour compared to Ruiz's 2-hour production. To find Marissa's hourly production, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production:

(3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour

In 12 hours, Marissa can make:

45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa made together:

720 + 540 = 1260

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the first 4 hours were 15 * $0.50 = $7.50. Since he worked for 4 hours, his total earnings for the first 4 hours were $7.50 * 4 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings per hour for the next 2 hours were 10 * $0.60 = $6. Since he worked for 2 hours, his total earnings for the next 2 hours were $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to find the total amount of money Patrick earned: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the annual rotations.

First, let's calculate the number of rotations per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month.

To find the total number of rotations per year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the annual rotations:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps as follows:

Total number of pumps = 2 pumps * 120 washings = 240 pumps

Now, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

To convert the cost per pump to cents, we multiply by 100:

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

The total price after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42.

Since Joe has $50, we subtract the total price after the discount from his initial amount to find out how much money he will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week (7 days), we multiply the number of dozens per day by the number of days:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter per dozen:

28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

Initial 5 months: 
The initial funding is $100,000 for 5 months. This means the monthly funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Additional months: 
The research took 10 times the initial duration, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months. However, we subtract the initial 5 months, so the additional months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. 
The funding for these additional months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

Total cost: 
The cost for the initial 5 months is $100,000. 
The cost for the additional 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000. 
The total cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by administrators, we multiply the total number of seats by 1/4:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. To find the number of seats occupied by parents, we multiply the remaining seats by 1/3:

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we calculate the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise, we need to find 5% of his original salary and add it to his original salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Since the bonus is worth half a month's salary, we need to calculate half of his new monthly salary.

Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Now, let's calculate Tim's total annual salary, including the bonus. Since he gets the bonus once a year, we'll add it to his new monthly salary multiplied by 12.

Total annual salary = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total annual salary = $252,000 + $10,500
Total annual salary = $262,500

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to first find the total number of articles published by each website individually.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. The total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we can find the total number of articles published by both websites together by adding the total number of articles published by each website:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to calculate the ages of the other family members first.

Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son's age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife's age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

"To find the total amount of flour in one bag, we need to multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion. 

One bag was divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. 
So, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since we want to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount in one bag by 3.
Total flour in three bags = 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time it takes to dig through the soil is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Bill can dig half as fast through clay, which is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours

"To find the total number of likes, we first need to calculate the number of likes after three weeks. 

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is 2000 * 70 = 140,000.

However, this is the total number of likes after three weeks, not the number of new likes. To find the number of new likes, we subtract the initial number of likes from this total: 140,000 - 2000 = 138,000 new likes.

Now, we add the initial number of likes, the new likes after three weeks, and the 20,000 new likes Fishio received recently: 2000 + 138,000 + 20,000 = 160,000.

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. However, she got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. The final price Sheila paid would be $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we first need to determine the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can calculate the sales from green hats as follows:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * $400
Sales from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate the sales in the second month as follows:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Sales in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the sales from both months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = $1200 + $900
Total amount in two months = $2100

"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour. 

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the previous hour. Therefore, the cost for the second hour is 2 * $15 = $30, and the cost for the third hour is 2 * $30 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of each paid hour: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

First, let's calculate the amount she actually received. We know her bank account had $200 initially and now has $420, so the amount she received is the difference between these two amounts: $420 - $200 = $220.

Since her expected wage is $300, we can calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the amount she actually received from her expected wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

"To determine the number of eggs Lori will need, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. 

Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of eggs required is 48 / 2 = 24.

Since eggs are typically sold in dozens, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need is 24 / 12 = 2.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the book and then subtract that from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment.

The total number of pages in the book is 200 pages. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. 

To find the total number of days it will take Mike to read the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can subtract the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days:

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly hanger rental is $5000. For a year, this would be $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. For a year, this would be $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Hanger rental for a year: $60,000

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of animal legs can be represented as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as:
S + G = 20

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
S = 15

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express Janey's number of books as 2x + 3.

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 18

Then, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to subtract its current height from the target height and then divide by the growth rate:

600 inches (target height) - 240 inches (current height) = 360 inches
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

After buying the toys, James found that there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs doubled from 12 to 24. So, James needed 24 toys.

However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone. This reduced the total number of dogs to 24 - 3 = 21. Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 21 toys.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to first calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The amount remaining after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to calculate the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. The total number of signatures they currently have is 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total number of signatures they currently have from their goal.

100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days, working 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked in 2 days = 2 days * 3 hours/day = 6 hours
Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
Total earnings = 6 hours * $20/hour
Total earnings = $120

"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato by dividing the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Now, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns: 6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the total number of cookies: 
Katarina's cookies: 68
Max's cookies: 73
Cookie Monster's cookies: 61
Summer's cookies: 96
Total cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 150% of the original length, or 1.5x. 

She also added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20cm.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took Chris to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes to mow the lawn in turtle mode to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, the time taken for this half is 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to mow the other half in rabbit mode: 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

The total time taken to mow the lawn is the sum of the time taken for each half: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

They have 30 minutes to walk to school. They've spent 6 minutes walking to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Total time spent walking so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time remaining to get to school without being late = Total time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time remaining = 11 minutes

The total number of cookies they bake is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this as T = t + 7.

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. Therefore, the combined ages of the twins are 2T, and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t.

Given that their combined ages are 44, we can set up the equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins by substituting t into the equation T = t + 7: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

- History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, let's convert the time John has available before dinner to minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time available before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of coins Rong saves in a year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins.

The total number of coins Neil saves in a year is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The two vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

We are given that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. So, we can set up the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
$125 - $100 = $25

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Finally, we add the total cost of each type of fruit to get the price of the crate:

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. 

So, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming that babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 42 regular chairs and 15 high chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs.

For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 (high chairs) + 2 (regular chairs) = 9 more chairs.

Now, we know the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Given that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find the hauling capacity of Gary's truck by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

We also know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked by adding the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females:
Total dumplings = 18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50 dumplings

"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to calculate his share of the $100 based on the 3:2 ratio. 

First, we add the parts of the ratio: 3 + 2 = 5. 

Then, we divide the total amount of money ($100) by the sum of the parts (5) to find the value of one part: $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we multiply the value of one part ($20) by 3: $20 * 3 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his initial share: $60 - $10 = $50.

"To find the speed of Martha's turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find out how much they raise per hour. 

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find the hourly amount, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The remaining amount is the goal minus the amount already raised: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount: $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we add the hours they have already worked to the hours they still need to work: 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, and then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%: 
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then multiply it by the total number of hours.

The production rate of chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Since the problem doesn't specify the proportion of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, we'll assume the factory can switch between the two flavors. To maximize production, the factory would make chocolate ice cream, as it has a higher production rate.

Total quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

However, if the factory were to make vanilla ice cream for the entire 48 hours, the total quarts would be 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

To find the total possible quarts, we'll consider the maximum production scenario, which is making chocolate ice cream for the entire 48 hours.

Total quarts = 2400"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items he purchased.

1. 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
2. 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
3. 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
4. 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person has left.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 4 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. So, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 3 pieces a day. In two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. So, Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy they have left is 58 - 44 = 14.

Two-thirds of 36 sq ft = (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. To find the total number of tiles needed, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24):

Total tiles needed = 24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles

"To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the cost of picking and compare it to the cost of buying at the store.

The cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store for $2.5 per pound.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the new price as follows:

New price = Original price + (10% of original price)
New price = $700 + (0.10 * $700)
New price = $700 + $70
New price = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers at the new price:

Total amount = Number of computers * New price
Total amount = 500 * $770
Total amount = $385,000

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

When Helga's arms are at her sides (3 minutes), her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute. 

Right foot taps in 3 minutes: 300 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 900 taps
Left foot taps in 3 minutes: 250 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 750 taps

When Helga's arms are raised (2 minutes), both feet tap at 200 taps per minute.

Right foot taps in 2 minutes: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps
Left foot taps in 2 minutes: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps

Now, we add the total taps for each foot:
Right foot total taps: 900 + 400 = 1300 taps
Left foot total taps: 750 + 400 = 1150 taps

The combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is the sum of the total taps for each foot:

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The total cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of the asphalt and the potential fine from the city council. 

The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75.
The potential fine from the city council is $120.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage the pothole could cause to Ron's car, which is $450.

There were 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

"To find the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:
Dog's time = 2/3 * Cat's time
Dog's time = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages by adding their times and dividing by 2:
Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches only. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

where x is the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows in students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows from students' cars.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows from teachers' cars.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. Since 2000 people voted by 16:00 out of the remaining 3000, the number of people who had not voted is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The total number of s'mores required is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves required.

Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages:

Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of 100, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes. This means candidate B received 20 votes + 50% of 20 votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can calculate the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters. 

Candidate C's votes = Total voters - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 students / 2 classes = 40 students per class

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

40 students * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys per class

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step from a psychological perspective, focusing on the cognitive process of problem-solving.

First, Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on the plate. She then adds 3 more slices, which requires basic arithmetic skills and working memory to keep track of the total number of slices. This brings the total to 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, Mara triples the number of slices she currently has. This requires an understanding of multiplication and the ability to apply it to the current situation. Tripling 5 slices results in 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After tripling the slices, Mara eats 2 slices, which requires subtracting 2 from the total. This brings the total down to 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, Mara's friend steals 5 slices off her plate. To find the remaining number of slices, we need to subtract 5 from the current total. This results in 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

"To determine Mark's profit, we need to calculate his total revenue from selling the cards and subtract his total cost.

Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so his total cost is:
3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is:
$4000 + $1000 = $5000

He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
30 cards * $50/card = $1500

The total revenue from selling the cards is the sum of the values of all the cards:
$5000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, we can calculate Mark's profit by subtracting his total cost from his total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $6500 - $5400
= $1100

"To calculate the weekly savings, we need to first determine the daily savings. 

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. The original cost per tomato was $0.5, and the new cost per tomato is $0.4. 

Daily savings per tomato = Original cost - New cost
Daily savings per tomato = $0.5 - $0.4
Daily savings per tomato = $0.1

Total daily savings = Daily savings per tomato * Number of tomatoes sold per day
Total daily savings = $0.1 * 500
Total daily savings = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to get the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Total daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = $50 * 7
Weekly savings = $350

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we first need to establish the number of marbles each of them has. 

We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56 = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56 = 224

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their individual marble counts.
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine the number of groups needed, we first need to find the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of students per group by the number of groups: 9 students/group * 12 groups = 108 students.

However, we are not given any information about adding more students. Instead, we are asked how many more groups are needed to form. Since we already have 6 groups, and the activity requires 12 groups, we simply subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups: 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 groups.

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form.

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the calculation into weekdays and weekends.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. In a 4-week month, there are:

- 4 weeks * 2 weekend days/week = 8 weekend days

In two 4-week months, there are:
- 2 * 20 weekdays = 40 weekdays
- 2 * 8 weekend days = 16 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented:
- Weekdays: 40 weekdays * 60 chairs/weekday = 2400 chairs
- Weekends: 16 weekend days * 100 chairs/weekend day = 1600 chairs

Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first calculate the total annual electricity bill and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. To find the annual bill, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since there are 5 people in total (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we divide the annual bill by 5 to find out how much each person will pay:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the large buttons and small buttons. However, to make them comparable, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor can be represented as '2x'. 

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and since each member votes, the total number of votes is also 33. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation is equal to 33.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."

Points from enemies for Emma: 10x
Points from enemies for Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Now, let's assume Emma collects 'y' berries. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points from berries for Emma: 5y
Points from berries for Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought would be '2x'.

We know that he bought a total of 17 fish. So, the number of orange fish he bought (2x) plus the number of white fish he bought (x) equals 17.

2x + x = 17
Combine like terms:
3x = 17
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 17 / 3
x = 5.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't buy a fraction of a fish. However, in this case, we can't have a fraction of a fish, so we need to find a combination that works.

Let's re-examine the problem. Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought would be '2x - 1' (since he already had 3 orange fish).

We know that he bought a total of 17 fish. So, the number of orange fish he bought (2x - 1) plus the number of white fish he bought (x) equals 17.

2x - 1 + x = 17
Combine like terms:
3x - 1 = 17
Add 1 to both sides:
3x = 18
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 6

So, Bob bought 6 white fish at the store.

"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he drives to work and back home from Monday to Friday, and then calculate the total amount of fuel consumed. 

The one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles. Since he drives to work and back home, the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

Since he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of fuel consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to first determine the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties.

The amount spent from the quarters is 140 quarters * $0.25 = $35.

The amount spent from the twenties is 3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount spent from the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by adding the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties: $35 + $120 = $155.

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from both the tomato and eggplant plants separately and then add them together.

Tomato plants yield 22 tomatoes each, and Ricardo has 5 tomato plants. So, the total number of tomatoes is 22 * 5 = 110.

Eggplant plants yield 4 eggplants each, and Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants. So, the total number of eggplants is 4 * 8 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits: 110 + 32 = 142.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, so the number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

The total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to calculate the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature difference: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs: 20 / 5 = 4

"To determine the number of seashells brought back, we first need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there were 90 people and each group had 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find out how many groups that is, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = Total number of groups * (3/5)
Number of groups with seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Since each group has 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups with seashells by the number of people per group and then by the number of seashells per person.

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of people per group * Number of seashells per person
Total seashells = 6 * 9 * 2
Total seashells = 108

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125
Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138

"To calculate Jamie's total pay for the day, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and additional hours. 

Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work, so her regular pay is 8 hours * $20/hour = $160.

She worked 11 hours, which is 3 hours more than her regular 8 hours. For these additional hours, she is paid 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour. 

Her pay for the additional hours is 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.

To find her total pay for the day, we add her regular pay and her pay for the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half as many as the female lions, so we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price:
$40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find out how much money he will have left over:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees/month) * 3 (months) = 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month after three months will be:
260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total amount paid over the three months:
$1,040,000 (first month) + $1,040,000 (second month) + $1,040,000 (third month) is incorrect since the number of employees increased each month. 
The correct calculation is:
(200 * $4000) + (220 * $4000) + (240 * $4000) = $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their respective hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's starting wage was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a $0.50 raise, making his wage $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another $1.00 raise, making his current wage $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230
Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to determine the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, so the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

The percentage of stuffed goats will be (x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30%

To solve for 'x', we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 
(x / (14 + x)) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply: 
x = 0.3 * (14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides: 
0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7: 
x = 6

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so they consumed a total of 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed by the students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea to the total amount consumed:

10 quarts (remaining) + 38 quarts (consumed) = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:

"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. He then sold 150 candies, but since he didn't have them yet, this means he took orders for 150 candies. To fulfill these orders, he ordered 100 more candies. However, this still isn't enough to fulfill the 150 orders, so we can assume he will order more candies later.

The total number of candies Dale has ordered so far is 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

Since Dale took orders for 150 candies, and he now has 200 candies, we can subtract the number of orders from the total number of candies to find out how many he still needs to sell:

200 (total candies) - 150 (orders) = 50

However, this is the number of candies he has in excess of the orders. To find out how many he still needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we need to consider that he wants to sell all 200 candies. Since he already has orders for 150, he still needs to sell:

200 (total candies) - 150 (orders) = 50

Total branches = Total amount / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

The total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are two kids).

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, which is 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is: 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'z', the amount of fragrance as 'f', the amount of salt as 's', the amount of sugar as 'g', and the amount of oil as 'o'. 

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we have z = f.

Given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have s = g.

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, we have o = 2s.

Given that she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have s = 2z.

Now, we can express all the variables in terms of 'z'. Since s = 2z, we have o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. Also, since z = f and s = g, we have f = z and g = s = 2z.

Now, we can express the total amount of the mixture in terms of 'z': 
z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 ounces (since the total amount is 10 ounces).

Combine like terms: 10z = 10 ounces.

Divide both sides by 10: z = 1 ounce.

Now, we can find the amount of oil (o) in terms of 'z': o = 4z = 4(1) = 4 ounces.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to first calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot before lunch. 

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars were added to the parking lot. So, the total number of cars before lunch is 50 + 20 = 70.

It is given that 1/2 of the cars in the parking lot had gone during lunch. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate half of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars before lunch. So, 70 - 35 = 35.

Total number of cars: 35"
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to break down the problem into smaller components. 

First, we need to find out how much John earns per cycle. Since each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, we multiply the number of tasks per cycle by the payment per task:
5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task = $6/cycle

Next, we need to find out how much John earns per day. Since John does 30 cycles of work per day, we multiply the number of cycles per day by the payment per cycle:
30 cycles/day * $6/cycle = $180/day

Finally, we need to find out how much John earns per week. Since John works 7 days a week, we multiply the number of days per week by the payment per day:
7 days/week * $180/day = $1260/week

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can find the total points Sasha scored by adding her points in both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each person has. 

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick's cards can be represented as '3x'. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca's cards can be represented as '3x + 12'.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick's cards = 3x = 3 * 47 = 141

And we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca's cards = 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Becca has 153 cards."
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of eggs of each color and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the original cost of the book.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost based on weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
- The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The original cost of the book is $32.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- The total loss is the original cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost: $32 - $24 + $3.00 = $11.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate her total amount of money after receiving the $100 from her father, and then subtract the total cost of the items she purchased.

Mulan initially had $40. After receiving $100 from her father, she now has:
$40 (initial amount) + $100 (from father) = $140

The total cost of the items she purchased is:
2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 * $30 = $60
1 bag at $20 = $20
Total cost = $60 + $20 = $80

Now, subtract the total cost from the total amount of money Mulan had:

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total amount produced in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total amount produced in the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the amount produced in the fourth week is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities into hours and minutes, then convert everything to hours.

1. Recording TikTok videos: 
   18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   Convert minutes to hours: 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours/week
   For a month with 4 weeks: 1.2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 4.8 hours/month

2. Writing amateur songs:
   2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours/month

3. Doing makeup:
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   Convert minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
   For a month with 4 weeks: 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6 hours/month

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
4.8 hours/month (recording) + 8 hours/month (writing songs) + 6 hours/month (makeup) = 18.8 hours/month

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the items she needs installed and compare them to the items included in the initial installation package.

The initial package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional)
- 20 pictures (10 additional)

Since the initial package already includes 2 shelves, we don't have information about Angela needing shelves, so we won't include them in the calculation.

The cost for the initial installation is $129.00. For the additional items, we need to calculate the cost:
- 2 additional mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 additional chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 additional pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost for additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% of Anthony's savings to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance covered in the first part = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

In the second part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. 
Distance covered in the second part = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first part + Distance covered in the second part
Total distance covered = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance covered = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total time it would take one kangaroo to travel across the highway by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

Time taken by one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed and time are inversely proportional, if the turtles are traveling at half the speed, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance.

Time taken by one turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours per turtle.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by four turtles will be the same as the time taken by one turtle.

Time taken by four turtles = 12 hours.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in discount.

The laptop costs $600, but with the trade-in discount, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is $400 (price of laptop) - $50 (amount she needs) = $350.

Since Erika has $230 from her job and her mom, the amount she has in her purse is $350 (total amount she has) - $230 (amount from job and mom) = $120.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam initially had and then subtract the slices he ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam sliced 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam sliced 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of slices from the large and small apples to find the initial total number of slices. The initial total number of slices is 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30.

Finally, we subtract the slices Adam ate (15) from the initial total number of slices (30) to find out how many slices are left. The number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk his current cows produce. 

The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it has been used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it has been used.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60 socks

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total number of socks = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90 socks

2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)
4. A + B + S + M = 87 (When you add all our ages, you get 87)

We can express S in terms of A from equation 2: S = A - 2.

We can express M in terms of B from equation 3: M = 3B - 1.

We can express B in terms of A from equation 1: B = A + 3.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer tipped. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip per customer = $20
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80
Total tips for Julieta = $800 - $80 = $720

Now, we need to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received in tips.

Total tips = Total tips for Rafaela + Total tips for Julieta
Total tips = $800 + $720
Total tips = $1520

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she gave away and subtract that from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges to her daughters. She also gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

The total number of oranges she gave away is 6 (to her daughters) + 3 (to her boy) = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year: 36 (Wendy) - 6 (Amber) = 30.

"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the number of slices sold and multiply it by the price per slice.

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we first need to determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation where the number of gold coins equals the number of silver coins plus 30.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70. So, we can write the equation as:

70 = x + 30

To find the number of silver coins, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold and silver coins:

Total coins = 40 (silver coins) + 70 (gold coins)
Total coins = 110

Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George: 20 burritos
Total burritos consumed: 500 + 20 = 520 burritos

Now, subtract the total burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
600 (total burritos) - 520 (total burritos consumed) = 80

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Since the rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Given that the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. 

Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as:
S = A + 25

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as:
A = F - 12

We are also given that the total number of books is 85, so we can write this as:
A + S + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F. 

First, substitute S = A + 25 into the third equation:
A + (A + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00. 

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 
3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we first need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he will sell as follows:

Number of chickens to be sold = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180 chickens

We are given that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue from selling the chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens to be sold by the selling price:

Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken
= $9000

Since profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we can rearrange the equation:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and since Sarah is selling a 20-meter rope, we can assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length. So, the cost of the new rope is:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age means 3 times her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Let's assume that in 'x' years, her age will be 24 years. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Melanie's current age + x = 24
8 + x = 24

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

However, this 'x' represents the number of years from now when Melanie will be 24 years old. But we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Since her age will be 24 in 16 years, and she is currently 8 years old, we can subtract her current age from 16 to find the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her present age.

Number of years from now = 16 - 8 = 8 is incorrect, we are looking for the difference between the time it takes for her to be 24 and the time it takes for her to be 3 times her current age, which is 24. 
Melanie is 8 years old now, and in 10 years she will be 18. 
In 16 years she will be 24. 
In 10 years she will be 18, and 18 is not 3 times her current age. 
However, 24 is 3 times her current age. 
So we need to find the difference between 16 and 10, which is 6 years from the time she will be 18. 
So the correct answer is 10 + 6 = 16, but we are looking for the difference between 16 and 10, which is 6 years from now.

8 is incorrect, the correct answer is 6 + 10 - 10 = 6.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. Therefore, Kamala paid her 3 * $6 = $18.

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. Therefore, Alba paid her 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns. 
Total mowing earnings = Joe's payment + Kamala's payment + Alba's payment
Total mowing earnings = $6 + $18 + $30

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we need to first subtract the cookies taken by her husband from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many cookies each nephew will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's pages from yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. So, Denise's total pages read is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. So, Daniel's total pages read is 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of pages Denise and Daniel read. 
Denise read 28 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls the family will eat for dinner.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their two children will eat 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of child bowls eaten for dinner is 2 (adult bowls) * 2 + 2 (child bowls) = 6 child bowls.

The pot can fill 8 child bowls, so the leftover soup will be 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 2 / 2 = 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make: 20 / 4 = 5 sets. Since each set requires 2 yards of material, the total material needed for the small masks is 5 sets * 2 yards/set = 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make: 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets (round up to 3 sets since you can't make a fraction of a set, but in this case, we will calculate the exact amount needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards of material, the total material needed for the large masks is 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first determine the total number of tickets she purchased. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

We know that Deepa spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we can divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27

"To determine the amount of free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total number of hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day to find the free time:
24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (hours spent on activities) = 5 hours.

"To find the number of shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of blue and red shoe boxes used and subtract them from the total.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (used blue shoe boxes) = 4 blue shoe boxes

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, which is:
(1/3) * 9 (initial red shoe boxes) = 3 red shoe boxes

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (used red shoe boxes) = 6 red shoe boxes

The total number of shoe boxes left is the sum of the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
4 (blue shoe boxes) + 6 (red shoe boxes) = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find the total number of acres of both farms, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can calculate it as follows:

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to determine how many packages he completes per hour. It is given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so the number of packages he completes per hour is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, his hourly earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by his pay per package: 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

To find out his total earnings in an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works: $8 * 8 = $64.

"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we need to calculate the total time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide that by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle of water.

First, we know that an extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku. Since a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, an extreme sudoku takes 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we can divide the total time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku by 30 to find the number of bottles he drinks.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of pieces of bologna thrown at each type of balloon and the total number of pieces thrown.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, so the total number of pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We also know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * Y.

The total number of pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * Y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

Y = 6

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month and then divide that by the number of miles required for a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount they had initially is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will turn 10 years old. The difference between these two ages is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months.

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. 

First, let's calculate the total amount he spent on movies so far:
- 5 movies on Friday or Saturday: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
Total spent on movies: $50 + $56 = $106

Next, let's calculate the total amount he spent on snacks:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8
Total spent on snacks: $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate his total expenses so far:
$106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = $130

Colby's initial budget was $150, so his remaining budget is:
$150 - $130 = $20

Since he wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) on the last day, he will spend $10 on snacks. This leaves him with:
$20 - $10 = $10

Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10. Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough money to buy a ticket.

However, if we consider the question's wording, it seems to imply that he will get the popcorn and candy, and then see how many movies he can see with the remaining money. In that case, he won't be able to see any more movies on Fridays or Saturdays since the ticket costs $10 and he only has $10 left, which will be spent on snacks. But if we consider other days (which is not the case here since it's a Friday), the answer would be different.

Considering the given information and the day of the week, the answer is 0."
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can start by substituting the second equation into the third equation to express P in terms of J:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P and L into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = L + J

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month, so the total number of hours in a month is 24 * 30 = 720 hours.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 60 * 720 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, so in 720 hours, it will produce 45 * 720 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother spelled, we first need to calculate the total number of letters Craig spelled. Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. 

Total number of letters Craig spelled = 20 * 15 = 300

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total.

Total number of letters Craig's brother spelled = 300 + 50 = 350

Now, we add the total number of letters Craig and his brother spelled to find the overall total.

Total number of letters = 300 + 350 = 650

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles she has after redeeming the coupons. 

Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total cost of the job, we need to break it down into its components: the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: Since Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour or part thereof, we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor charge is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.
3. Parts charge: $60

Now, let's add up the costs: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he received from selling 5 of them, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs. James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, but he got them for 40% off. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.
The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.
So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the 10 CDs.

Now, let's calculate the amount he received from selling 5 of them. He sold 5 CDs for $40.

The amount he received from selling 5 CDs is $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he received from the total cost of the CDs.

The amount James was out is $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's calculate the initial swimming time. James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the initial swimming time is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The final swimming time is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

The total time it took James to cross the lake is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 per copy = $150 total sales
8% commission on $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission = Commission from the New York Times + Commission from the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12

"To find Leo's age, we first need to determine Marcus's age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus's age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that:
1. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
2. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)
3. A + B + D = 45 (The total points scored by the team)

From equations 1 and 2, we can express B in terms of A and D. Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. This implies that D = A + 10.

Now, we can substitute B and D in terms of A in the third equation:
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3A = 15

Divide by 3:
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches, which is 1.5 inches. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes spent stapling is 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to divide the total minutes by 15 and multiply by 30.

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60
60 * 30 reports = 1800 reports

"To determine the total minutes Kim slept in her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the 5 minutes she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She was also sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes. Subtracting this from her total sleep time, we get: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen (24) cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24
Number of measuring spoons = 16

Jonathan initially had 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons, for a total of 40 utensils. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:

Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6 = 10
Number of measuring cups remaining = 24 (no change)

Total number of utensils remaining = 10 + 24 = 34

"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first determine the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the final number of unoccupied beds.
Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 800 - 700 = 100 beds

"To find Shawna's father's age, we first need to determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that Courtney reported and then subtract 20% from it, as Kelly claimed that Courtney overstated the number by 20%.

Let's denote the actual number of people as 'x'. According to Kelly, Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means Courtney's number is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% overstatement).

We know Courtney reported 48 people, so we can set up the equation:

120% of x = 48

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
1.2x = 48

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.2:
x = 48 / 1.2
x = 40

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

Total number of balls: 7"
"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then multiply it by four to find the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, making the total 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2, making the total 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
X = S + 5

We are also given that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:
S = 4A - 13

Now, we can substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
A + 2S = 334

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the above equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334

Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 = 334

Combine like terms:
9A - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13:
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then find the net distance.

1. Distance traveled south in the first segment: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours 
Distance = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled north in the second segment: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours 
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance will be subtracted from the total distance traveled south.

3. Distance traveled south in the third segment: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours 
Distance = 110 miles

Now, let's calculate the net distance: 
Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first segment - Distance traveled north in the second segment + Distance traveled south in the third segment 
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old. 

To find his dad's current age, we subtract 5 years (the difference between Emil's current age and his age when he turns 24) from his dad's age at that time. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

We also know that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

To find his brother's current age, we subtract 5 years from his brother's age at that time. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the amount in one serving: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of the class are football players. 
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24 students.

Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of the band. 
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which includes football players, cheerleaders, and band members. 
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members
= 6 + 6
= 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can calculate the average size of the shoes worn by the two:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To determine how many flowers Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space required for each plant (30 inches) to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of 18. 

18 / 2 = 9

Since Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day, to find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply this number by 7 (the number of days in a week).

9 * 7 = 63

"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, then add them together.

For the petunias, Katherine needs 3 petunias per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, Katherine needs 2 vines per basket, and she has 5 baskets. So, she needs a total of 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost of filling the hanging baskets is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations, then subtract that from the total amount of soil available.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they planted 4 sunflowers, so the total amount of soil used by sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they planted 10 carnations, so the total amount of soil used by carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used by sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3.

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year and then divide it by the cost of each pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00, and she sets aside 25% of it for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year is:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we divide the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To determine the time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can set up a proportion:

30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 90 shrimp / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

30x = 90 * 10
30x = 900
x = 900 / 30
x = 30 minutes

However, this is the time it would take to cook 90 shrimp if Emily were cooking them in batches of 30. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, she can cook 90 shrimp in three batches of 30. Therefore, the total cooking time is:

3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp (15 minutes) to the time it takes to cook the shrimp (30 minutes):

15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time period.

Initially, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This results in a total warming of 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the total cooling effect minus the total warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad will see the Comet again 75 years later. However, we are interested in Bill's age, so we need to find out when Bill saw the Comet.

We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it for the second time. However, we are interested in when Bill saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the Comet for the second time at 90 years old, he must have seen it for the first time 75 years earlier.

So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of bill and add them together.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month, so 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year.
3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The total remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22/2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

Walter's friend gives him $200. However, this amount is not included in the total amount that the lawyer will match, as Walter only tells his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

The lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000."
"To find the number of people in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. 

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received: 750 / 15 = 50.

"To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of slices. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x'. Therefore, the size of each adult's slice would be '2x'.

We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices can be represented as 2(2x) + 4(x). This simplifies to 4x + 4x, which equals 8x.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total that each adult's slice represents. Each adult's slice is 2x, and the total is 8x. 

So, the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is 2x / 8x, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. With 9 inpatients and 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds is:
9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments and 30 minutes per appointment, the total time spent on appointments is:
10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these activities:
180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic to get the time left to update records:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first determine the total cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per month.

The total cost per session is the cost to rent the studio plus the cost per student. Since there are 10 students, the cost per session is:
$25 (rent) + $1.50 (cost per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month (assuming a 4-week month) is:
3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month:

"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines and then the number of babies they will give birth to in a year.

Given that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * Total population

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a year (12 months) is:

Number of babies per year = Number of female porcupines * Number of babies per month * 12
= 30 * 4 * 12

Now, we add the initial population and the number of babies born in a year to get the total population after a year:

Total population after a year = Initial population + Number of babies per year

Length (L) = 25 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet
Height (H) = 4 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 25 x 14 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons, we can multiply the volume by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons. However, the pool company instructed to multiply by 5.9, which might be an approximation or a specific conversion factor for their purposes.

Volume in gallons = 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly earnings are $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

"To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18
Total number of portraits and selfies = 45

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then multiply it by the number of pages he read.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the rate, we can divide the time by the number of pages: 10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page (approximately).

Now, we multiply the rate by the number of pages James read: 3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes.

"To determine the number of guests the hotel now has, we need to consider the changes in the number of guests throughout the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased to 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests elected for a late checkout, but this does not change the number of guests at this point.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. The number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then determine how many of those she is sure to get correct.

First, let's find out how many easy questions there are. 40% of 60 questions are easy, so:
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions by subtracting the number of easy questions from the total and dividing by 2:
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Total points Aries is sure to get: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We are given that S = 2L, since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa's total earnings from the sales are $120. This can be represented as the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To determine the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we can calculate the amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine per day with steel pickaxes:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day = 1440 pounds per day.

To find the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:
1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 
Price = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich 
Price = 8 * $1.5 
Price = $12

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

First, let's calculate the probability that he won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50% (or 0.5). In this case, he won't have to turn in his homework.

2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of having the normal teacher and getting an extension is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of having the normal teacher, not getting an extension, and getting a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of not having to turn in his homework:
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher with personal extension) = 0.76

Since the probability of not having to turn in his homework is 0.76, the probability of having to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.76 = 0.24.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:
0.24 * 100 = 24%

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 additional bottles. 

Now, we can calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains by multiplying the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each bottle:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed and the total amount of money he lost by not working while in school.

The total amount of money Jim borrowed is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

The total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is his previous annual income of $25,000 for 4 years, which is:

New length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

The area of the fabric piece is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2.

Area of one piece: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet
Total area for two pieces: 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days they worked. There are 7 days in a week, so:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the team:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is 10.

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch per weekend and then multiply it by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

Since they watch 4 movies every Saturday, and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

The total number of movies they watch per weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

There are 4 weeks, and each week has 1 weekend. Therefore, the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had initially, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 
100 (initial stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) + 100 (stickers collected this year) = 250

"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats consume per day and then divide the total amount of food available by this daily amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day. So, the total amount of food each cat consumes per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the daily amount (360 grams) to determine how many days it will last: 720 / 360 = 2.

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we first need to determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can calculate Jake's slices as follows:

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia's slices can be calculated as:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x' minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18' minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, the sum of Donovan's part and Betsy's part is equal to 98 minutes.

We can set up the equation as follows:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes:
Betsy's part = x + 18
Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The cost of the cast is $200.
The doctor's time is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Since the doctor charges $300/hour, the cost for 30 minutes is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
The cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas left, we need to find 30% of 20 (since 100% - 70% = 30%). 
30% of 20 is 0.3 * 20 = 6.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, so they ate 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas. 
The number of pizzas left for the football team is 40 - 32 = 8.

Now, we add the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team: 6 + 8 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons, and each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. 

Cost of small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
Cost of small coupons = 700 * 0.05
Cost of small coupons = 35

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.

Cost of big coupons = Number of big coupons * Cost per big coupon
Cost of big coupons = 1400 * 0.15
Cost of big coupons = 210

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage.

Total cost of postage = Cost of small coupons + Cost of big coupons
Total cost of postage = 35 + 210
Total cost of postage = 245

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows: 
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of successful trucks by the tons of fertiliser per truck to find the total tons of fertiliser delivered:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers: 300"
"To determine the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we first need to calculate the total number of pounds Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for one pound at full price ($4.00) and the second pound at half price ($2.00). 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 

To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of each set ($6.00) by the number of sets (3).

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. The total number of invited guests is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests attending the party is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee covers 20 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since 315 bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total number of bananas eaten per day.

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten per day.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it will arrive 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it will arrive 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it will arrive 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:

Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 * $2000
= $1500

Now, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. Since he sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, we can calculate it as follows:

Price Mr. Rogers sold it = 120% of $1500
= 1.2 * $1500
= $1800

Now, let's calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:

Percentage discount = ((Original price - Price friend bought it) / Original price) * 100

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: walking halfway to the store, walking back home, and then walking the entire distance to the store.

1. Walking halfway to the store: Since James' home is 4 miles from the store, halfway would be 2 miles. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk halfway.

2. Walking back home: Since he walked 2 miles to get halfway, he needs to walk the same distance back home. So, it would take him another 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk back home.

3. Walking the entire distance to the store: After walking back home, James needs to walk the entire 4 miles to the store. At a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take him 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour to walk to the store.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the extra learning time on weekends.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes per day. John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes, making a total of 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes per day is 8 * 40 = 320 minutes.

Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on weekends. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on both Saturday and Sunday. So, the total extra learning time per week is 2 * (1/16) * 10080 = 1260 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to find the total time spent learning per week. The total time spent learning per week is 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex must have been twice the amount the Allosaurus ate. 

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate must have been twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

Therefore, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they travel to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To determine the number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works:
50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:
6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people who arrived in cars and buses, and then add them together.

Number of people who arrived in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people
Number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Total number of people who arrived at the church: 60 people + 420 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the people who arrived at the church were the ones inside the church. However, we also need to consider the bride and groom, who were also inside the church. 

So, the total number of people inside the church is: 480 people + 2 people (Mary and John) = 482 people

"To find Jeff's age, we need to first determine Martha's age. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To determine the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides. 
Time difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to first calculate the daily time spent on them. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total daily time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Adding the lunch time, the total daily time spent is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total daily time spent on lunches and breaks is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making the new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. After returning an item that cost $15.00, her new balance would be:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan would be:

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

So, the price of the frying pan after the discount would be:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels would be:

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

So, the price of the towels after the discount would be:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total amount she spent on the new purchases would be:

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Adding this amount to her previous balance, we get:

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

New balance: $113.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

We also know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Since only the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to first determine Ben's age, since Caroline's age is related to Ben's. 

We know Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. So, Ben's age is 2 * 4 = 8 years.

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, Caroline's age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her living expenses for that period. To calculate her retirement savings goal, we can multiply her desired annual retirement income by the number of years she plans to be retired:

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal, assuming she continues to save 20% of her annual salary:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we'll assume she's starting from scratch. However, to provide a more accurate answer, we would need to know how much she has already saved. Assuming she hasn't saved anything yet, she would need to work for 40 years to reach her goal.

However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work. If we assume she has been working for some time and has some savings, we would subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years needed to reach her goal. Unfortunately, without knowing how much she has already saved or how long she has been working, we can't provide an exact answer.

However, if we assume she hasn't saved anything yet and needs to work for 40 years to reach her goal, and considering she wants to retire in 20 years, we can subtract the retirement period from the total number of years needed to reach her goal:

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it will take the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fish.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 male fish. Tate bought 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, so the new total of male fish is 7 + 2 + 2 = 11.

Initially, there were 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 7 + 5 = 12 female fish. Tate bought 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so the new total of female fish is 12 + 1 + 3 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fish by subtracting the number of male fish from the number of female fish: 16 - 11 = 5.

"To calculate the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their task. 

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. 
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. 
Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we can calculate the total time by adding the time each person took to complete their task. 
Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time 
Total time = 4 + 6 + 8 
Total time = 18

"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we calculate the distance of the one-way trip. We know the time taken (2 hours) and the speed (70 mph), so we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Round trip distance = 2 * 140 miles
Round trip distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

Total miles per month = 2 * 280 miles
Total miles per month = 560 miles

"To determine the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply the daily distance by 7.

Total distance walked by Sofie in 7 days = 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up an equation to find the total distance walked by Brian in 7 days.

Let x be the total distance walked by Brian in 7 days.
Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can write the equation as:
70 miles = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.
x = 70 miles / 2
x = 35 miles

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The two workers who produce 6 toys per hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. 

The two workers who produce 4 toys per hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and any additional work done after the 10-hour shift will need to produce 400 - 200 = 220 toys. However, we are told that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, so the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 20 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's two dogs and add it to the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 pounds * (1/4) = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is:
60 pounds * (1/2) = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards. 

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially. 

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we first need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M's in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's in each small bag, which is 10. 

So, the total number of small bags John can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to calculate half the circumference of the earth and then divide it by the distance Alfie flies in a day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * 600
Speed of fastest car = 750 miles per hour

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first determine his age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago can be calculated as follows: 
14 (Liam's age two years ago) / 2 = 7 years old.

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 
7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since their total is 30, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted:
Camden - Arnold = 21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by the number of crayons per box (8). 

200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the combined weight: 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we calculate the portion of the tree that can be used to make logs: 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.

Since each log is 4 feet long, the total number of logs is: 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

From each log, John can make 5 planks, so the total number of planks is: 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank: 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the individual salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is the sum of their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Grandma's speed on the beach and then use that information to calculate her speed on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, we can set up the equation:

2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes

x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 0.05 miles/minute

Now, we know that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles/minute = 0.1 miles/minute.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is:

1 mile / 0.1 miles/minute = 10 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach (40 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (10 minutes):

Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of $4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $28.

To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4).

$28 / $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

Total number of blue birds: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. We are given that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. 

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as 'x'. We can set up the equation: x + 24 = 60. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24, x = 36.

Now that we know Bob currently has 36 marbles, we can determine how many marbles he will have if he loses 10. We subtract 10 from 36: 36 - 10 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of heat transfer and the final temperature of the mixture. When Donny pours water from the two mugs into his water bottle, the resulting temperature will be a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.

Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x. We know that the final temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

We can set up an equation based on the weighted average of the temperatures:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x) = (5 oz * 40°F)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Since the question asks for the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can conclude that the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of animals and the additional animals brought in by Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20
Total initial animals: 50 + 20 = 70

Number of cows brought in per day by Milkie Cows Limited: 20
Number of chickens brought in per day by Broilers Limited: 10
Total number of animals brought in per day: 20 + 10 = 30

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days in 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Total number of animals brought in over 21 days: 30 * 21 = 630

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the total number of animals brought in:
Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 70 + 630 = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell will receive a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs with 9 bagels each, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate and then convert that to the number of potatoes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, which means there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 jellybeans.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9 blue jellybeans.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, the total number of lemons he collects per year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

There are 10 years in a decade, so the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the initial number of women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by the total parts in the ratio (14) to find the value of one part. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

Initial number of women = 6 * 9 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since Faraday operates for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday operates for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 individual sunflowers + 252 sunflowers in bouquets = 291 sunflowers

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:

Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:

Number of rocks sold = Total number of rocks * 0.6
= 20 * 0.6
= 12 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 12 rocks:

Total revenue = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the amount of money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

Amount of money lost = Total cost - Total revenue
= $100 - $84
= $16

"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then find the total number of days.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days required to complete all the scenes. We can do this by adding the number of days required for each type of scene, but this would not be the most efficient way. Instead, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days required for each type of scene or simply add the days required for each scene type, taking into account that some days can be used to work on different scenes.

However, a more efficient approach is to calculate the total number of days by considering the total work required. We can calculate the total work in terms of ""scene-days"" (the number of scenes multiplied by the number of days required to draw one scene of that type). 

Total work = (45 large scenes * 1/5) + (36 medium scenes * 1/6) + (49 small scenes * 1/7) 
Total work = 9 + 6 + 7 
Total work = 22

However, this approach doesn't take into account that Lauren can work on different scenes on the same day. To find the minimum number of days required, we can try to combine the work.

One way to do this is to first calculate the number of days required for the large and medium scenes: 
9 days for large scenes and 6 days for medium scenes. We can combine these by working on large scenes for 6 days (30 large scenes) and medium scenes for 6 days (36 medium scenes), and then work on the remaining large scenes (15 scenes) for 3 more days.

Now we have 9 days for large and medium scenes. We still need to work on 49 small scenes, which would take 7 days. However, we can work on small scenes on the same days we work on large scenes. 

So, we can work on small scenes for the first 7 days (49 small scenes) and on large and medium scenes for 9 days. Since we can work on small scenes and large/medium scenes on the same day, the total number of days required is the maximum of the two: max(7, 9) = 9 days for small and large/medium scenes, but we still have 3 days of large scenes left to complete after the 6 days of large and medium scenes, so we add those 3 days.

9 + 3 = 12 days for large and medium scenes and 7 days for small scenes, but we can do the small scenes in the first 7 days of the 9 days for large and medium scenes, so we add the 3 days for the large scenes to the 7 days for the small scenes and the 6 days for the large and medium scenes, but the 6 days are already included in the 7 days for the small scenes.

So the total number of days is 7 + 3 = 10 days for the small scenes and the large scenes and the 6 days for the large and medium scenes are included in the 7 days for the small scenes.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, which has a 20% chance of winning, we can calculate the probability of the second ticket winning as follows:

Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 * Probability of the first ticket winning
= 3 * 20%
= 3 * 0.2
= 0.6
= 60%

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of the first ticket winning * Probability of the second ticket winning
= 20% * 60%
= 0.2 * 0.6
= 0.12
= 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first determine the total number of seashells collected. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). 

On weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots per day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 5 * 4 = 20 carrots.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots per day, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is 2 * 5 = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To calculate the length of the second song, we need to find 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of the two songs:

Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

"To calculate Linus' profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue from selling the mobile devices.

The cost of each device is $20. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

Linus sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40 per device. The total revenue is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. 

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, the additional number of bottles they need to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple, blue, and bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of babies wearing purple is:
8 * (3/4) = 6

The number of babies wearing blue is:
8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's calculate the number of babies wearing bows. All blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows:
6 * (1/3) = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies with bows, multiplied by 100:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received in the week.

Total reports received in the week = 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received in the week to find the reports received on Wednesday:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

"To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.

2. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.

3. Now, let's calculate the remaining land: 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

4. He sold the remaining 20 square meters of land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13. 

Now, we know that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3.

"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses per day and then multiply it by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks he uses per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Since we want to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to first determine the total number of eggs hidden and then subtract the number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by the children: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. 
So, his weekly earnings are 1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $.40/collection = 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the production for each year.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total production for 10 years:
- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0
- Year 10: 1000
- Years 1-4: We don't have information about these years, but since the question asks for the total production during its 10 years of life, we can assume the tree starts producing fruits from year 5. If we consider the production from year 1 to 4, it would be 0 since the tree starts producing fruits from year 5.

Total production = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount of money Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we can divide $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial amount of $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

Given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Length of blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we know that each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount x.

After giving x dollars to their little sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are also told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means that $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

To solve for x, we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15
$15 - x = $12
x = $3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:

Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - $3
= $2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that half the mural is yellow. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of that would be 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the mural (6 pints) is divided equally among the three colors: red, white, and purple. To find the amount of each color, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3.

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints per color.

Since we are looking for the amount of red paint used, the answer would be the amount of red paint, which is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine the total number of pods in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we calculate the number of additional pods as follows:
20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

Now, we add the additional pods to the original number of pods:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The new box contains 120 pods and costs $12. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost:
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide $1200 by $5.

$1200 / $5 = 240

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
Total goals: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the amount of chalk used each day and the remaining chalk after each day.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. The remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day, we can calculate the amount of chalk used each day as 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches (initially). However, this amount will decrease as the chalk gets smaller.

We can calculate the number of days the teacher can use the chalk as follows:

Day 1 (Tuesday): 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches remaining
Day 2 (Wednesday): 2.20 - 0.44 (0.20 * 2.20) = 1.76 inches remaining

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to find out the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk and then determine the amount he is eligible for a refund.

The total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon. 
Total amount = 4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000.

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount to determine the refund.
Refund amount = 2/5 * Total amount = 2/5 * $14,000 = $5,600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write the equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write the equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find the cost per book, we divide $500 by 100 books:

$500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book:

$27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find the number of books per school:

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples. He put all but 1 in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now, he has 5 (previously in his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11 apples.

Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home. Since we already know he has 11 apples, we don't need to consider any additional apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the number of 50 kg bags he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per unit.

First, let's calculate the number of bags: 
Total weight of coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight per bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total weight of coal ordered / Weight per bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost per unit = $18
Number of units = 17
Total cost = Cost per unit * Number of units
Total cost = $18 * 17
Total cost = $306

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices required is 10 slices per friend * 6 friends = 60 slices.

Now, let's calculate the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas needed separately.

For cheese pizzas, each pizza has 12 slices. To find the number of cheese pizzas needed, divide the total number of cheese slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 slices. 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

For pepperoni pizzas, each pizza has 8 slices. To find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed, divide the total number of pepperoni slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 slices. 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so the total miles for these days are 5 + 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per hour, we can multiply the melting rate per 15 minutes by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour). This gives us 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melting per hour.

Now, we can calculate Jay's net snowball production rate per hour by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: 20 (building rate) - 8 (melting rate) = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by the net production rate (12 snowballs per hour): 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is currently 28 years old, and the Digimon anniversary is 20 years after the initial event, we can calculate John's age at the time of the event.

John's age at the time of the event = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

It is given that John was twice as old as Jim at the time of the event. So, we can calculate Jim's age at the time of the event.

Jim's age at the time of the event = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed since the event.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24 years old

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means that before the third day's order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages (50) and used 38 bandages. So, before the first day's order, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left from the second day, and 31 + 38 = 69 bandages used and left from the first day. Since they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and multiply it by her hourly rate, then add the additional amount for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her total earnings from hours worked is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance. So, she receives:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Her total earnings for April is:
$270 (from hours worked) + $40 (from complete attendance) = $310

"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he performed that task, and then add up the results.

- Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry and did it once, so he earned $3.00 for laundry.
- Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room and did it once, so he earned $1.50 for cleaning his room.
- Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out and did it twice, so he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50 for taking the trash out.
- Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher and did it 6 times, so he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00 for emptying the dishwasher.

Now, let's add up the total amount Jason earned: $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning his room) + $1.50 (taking the trash out) + $3.00 (emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * Amount of blood in a whale
Amount of blood in a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Amount of blood in a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * Amount of blood in a shark
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total amount of blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. So, the total number of people at this point is 50 + 40 = 90.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80. So, the total number of people now is 90 + 80 = 170.

By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so 3 times that number is 3 * 50 = 150.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It is given that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens.

Since each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, we can verify this by dividing the total number of black pens by 5. 50 black pens / 5 pens/pack = 10 packs of black pens.

Now, we can find the total number of pens by adding the number of red pens and the number of black pens. Total pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of each bottle of scotch and then the cost of each bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of each bottle of scotch, which is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total White Oak trees planted on the second day 10. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:

Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 10 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8, which simplifies to 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4, which simplifies to x = 8.

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Since we need to find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of John's class = 1/8 * 120 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:

Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15 = 30 students

The total capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school
= 120 + 30
= 150

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount he owes is the sum of the borrowed amount and the interest.
Total amount = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we subtract the total paid in 11 months from the total amount to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.
Amount paid in the twelfth month = Total amount - Total paid in 11 months
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $31

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed per day for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so Jordan also changes half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar and then find the estimated number of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying the base area by the height: 
Volume = base area * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
Actual volume = Volume * 0.8
Actual volume = 540 * 0.8
Actual volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar:
Total jelly beans = Actual volume / volume of a single jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true and estimated number of red jelly beans:
Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

In the initial 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the initial 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 5 * 3 * 2 = $30

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the subsequent 3 years, Pauline continued to visit the museum 3 times a year, and the new cost of one visit is $5. So, the total cost for the subsequent 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 3 * 3 * 5 = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is the sum of the costs for the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and divide them into groups of 8.

There are 4 grades (4-7), and the top 10 students from each grade get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups:
40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

Each group uses their full 45 minutes, so the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:
5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces will be equal to the total length of the board.

We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs. 

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs (80) by the number of meatballs per pound (16) to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden will use 5 pounds of ground beef, we can calculate the amount of seasoning needed. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets two treats, and there are five people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. 

The original price of the manicure is $35, and the original price of the pedicure is $40. The total original price is $35 + $40 = $75.

Since the salon offers 20% off if you get both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.
$75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3.
10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art to get the total cost.
$60 + $30 = $90.

Next, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year, so we add that to the total:
36 issues/year + 6 issues/year = 42 issues/year

Lastly, the last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is:
4 * 6 issues/year = 24 issues/year

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, and Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can calculate Kim's total by subtracting 8 from Shelley's total.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the discount.

The initial price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%, which means the price became 180% of the original price (100% + 80% increase). 

Price in December = 40 * (180/100) 
Price in December = 40 * 1.8 
Price in December = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, which means the price became 50% of the price in December (100% - 50% decrease).

"To find the percentage of the distance covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. 

Since Michael is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to calculate the total hours he has traveled in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael has traveled by multiplying his average speed by the total hours traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr 
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100:
Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100 
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Since the sixth side is already solved once the fifth side is done, we don't need to add any extra time for it.

"To find the total number of items, we need to determine the number of robots and footballs based on the given information about the helmets.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. Given that there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70.

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he works in a week and then convert that to minutes. 

Since Tim works 6 hours a day, in a 5-day work week, he works 6 * 5 = 30 hours. 

Now, we convert the total hours to minutes: 30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes.

We know it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call. To find out how many calls he deals with in 1800 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call: 1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls.

"To determine the difference in drying time between the old varnish and the new varnish for 6 paintings, we need to calculate the total drying time for each varnish type and then find the difference.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be 7 minutes * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be 12 minutes * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time, we subtract the total drying time of the old varnish from the total drying time of the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water requirements for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. Since half a cup is 0.5 cups, we multiply 4 plants by 0.5 cups: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left that require a quarter of a cup of water. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants, the remaining number of plants is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These 8 plants require a quarter of a cup of water each, which is 0.25 cups. So, we multiply 8 plants by 0.25 cups: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add the water requirements for all the plants together: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the distance on land and in water separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time taken to cover the distance on land + Time taken to cover the distance in water
Total time taken to return home = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time taken to return home = 15 minutes

"To determine the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. 

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs half the cost of the main phone. 

Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2 = $10

There are 4 additional phones. 

Cost of additional phones = 4 * $10 = $40

Total cost of the whole phone plan = Cost of main phone + Cost of additional phones
Total cost of the whole phone plan = $20 + $40
Total cost of the whole phone plan = $60

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts made per day. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of doughnuts made per day is:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts sold per day is also 120.

Next, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts sold in June:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

"To determine the number of days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we first need to calculate the total number of batches she will upload. 

Since Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch, we divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos per batch (7). 

210 / 7 = 30 batches

Now, we know Jade uploads 6 batches each day. To find out the number of days, we divide the total number of batches (30) by the number of batches per day (6).

30 / 6 = 5 days

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply 150 WPM by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words, we divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people was 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the total number of people was 2 * 70 = 140.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since it's an average, we can assume the number of people was the same each day, so the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the number of people Conor saw each day:
50 (day 1) + 70 (day 2) + 140 (day 3) + 240 (days 4-7) = 500

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 500"
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels:

"To determine the number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the regular gallons of lemonade and the extra gallon that is twice as tart.

For the 4 regular gallons of lemonade, the amount of lemon juice required is 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups.

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, the amount of lemon juice required is 2 * 1 cup = 2 cups.

The total amount of lemon juice required is 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed is 6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to first calculate the daily consumption of dog food by all the dogs.

There are 3 German Shepherds, each consuming 5 kilograms of dog food per day, so their total daily consumption is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

There are 2 Bulldogs, each consuming 3 kilograms of dog food per day, so their total daily consumption is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of dog food by all the dogs is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The 2-legged animals have a total of 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have a total of 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since we are asked for the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 (since each pair consists of 2 legs): 80 / 2 = 40 pairs.

"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled west and then subtract the distance he traveled east, as he is essentially backtracking.

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
Distance traveled east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house.

Net distance from house = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance from house = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance from house = 54 miles

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. 
The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

$80 * 3 = $240

The cost of each bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is:
$80 * 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is:

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. Since Dallas dropped 4 marbles and ended up with 21, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas initially received by adding the dropped marbles to the remaining marbles.

Dallas initially received 21 (remaining marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles.

Now, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles and gave 25 to Dallas. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles given to Dallas from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Marbles given to Dallas
Marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25

Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To calculate the discount, we need to find 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. The discount is $16, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total amount is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
$6 * 3 = $18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
$1.25 * 4 = $5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings:
$18 - $5 = $13

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket:
$13 / $6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 1 jar is 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12. 
The cost of jackfruit for 1 jar is 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12. 
The cost of honey for 1 jar is 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20. 

The total cost of making 1 jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. 

The total cost of making 10 jars is $44 * 10 = $440. 

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is $50 * 10 = $500. 

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $500 - $440 = $60.

"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). In 2 weeks, he is open 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the changes in the number of cookies of each flavor.

Initially, Randy had:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has a total of 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection separately and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of the collection would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy. So, the earnings from this half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy. So, the earnings from this half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's average enrollment as follows:

Butler High School's average enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School's average enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Norman High School's average enrollment - Butler High School's average enrollment
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000

Total number of cookies made = 7995
Total number of rainbow cookies = 2595
Total number of oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes Igor gathered. 

Since Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

We know that Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which is 7. However, he lost some of them on the way to the lab bench.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as x. Then, the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is 7 - x.

We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29
31 - x = 29

Now, solve for x:

-x = 29 - 31
-x = -2
x = 2

Number of beakers Igor lost: 2"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, and he needs 32 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of eggs in both baskets by adding the number of eggs in each basket.

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20
Total number of eggs = 30

Sarah raised $300. 
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if we denote Vanessa's speed as 'V', then Aaron's speed would be '2V'. 

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we know Aaron's distance (2 miles) and his time (16 minutes). We can use this information to find Aaron's speed. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes
Speed = 1/8 miles per minute

Since Aaron's speed is '2V', we can set up the equation:
2V = 1/8 miles per minute
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find her time using the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 200 feet * 3 = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total amount required to find out how much more line he needs to buy.

Line to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line to buy = 600 - 6
Line to buy = 594

"To calculate the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price of each watermelon and then apply the 25% profit margin.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we apply the 25% profit margin to the cost price to find the selling price of each watermelon:

Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 * $1.60
= $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to first determine the current age of the youngest son. 

Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate Dora's current age. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is now 18 years old. This means that John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. To find the current age of the youngest son, we subtract 32 from John's current age: 37 - 32 = 5 years.

To find the age of the youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in 60 minutes.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic's labor costs $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours.

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 + $150 = $230

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by isolating 'w' in the first equation:

w = 20 - c

Substituting this expression for 'w' into the second equation, we get:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70

Combine like terms:

-2c + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2c = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
