"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs and bakes 4 eggs. So she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

She has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

So she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to know how many bolts of white fiber are needed. It says half that much white fiber, so we need to find half of 2. Half of 2 is 1.

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to find the selling price of the house first. The house was worth $80,000 and then Josh put in $50,000 in repairs. So the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 100% (the original value) + 150% (the increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value of the house was $80,000. So the new value is 250% of $80,000. To find 250% of $80,000, we multiply $80,000 by 2.5 (because 250% is the same as 2.5). 

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

So the new value of the house is $200,000. Josh's profit is the new value minus the total cost. 

Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 x 3 = 9 sprints a week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters: 9 x 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she gives in total. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total cups of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total cups of feed needed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20

"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay, we need to find out how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost 60% of $5.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can say that every odd-numbered glass costs $5 and every even-numbered glass costs 60% of $5.

There are 16 glasses in total. So, there are 8 odd-numbered glasses and 8 even-numbered glasses.

The 8 odd-numbered glasses cost $5 each, so they cost 8 x $5 = $40.

The 8 even-numbered glasses cost 60% of $5 each. 60% of $5 is 0.6 x $5 = $3. So, the 8 even-numbered glasses cost 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the odd-numbered glasses and the even-numbered glasses to find the total cost. $40 + $24 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

"Carla can download 2 GB per minute. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. To download 80 GB, Carla takes 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

Then the computer restarts and Carla has to start over. So Carla downloads the whole 200 GB file. To download 200 GB, Carla takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 

But Carla already downloaded 40 minutes before the restart, and the restart took 20 minutes. So Carla took 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to find out how far he traveled in the 4 hours after he turned around.

In the first 2 hours, he didn't move because of traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.

In the next half-hour, he traveled at 30 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time. Since the time is half an hour, we need to convert it to hours. Half an hour is 0.5 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

In the remaining time, he traveled at 80 mph. The remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

So, in the 4 hours after he turned around, he traveled 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Now, let's find out how far he was from home when he turned around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Since he traveled 135 miles in the 4 hours after he turned around, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 
In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month, so 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. 
In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so it had 70% of the second month's downloads. 
70% of 180 is 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads. 
Now, we add the downloads from all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen. 
2 x $80 = $160

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. 
6 x $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate how much money he will make from selling lemons each year and subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree.

Each year, Carlos will make 7 x $1.5 = $10.50 from selling lemons.
Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.
So, each year, Carlos will make $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

Since the tree costs $90 to plant, we need to divide $90 by $7.50 to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money.

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to pay off the cost of planting the tree, but he will start earning money after 12 years."
"Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. A third of x is x/3. So she has x - x/3 left.

x - x/3 can be written as 2x/3.

Then she sold 2 more to the red house. So she has 2x/3 - 2 left.

Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (2x/3 - 2)/2 or x/3 - 1. So she has (2x/3 - 2) - (x/3 - 1) left.

(2x/3 - 2) - (x/3 - 1) is x/3 - 1.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So x/3 - 1 = 5.

x/3 = 5 + 1
x/3 = 6
x = 18

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 25% of 16 enrolled in jazz dance. 25% is the same as 0.25. So, 0.25 x 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left. These students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, we need to divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. 

12 / 20 = 0.6
0.6 x 100 = 60%

$5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and the market will go up 1.2%. 
To find 1.2% of $8,000, we multiply $8,000 by 0.012. 
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Now, we compare the profits. 
$125 (jewelry) is more than $96 (electronic gadgets).

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour. She works 15 hours a week, so she earns $30 * 15 = $450 per week from coaching.

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching: $700 + $450 = $1150 per week.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to find out how much time she has left and how much distance is left.

She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in 1 hour. So, she walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours.

The total distance is 12 miles. She has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. She has already walked 2 hours. To find the total time she should take, we divide the total distance by the average speed: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

She has already walked 2 hours. So, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left.

Now, we know she has 6 miles left and 1 hour left. To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find out how old Raymond is now and then subtract 23 from that.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 now, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age. 
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

"John bought blue ties that cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we need to divide $200 by $40. 

$200 / $40 = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 50% of $40 is $20. So the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

John bought 10 red ties at $60 each. To find out how much he spent on red ties, we need to multiply 10 by $60.

10 * $60 = $600

John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties. To find out how much he spent in total, we need to add $200 and $600.

$200 + $600 = $800

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120.
3/4 * 120 = 90

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units

Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
12 car tires cost 12 x $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday is $480

Since $520 is more than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add the pages from all his textbooks. 
4 pages from Science + 20 pages from Social Studies + 7 pages from History + 8 pages from Geography = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract those from the total pages. 
39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages left.

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days. 
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.

"John drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday. There are 5 weekdays. So, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water each day (with breakfast, lunch, and before bed) and has soda with dinner. There are 2 weekend days. So, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance the fog bank covers in 10 minutes.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. The city is 42 miles across. 

First, we need to find out how many groups of 3 miles are there in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

This means there are 14 groups of 3 miles in 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each group of 3 miles, we multiply the number of groups by 10 minutes.

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter is 1/4. So she places 1/4 of 1000 pieces. 1/4 of 1000 is 250.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third is 1/3. So her mom places 1/3 of 750 pieces. 1/3 of 750 is 250.

Now there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the length, width, and height of the box.

Length: 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches (because there's 1 inch on each side)
Width: 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the length, width, and height to get the inner volume of one box:
3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's break down the information we have. 

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night. That's 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 
So, in total for those days, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

We know Frankie watched 7 hours in all. So, on Wednesday, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes make 1.5 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 
90 minutes divided by 30 minutes per episode is 90 / 30 = 3 episodes.

"Let's think about this step by step. 

Henry baked some cookies last year. Let's call that number x. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many, so that's 2x. But he actually baked 15 more than that, so that's 2x + 15. 

Then he dropped 5 cookies, so we subtract 5 from 2x + 15. That's 2x + 15 - 5, or 2x + 10. 

We know that after all that, he had 110 cookies. So we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110. 

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can start by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation. That gives us 2x = 100. 

Then we can divide both sides by 2. That gives us x = 50.

"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to first find out how much the gas costs before the cashback rewards. 

The gas costs $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, the total cost will be 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

The app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon. So for 10 gallons, the cashback will be 10 x $.20 = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total by 2 (since there are 2 people): 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how many feet Julia rowed. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We also know the shore was 64 seconds away. 

First, let's find out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds. If she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, then in 64 seconds she rowed 64 / 16 * 20 = 80 feet.

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. So, for 80 feet, the boat took on 80 / 10 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 
1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"Sasha bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 for $10 each. So she spent 10 x $10 = $100 on them. Now the price is 50% higher, so the new price is $10 + 50% of $10. 50% of $10 is $5, so the new price is $10 + $5 = $15. She will sell them for $15 each.

She bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 for $16 each. So she spent 5 x $16 = $80 on them. Now the price is 50% higher, so the new price is $16 + 50% of $16. 50% of $16 is $8, so the new price is $16 + $8 = $24. She will sell them for $24 each.

She will sell the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for 10 x $15 = $150. She will sell the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for 5 x $24 = $120. So she will get $150 + $120 = $270.

She spent $100 + $80 = $180 on the boards. She will get $270. So her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find out how many parts of the ratio are sugar and how many parts are the total. 

The ratio is 7:13, so there are 7 parts sugar and 13 parts water. That's 20 parts in total (7 + 13 = 20).

Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in total. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to find out how many teaspoons are in each part. 

We can do this by dividing the total (120) by the total number of parts (20). 
120 ÷ 20 = 6

Now we know that each part is 6 teaspoons. Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6.

30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were added.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers added. 
20 / 5 = 4

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

"To find the answer, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary was $40000, then we can find Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (since 30% more is the same as multiplying by 1.3). 

Lylah's salary = Adrien's salary / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769 (round to the nearest dollar)

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We know his salary increased by 40%. To find the new salary, we multiply the old salary by 1.4 (since 40% more is the same as multiplying by 1.4).

Adrien's new salary = Adrien's old salary * 1.4
Adrien's new salary = $40000 * 1.4
Adrien's new salary = $56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. We know her salary increased, but we don't know by how much. However, the problem says their salaries increased simultaneously, so we can assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% more than what he was making four years ago, and his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40% more than what she was making four years ago.

Lylah's new salary = Lylah's old salary * 1.4
Lylah's new salary = $30769 * 1.4
Lylah's new salary = $43078 (round to the nearest dollar)

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their new salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56000 + $43078
Total salary = $99078

"To find out who gets home first, we need to find out how long it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles from school. We need to convert miles to feet because Steve's speed is in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile. So, 3 miles is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes for Steve to get home, we need to divide the distance by his speed. 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles from school. We need to convert miles to feet because Tim's speed is in feet per minute. 2 miles is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes for Tim to get home, we need to divide the distance by his speed. 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve gets home first. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we need to subtract the time it takes for Steve to get home from the time it takes for Tim to get home. 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

5 people came with bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires. So, 5 x 2 = 10 bicycle tires.
3 people came with tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires. So, 3 x 3 = 9 tricycle tires.
1 person came with a unicycle, and a unicycle has 1 tire.

Total tires inflated = 10 (bicycle tires) + 9 (tricycle tires) + 1 (unicycle tire) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find the total amount, multiply the number of tires by the cost per tire.
20 tires x 25 cents = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, we need to convert 500 cents to dollars.
500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's work backwards to find the answer. 

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. So before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. If 6 fries were left after the raccoon, then the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then 1/3 of x is 6. So x = 6 * 3 = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons ate three fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Each class is 2 hours long. So, he has 2 * 2 = 4 hours of classes each day on these days. There are 2 days like this in a week. So, he has 4 * 2 = 8 hours of classes on these days.

In a week, Kimo has 9 + 8 = 17 hours of classes. There are 16 weeks in a semester. So, in a semester, Kimo has 17 * 16 = 272 hours of classes.

Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches = 720 inches. 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.
Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet = 120 feet.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, running back and forth is like running 2 times the length of the field. So, Blake ran 15 x 2 x 100 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 2 x 100 yards = 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Running to the 40-yard line and back is like running 2 x 40 yards = 80 yards. So, Kelly ran 200 + 34 x 80 yards = 200 + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. So, Blake ran the most. To find out how much farther Blake ran than Kelly, we need to subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance.

"To find the price after 36 months, we need to find the price after 18 months (9 increases of 2 months each) and then multiply it by the increase for the last 18 months.

The price increases by 20% every 2 months. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4.
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $24.
20% of $24 is 0.2 * $24 = $4.80.
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80.
20% of $28.80 is 0.2 * $28.80 = $5.76.
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56.
20% of $34.56 is 0.2 * $34.56 = $6.91.
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.47.
20% of $41.47 is 0.2 * $41.47 = $8.29.
So, the price after 10 months is $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.76.
20% of $49.76 is 0.2 * $49.76 = $9.95.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71.
20% of $59.71 is 0.2 * $59.71 = $11.94.
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.65.
20% of $71.65 is 0.2 * $71.65 = $14.33.
So, the price after 16 months is $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.98.
20% of $85.98 is 0.2 * $85.98 = $17.20.
So, the price after 18 months is $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.18.
20% of $103.18 is 0.2 * $103.18 = $20.64.
So, the price after 20 months is $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.82.
20% of $123.82 is 0.2 * $123.82 = $24.76.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.58.
20% of $148.58 is 0.2 * $148.58 = $29.72.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.30.
20% of $178.30 is 0.2 * $178.30 = $35.66.

Time to peel and cut one potato = 1.5 minutes + 1/12 minutes. 
To add these, we need a common denominator, which is 12.

Let's say they made x gallons. Then they made $10x in total and spent $5x on making the lemonade. 

Their profit is $10x - $5x = $5x. We know their profit is $25, so $5x = $25.

To find x, we divide both sides by 5. x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we know there are 3 cages of rats and 15 rats in total. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we divide 15 by 3. 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest for the first month is 2% of $100. 2% is the same as 0.02. So the interest for the first month is $100 x 0.02 = $2. Now Mandy owes $100 + $2 = $102.

The interest for the second month is 2% of $102. So the interest for the second month is $102 x 0.02 = $2.04. Now Mandy owes $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

The interest for the third month is 2% of $104.04. So the interest for the third month is $104.04 x 0.02 = $2.0808. Now Mandy owes $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.12.

Mandy should give $106.12 to Benedict."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the bags and then subtract the cost of buying the bags and transporting them.

Let's say the trader bought x bags of wheat. He bought them at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the bags is 20x dollars. It costs $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost of transporting the bags is 2x dollars.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transporting them, which is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total amount of money he made from selling the bags is 30x dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the amount of money he made from selling the bags minus the total cost is $400. We can write this as:

30x - 22x = 400

This simplifies to:

8x = 400

To find x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

So the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The cost of the rides is 2 x $33 = $66.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen is 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

"Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, he has x + 2 white chickens.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so x red chickens will produce 3x eggs a day. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so x + 2 white chickens will produce 5(x + 2) eggs a day.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

First, we multiply 5 by (x + 2): 5x + 10. Now the equation is: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.

Next, we combine the x terms: 8x + 10 = 42.

Now, we subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32.

Finally, we divide both sides by 8: x = 4.

So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Let's think about this problem. 

The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, the small pool would lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water. The big pool would also lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water. The big pool has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

The problem says that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Let's solve this equation. 

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Now, let's add 16 to both sides of the equation.

2x = 4x - 48

Now, let's subtract 4x from both sides of the equation.

-2x = -48

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by -2.

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

There are 7 days in a week, so they eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce per week.

63 / 3 = 21

"To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to find out how many slices he needs in total. There are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices. 

20 friends * 4 slices = 80 slices

Now, we know that pizzas are sold in 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

1000 students were in the hall. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 
30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

So, 1000 - 300 = 700 students were left.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, we subtract the students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
700 - 420 = 280 students.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, he gets 2 * 5 = 10 pages from each pen pal per week. Since he has 3 pen pals, he gets 10 * 3 = 30 pages per week.

He responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week.

It takes him 6 minutes to write a page. So, it takes him 30 * 6 = 180 minutes to write 30 pages.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, he spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing per week.

"To find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums, we need to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. 
32 (snails in the bigger aquarium) - 4 (snails in the smaller aquarium) = 28

Now, we know that the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium 'x'. 
So, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The problem says that the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. 
So, 28 = 2 * 2x
28 = 4x
To find 'x', we need to divide 28 by 4.
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours the makeup artist worked and then multiply it by the hourly rate.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week. So, in a week, she works 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the makeup artist works a total of 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000. 10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * 30000 = $3,000.

So, Jean gets a discount of $3,000. To find out how much Jean paid, we subtract the discount from the total amount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate in total. Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday. So, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. So, her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many calories Sue consumed. 1 cookie has 200 calories. Sue ate 46 cookies. So, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 cookies. So, her sister consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. Sue consumed 9200 calories and her sister consumed 3600 calories. So, Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories.

"To heat up the oil to 300 degrees, it takes 20 minutes. 
To heat up the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. 
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. 
The total time to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 
It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 
So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken. 
The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, so the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. The whole sweater is 1800 stitches. 

So, the sleeves take 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. 

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But Sean only has to memorize a third of them, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize in the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of them, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines to memorize in the second scene.

Now, let's add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = (2 * 80) / 5 = 160 / 5 = 32.

So, 32 cards had the letter A. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48.

1/2 of the remaining had the letter B. 
1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 48 / 2 = 24.

So, 24 cards had the letter B. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24.

5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. 
5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = (5 * 24) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15.

For large holes, it takes 10 minutes per hole. Matthew needs to dig 15 large holes, so the total time for large holes is 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small and large holes: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 240 minutes to hours. We do this by dividing 240 by 60: 240 / 60 = 4.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide 39 by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza: 13 x 15 = 195 dollars.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches. So the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 1/4. To do this, we can multiply 17 by 4 (since 1/4 is the same as 4/1). 17 x 4 = 68.

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, we subtract these stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows.

Total stars on the flag = 76
Stars in 5-star rows = 76 - 36 = 40

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Let's say the number of players on the defense is x. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can write an equation: 
x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:
7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 30

"First, let's find out how many people Martha invited. 
She invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people.
She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people.
So, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, let's find out how many people couldn't come. 
8 people couldn't come due to illness.
1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 people.
So, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.

Now, let's find out how many people show up for Martha's party.
Martha invited 24 people, and 10 people couldn't come.
So, 24 - 10 = 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to find the volume of the pool first. The volume of a pool is found by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet

Volume = L x W x D
Volume = 6 x 4 x 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 x $0.1

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers, we need to find out how many junior programmers and senior programmers there are. 

The total number of employees is 100. Junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees. 
2/5 of 100 is (2/5) * 100 = (2 * 100) / 5 = 200 / 5 = 40. 
So, there are 40 junior programmers.

If there are 100 employees and 40 are junior programmers, then the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80000 + $144000 = $224000.

"To find the total time of the trip, we need to find the time it took to get to his friend's house and the time it took to get back home.

First, let's find the total distance to his friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles. So the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Since he drove at a speed of 70 mph, the time it took to get to his friend's house is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the time it took to get back home. The distance is 240 miles and he drove at a speed of 80 mph. So the time it took to get back home is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time of the trip is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, so they sold 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold half the amount they did the day before, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes. But 6 pairs were returned, so they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of shoes on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the pairs of shoes sold on each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50.

The store sold 50 pairs of shoes, but since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 x 2 = 100.

Millie has 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she has 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so she will make 36 x $1 = $36.

She spent $18 to buy supplies, so her profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find out her profit per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours she is open. So, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what 3/5 of the land is and then add it to the 12.8 hectares he has left.

Let's say Mr. Ruther had x hectares of land at first. He sold 3/5 of it, so he sold 3/5 * x hectares.

He has 12.8 hectares left, so the amount he sold is x - 12.8 hectares.

Since 3/5 * x is the same as x - 12.8, we can set up an equation:

3/5 * x = x - 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 5x - 64

Now, let's move the 5x to the left side:

-2x = -64

Now, let's divide both sides by -2:

x = 32

So Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Mel uses 900 watts of energy per hour. He uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. So, in a day, he uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts of energy.

Now, if he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. So, in a day, he will use 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts of energy.

The amount of energy he saves in a day is 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts.

Now, we need to convert watts to kilowatts. 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts. So, 4500 watts is 4500 / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many cookies Shannon needs, we need to multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights she wants them to last. 

She eats 2 cookies per night and wants them to last 30 nights. 
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

"To find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find out how many candles will smell like wet dog and how many will explode.

First, let's find out how many candles will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles smell like wet dog. To find 5% of 50000, we multiply 50000 by 0.05. 
50000 * 0.05 = 2500

Now, let's find out how many candles will explode. 1% of the candles will explode (since they are 99% guaranteed not to explode). To find 1% of 50000, we multiply 50000 by 0.01.
50000 * 0.01 = 500

Now, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since these are two separate things that can happen to a candle, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the percentage of candles that explode. But we need to find the percentage of candles that explode out of the candles that smell like wet dog. Since 1% of all candles explode, we can assume 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will also explode. So we multiply 2500 by 0.01.
2500 * 0.01 = 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount on each blouse. The discount is 30% of $20. 

30% of $20 is 0.3 x $20 = $6. 

So the discount on each blouse is $6. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price of each blouse. 

$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4.

$14 x 4 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. 
Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 apples.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 apples.

Now, let's add up the apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees:
Joanne: 30 + 15 = 45 apples
Her sister: 60 + 45 = 105 apples

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

But we want to know how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Since her sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples must have been gathered by Joanne.

"Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. 

We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. So the total number of humps is 2C + D.

We are given that the total number of humps is 304. So we can write an equation: 
2C + D = 304.

We are also given that the total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write another equation: 
C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D.

From the second equation, we can write D = 180 - C. 

Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 
2C + (180 - C) = 304.

Combine like terms: 
C + 180 = 304.

Subtract 180 from both sides: 
C = 124.

Now that we know C, we can find D: 
D = 180 - C = 180 - 124 = 56.

So there are 56 dromedaries.

"Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. So, he traveled 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers in the first 4 days.

Then, he traveled 30% of 800 kilometers over the next 2 days. 30% of 800 is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. Since he traveled this distance over 2 days, he traveled 240 / 2 = 120 kilometers per day.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, he traveled 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we subtract the cats taken by the boats from the total number of cats. 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5. 30 x 3 = 90, and 90 / 5 = 18 cats ran after the mouse.

Then, the normal price of $12 a month for 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since Bill is paying for 2 years, that's 24 months. He already paid for 6 + 8 = 14 months. So, he has 24 - 14 = 10 months left at $14 a month. That's 10 * $14 = $140.

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28. So the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Now we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. 1/3 of $6 is $2. So he saved $2 from the jogger jeans. 

The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, is from the tattered jeans. 

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 after the $2 savings, the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The tattered jeans cost $28 after the $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

Now we can find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $32. But the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. So the answer is - $8."

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the cards. 

Kenny spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have had $100 + $50 = $150.

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the total money he had ($150) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold. 

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

But Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total cards he had. 

Let's call the total number of cards he had 'x'. Then 2/3 of 'x' is 100. 

To find 'x', we can multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 2.

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound. So, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds. So, the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds. So, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds. So, the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Now, we know she needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer. Since she will run 2 km, we multiply 60 by 2.
60 * 2 = 120 ml

"First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 20% is the same as 20/100, which is 0.2. So she spent 0.2 * $500 = $100 on clothes.

Now, she has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 25% is the same as 25/100, which is 0.25. So she spent 0.25 * $400 = $100 on CDs.

Now, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Let's say the lot cost x dollars. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost 3x dollars. 

We know that the house and the lot together cost $120,000. So we can write an equation: 
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine the x's: 
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4: 
x = 30,000

So the lot cost $30,000. The house cost 3 times that, so the house cost 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

He gives half of the money to his sister, that's $160 / 2 = $80. 
So Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

He uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = (3 x $80) / 5 = $240 / 5 = $48.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to find out how much she pays per week before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
In a week, there are 7 days. 
So, her weekly electric consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts per week.

The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50. 
So, her weekly electric bill before adding the new device is 2016 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $3024.

Now, let's calculate her weekly electric bill after adding the new device. 
The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour a day. 
So, her new daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour.
In a week, her new electric consumption is 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts per week.

Her weekly electric bill after adding the new device is 2352 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt = $3528.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in total. He wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's say he saves x dollars each day in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

In the first half, he saves 15x dollars (15 days * x dollars per day). In the second half, he saves 15 * 2x = 30x dollars (15 days * 2x dollars per day).

The total amount he saves is 15x + 30x = 45x dollars. This should be equal to $1125.

Now, we add their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles for his sons.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide 20 by 5. 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. Each pack costs $3, so James spends 4 x $3 = $12.

"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week. So, Judy read for 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minutes are in 105 minutes. 

There are 105 / 1.5 = 70 sets of 1.5 minutes in 105 minutes. Since Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, she can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages. So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

He spent $10 x 4 = $40 on wooden action figures. He has $70 - $40 = $30 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend $10 each day on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. So, he will buy 10 / 2 = 5 plastic action figures each day for 3 days. That's 5 x 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so he grows 40 x 4 = 160 roses in a month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month they order 20 x 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month they order 15 x 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month they order 30 x 4 = 120 roses.

In total, the flower shops order 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses per month.

Now, let's find the cost of the carpet and padding. 
Cost of carpet = $12 per square foot 
Cost of padding = $2 per square foot 
Total cost of carpet and padding = $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. The directions say 2 pumps will give 120 washings. So, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the bottle will give 240 washings (2 x 120).

Since the bottle gives 240 washings and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, there are 240 pumps in the bottle.

Now, we need to find the cost of each pump. The bottle costs $24.00. We need to convert this to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $24.00 is 2400 cents.

Now, we divide the cost of the bottle (2400 cents) by the number of pumps (240). 

2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to first find the total cost of the outfit. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

But there's a 30% off sale. To find 30% of $60, we need to multiply $60 by 0.3. 0.3 x $60 = $18. So the discount is $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. $60 - $18 = $42.

Joe had $50. He spent $42. So, to find out how much money he has left, we subtract $42 from $50. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we need to first find out how many dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. He wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week. 

So, 4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants.

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to make 28 dozen croissants, we need to multiply 28 by 1/4.

28 * 1/4 = 28/4 = 7.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter."

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. 50% of $20,000 is $10,000, so the cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we need to find 25% of 100. To do this, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). 

100 x 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many of these riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who stay upright are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (since 60% is the same as 0.6).

Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60. If he goes to all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

But his parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class. So, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss so that the cost per class is still $10 or less.

Let's say Manny misses x classes. Then, he attends 10 - x classes. The cost per class is still $60, but now it's divided by the number of classes he attends.

We want the cost per class to be $10 or less, so we set up the equation:

$60 / (10 - x) ≤ $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

$60 ≤ $10(10 - x)

Now, we can divide both sides by $10:

6 ≤ 10 - x

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

-4 ≤ -x

Now, we can multiply both sides by -1:

x ≤ 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes or less, and the cost per class will still be $10 or less.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs.

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to divide the number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Lori needs.
24 eggs / 12 = 2.

Days to finish the book = 200 / 10
Days to finish the book = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to finish the book, and it will take him 20 days, we need to subtract 20 from 30 to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

Days before deadline = 30 - 20
Days before deadline = 10

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the plane and the cost of maintaining it for a year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting a hanger per month is $5000. For a year, it will be $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel per month is twice the cost of renting a hanger, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. For a year, it will be $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane and the cost of maintaining it for a year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to find the time it took to cook each item. 

First, we know it took 30 minutes to cook rice. 
Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

Now, we know the combined time to cook pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. 
Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook beans.

Now, we add the time it took to cook each item: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's think about this. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70. We also know that the total number of heads is 20. Since each animal has one head, there are 20 animals in total.

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. We know that S + G = 20 (total number of animals).

We also know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is 4S + 2G = 70.

Now, we can use the first equation to express G in terms of S: G = 20 - S.

We can substitute this into the second equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

This simplifies to 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide by 2: S = 15.

The final answer is: 15"

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. So, there are 90 history teachers.

Now, to find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Kassidy has $90, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150.

Now we know how much money each person has: Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150.

If they add their money together, they have 120 + 90 + 150 = $360.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, 2x = 18.

We also know there are 8 males, including Larry, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. 

The total number of dumplings the males ate is 8 x 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of dumplings the males and females ate to find out how many dumplings Larry cooked. 
18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50

"To find out how much money Gerald had, we need to divide the $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means we need to divide $100 into 3 + 2 = 5 parts. 

$100 ÷ 5 = $20 per part. Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, he had 3 x $20 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract $10 from $60. 
$60 - $10 = $50.

"If Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, that means the turtle is 1/5 as fast as the cat. 

The cat can run 15 feet/second. To find the turtle's speed, we need to divide the cat's speed by 5. 

15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the number of seconds.

3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise in total, we need to find out how much they raise per hour and then divide the total amount they need to raise by that amount.

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find out how much they raised per hour, we divide $2100 by 3 hours. 
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise $6300 at $700 per hour. 
$6300 / $700 per hour = 9 hours.

So, they have to fundraise for 9 hours in total to reach their goal.

"To find the answer, we need to find out how much water the city uses for non-industrial purposes. 

First, we know the city uses 40% of the river's water. Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%. 

40% is the same as 0.4 and 80% is the same as 0.8. 
0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes. Now, we need to find the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 40%. 

40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

In 48 hours, the factory can make 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in 1 hour, we divide 50 by 4. 
50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, the factory can make 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

"To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we need to first convert Topher's shoe length to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. 

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. 
8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches, Topher's shoe length is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. 
Let's say Bobby's shoe length is x inches. 
Then, 9 times Bobby's shoe length is 9x. 
10 inches longer than that is 9x + 10. 
This is equal to Topher's shoe length, which is 100 inches. 
So, we can write an equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 

Now, we need to divide both sides by 9: 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10

There are 4 weeks in a month, so in a month, 500 x 4 = 2000 chairs are rented. 
In 2 months, 2000 x 2 = 4000 chairs are rented.

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 9 large buttons. She also has 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of them for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 20 large buttons, 9 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons. 

She has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons."

"Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. 
Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. 
So, the total number of votes is also 33 (since each person gets one vote). 
The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, so we can write an equation:

Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. Then he bought 17 more fish. 

Let's say he bought x orange fish and y white fish. We know that x + y = 17.

After buying the fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the total number of orange fish is 3 + x and the total number of white fish is 4 + y.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write an equation: 3 + x = 2 * (4 + y).

Now, we can simplify the equation: 3 + x = 8 + 2y.

We also know that x + y = 17. We can rewrite this as x = 17 - y.

Now, substitute x = 17 - y into the equation 3 + x = 8 + 2y. We get 3 + (17 - y) = 8 + 2y.

Combine like terms: 20 - y = 8 + 2y.

Add y to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3y.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3y.

Divide both sides by 3: 4 = y.

Since we want to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

"Billy was paid $10 per hour at first. He got a raise of $0.50 after 2 months, so he got $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then he got another raise of $1.00, so now he gets $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so Sally gets $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Billy works 20 hours, so he earns $11.50 * 20 = $230. Sally works 20 hours, so she earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings. $230 - $210 = $20.

There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

There are 40 classes with 3 teachers in each class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers. 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.

Now, we know she has 14 stuffed animals. If she wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find out what 30% of the total number of stuffed animals will be after she buys the goats.

Let's say the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. Then the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We know that 30% of the total number of stuffed animals should be the number of stuffed goats. So we can write an equation: 
0.3(14 + x) = x

Now, let's solve the equation. 
0.3(14 + x) = x
4.2 + 0.3x = x
4.2 = 0.7x
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 x 7 = 14 days. 
Kris plays 14 x 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Kris played 7 + 14 = 21 hours in total.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
So Kris needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The third-graders who passed are 340 out of 500. 
The fourth-graders who passed are 40 out of 100. 
The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. 
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40% = 80%. 
The fifth-graders who passed are 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's add the number of students who passed in each grade: 
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

The total number of students is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips. Each bag has 72 chips. So, he has 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch. So, with 144 chips, he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make it, we need to divide the total square inches by the height.

Now, we add the quarts of tea the students drank: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left, so we add the quarts of tea the students drank to the quarts of tea left: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Now, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon. So, we divide 48 quarts by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long. So they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. In 240 minutes, they will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are 2 friends, they will use 24 x 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long. So he can play for 20 x 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter. In 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we know that the total is 10 ounces. So, we add all the parts together: 
x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine the x's: 10x = 10

Now, divide by 10: x = 1

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
Jack's socks: 30
Jack's dishes: 60
Peter's socks: 60
Peter's dishes: 30
Total: 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only. To find the students who are good at both math and English, we need to subtract the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at English only from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to know how many minutes the concert is and how many minutes each group takes. 

The concert is 2 hours long. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to get on, perform, and exit the stage.

There is also a 10-minute intermission. So, we subtract that from the total concert time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining concert time by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

Since I am 3 years younger than my brother, my age is B - 3.
My sister is 2 years younger than me, so my sister's age is (B - 3) - 2, which is B - 5.
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so it's 3B - 1.

Now, let's add all our ages: B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87.
Combine like terms: 5B - 9 = 87.
Add 9 to both sides: 5B = 96.
Divide by 5: B = 19.2, but since age is a whole number, we'll round it to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context. So, B is 19.

"Let's break this down. 

Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's. Since Joe paid $6, that means she mowed Joe's lawn once. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. If Joe paid $6 for 1 time, then Kamala paid 3 x $6 = $18.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. If Joe paid $6 for 1 time, then Alba paid 5 x $6 = $30.

So, Tasha made $6 from Joe, $18 from Kamala, and $30 from Alba. That's $6 + $18 + $30 = $54 from mowing lawns.

Tasha made $80 in total. If she made $54 from mowing lawns, then she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.

"To find out how much profit John makes, we need to find out how much money he makes from renting his car and then subtract his car payment.

John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, he rents his car for 10 x 3 = 30 hours a month.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so he makes 30 x $25 = $750 a month.

His car payment is $500, so we subtract that from the money he makes: $750 - $500 = $250.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to find out how many bowls of soup are left after dinner.

Calvin's pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

Since 1 adult bowl is equal to 2 child bowls, Calvin and his wife will eat 2 x 2 = 4 child bowls. Adding the 2 child bowls their children will eat, that's 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls in total.

The pot can fill 8 child bowls, and they will eat 6 child bowls. So, 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls of soup will be left.

Since there are 2 children, they will share the leftover soup. 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl per child.

"To make 20 small masks, we need to know how many sets of 4 small masks Jo can make. 20 small masks divided by 4 small masks per set is 5 sets. Since each set needs 2 yards of material, 5 sets will need 5 x 2 = 10 yards of material.

To make 8 large masks, we need to know how many sets of 3 large masks Jo can make. 8 large masks divided by 3 large masks per set is 2 with 2 left over. Since each set needs 2.25 yards of material, 2 sets will need 2 x 2.25 = 4.5 yards of material. For the 2 leftover large masks, we can't make a full set, but we can find out how much material is needed for 1 set and then multiply it by 2/3. 2.25 yards of material is needed for 3 large masks, so for 1 large mask, it's 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards. For 2 large masks, it's 0.75 x 2 = 1.5 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks. 10 yards for the small masks plus 4.5 yards for 2 sets of large masks plus 1.5 yards for the 2 leftover large masks is 10 + 4.5 + 1.5 = 16 yards.

He sold 5 CDs for $40. He paid $15 for each of those CDs, so he paid $15 x 5 = $75 for them. He sold them for $40, so he lost $75 - $40 = $35 on those CDs.

He still has 5 CDs that he paid $15 x 5 = $75 for. He paid $90 for all the CDs, and he got $40 for the ones he sold. So he is out $90 - $40 = $50 for the CDs he kept, plus the $35 he lost on the ones he sold. $50 + $35 is $85.

"To find the time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into parts.

First, James swims 60% of the distance. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Then, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. He swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time it took him to swim the remaining distance is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Now, we add up the time it took him to swim the first part, the time he rested, and the time it took him to swim the remaining part: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's break it down. 

Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. 
Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. 

So, if we say Dinar scored x points, then Bahati scored x + 10 points. 
And if we say Azibo scored y points, then Bahati scored y + 20 points.

Since Bahati scored the same in both cases, we can say x + 10 = y + 20.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all three is 45. 
So, x + y + (x + 10) = 45.

We also know that x + 10 = y + 20. 
So, y = x + 10 - 20 = x - 10.

Now, let's put y = x - 10 in the equation x + y + (x + 10) = 45.
x + (x - 10) + (x + 10) = 45.
3x = 45.

x = 15.

Now, we know Dinar scored 15 points. 
So, Bahati scored 15 + 10 = 25 points.
And Azibo scored 25 - 20 = 5 points.

Azibo scored 5 points."

But that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. That means she slept for 8 hours and 55 minutes, which is 8 * 60 + 55 = 535 minutes.

However, she woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes. So we need to subtract those 23 minutes from the total minutes she slept.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

Now, we know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, 40 - 29 = 11.

Since there are 4 hybrid sets, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 racquets worth of synthetic gut. So, the total time for synthetic gut is (3 + 2) * 15 minutes = 5 * 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. We also need to consider the hybrid sets, which are half polyester string. Since there are 4 hybrid sets, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 racquets worth of polyester string. So, the total time for polyester string is (5 + 2) * 22 minutes = 7 * 22 minutes = 154 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 racquets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's 12 checks.

He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, so that's 12 more checks.

He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks.

He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so that's 4 checks.

Now, let's add all the checks together: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52.

"The first plane's flights to Greece are 3/4 of its total flights. The remaining flights are 1/4 and are split equally between France and Germany. So, flights to France are 1/2 of 1/4, which is 1/8 of the total flights.

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we need to find 1/8 of 88. To do this, we can divide 88 by 8. 

88 / 8 = 11

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

Now, let's add up the time of all three wolves: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute. To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. 120 / 60 = 2.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to find the average age of the group first. We know the total age of the children is 20. 

We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So their total age is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract their total age from the total age of the group: 20 - 7 = 13. This is the total age of Helene and Wilfred.

We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. The total age is 20 and the number of children is 4. 

So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

Now, we know the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. We also know Helene is 10 years old. 

So, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids. So, the total number of slices is 2 x 2 (for adults) + 4 x 1 (for kids) = 4 + 4 = 8 slices.

The adults get 4 slices in total (2 slices x 2 adults). To find the percentage, we divide the slices the adults get by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

(4 slices / 8 slices) x 100 = 50%

So each adult gets 50% of the watermelon, but since there are 2 adults, we divide 50% by 2.

50% / 2 = 25%

He has 9 inpatients and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, 9 x 20 minutes is 180 minutes. We need to convert this to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

He also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, 10 x 30 minutes is 300 minutes. We need to convert this to hours. 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, Doctor Jones will spend 3 hours on rounds and 5 hours on appointments. That's 3 + 5 = 8 hours. 

He is spending 9 hours at the clinic. So, he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. 
3/4 of 4500 is 4500 * 3 / 4 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. 
2/3 of 4500 is 4500 * 2 / 3 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. 
1/3 of 3375 is 3375 / 3 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In total, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

24 / 3 = 8 

So, Richard can put 8 bottles of soda. 

Now, we need to find out how many times Richard will move from one bottle to the next. Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move 7 times to get to the 8th bottle. 

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. 

So, we multiply the number of times he moves (7) by the time it takes to move (5 seconds). 

7 * 5 = 35 

Total seconds: 35"

"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to calculate how much she spent on cheese. 

First, let's calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese. 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese cost 2 x $11 = $22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mozzarella cheese. 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese cost 3 x $6 = $18.

Now, let's add the cost of both cheeses. $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the cost of cheese from the initial amount. $50 - $40 = $10.

"To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the money he lost from not working while in school:
$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to earn $300,000 at his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years

"To find the size of the fabric Jim needs, we have to add 2 feet to the length and 2 feet to the width of the bed. 

The bed is 6 feet long, so the fabric needs to be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long. 
The bed is 8 feet wide, so the fabric needs to be 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, we need to find the area of the fabric. To do that, we multiply the length by the width. 
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2. 
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as 102 is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than 204 is 204 + 5 = 209.

On the first race, he lost $5. 
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Twice the amount he lost is 2 * $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. 
On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 1.5 times $11 is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's find the total amount he lost. He lost $5 on the first race and $16.50 on the third. He won $11 on the second, so we don't count that as a loss. Total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first convert Xavier's height to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between their heights. To do this, we subtract the smaller height from the bigger height. Since Cole is taller, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1.

Then the number of balls in the first set is x + 4. 
The number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that the total number of balls is 19. 
So, x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve this, we can multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

This is the same as 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine the x's: 5x + 8 = 38.

Now subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Now divide by 5: x = 6.

Now we know the second set had 6 balls.

First, James walked halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. Then he walked back home, which is another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. 

So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we divide the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet. So, we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how many inches it grows in 1 year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, we divide 8 by 4 to find out how many inches it grows in 1 year. 
8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply 2 inches per year by 13 years to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to know how many of each bike he sold and multiply that by the price of each bike.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes he sold. Half of 300 bikes is 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes he sold. 15% of 300 bikes is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of one BMX is half of that, so it's $500 / 2 = $250.

Now, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from each type of bike:
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add all the money Marcel earned: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

So, the farmer made 30 bales of hay and the truck picked up 18 bales of hay. To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

30 (bales made) - 18 (bales picked up) = 12

"There are 6 periods in a day for a normal student, but John has 2 extra classes. So, he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes a day. 

Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class each day.

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. So, he spends (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes on Saturday and (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes on Sunday.

So, he spends 100 + 100 = 200 minutes extra on Saturday and Sunday.

In total, he spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 1800 / 60 = 30 hours learning each week.

"To find the cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area a gallon of paint can cover.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons we need, we divide the total area by 20: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

Out of the 11 sodas, 3 were shaken and 8 were unshaken. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So now there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend will get sprayed if she picks a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas, so there are 2 + 6 = 8 sodas in total. The chance of Ellen's friend getting sprayed is 2 out of 8, or 2/8.

To find the percentage, we need to divide 2 by 8 and multiply by 100. 2 divided by 8 is 0.25, and 0.25 multiplied by 100 is 25.

Lauren wants to save for 20 years of retirement. So, she needs $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren is saving 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Now, let's see how many years it will take Lauren to save $800,000. We can divide the amount she needs ($800,000) by the amount she saves per year ($20,000). $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 x 2 = $30000 per month.

"Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach, we divide 40 minutes by 2 miles. 
40 minutes / 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile on the beach.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, it takes her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we know it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
So, to walk the whole 3 miles, we add the time it takes to walk on the beach (40 minutes) and the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk (10 minutes). 
40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 2 dozen is 24, so we can set up an equation: 
Bob's current marbles + 24 = 60

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has now. To do that, we subtract 24 from 60: 
60 - 24 = 36

So Bob has 36 marbles now. 

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36: 
36 - 10 = 26

"To find the temperature of the second bottle, we need to think about how the temperatures mix. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of the unknown water into his bottle, the total amount of water is 5 ounces. 

Since Donny can drink the water now, the temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's think of the unknown temperature as 'x'. When we mix the two waters, the total 'heat' is the sum of the heat from the two waters. 

The heat from the 4 ounces of 33-degree water is 4 x 33 = 132. 
The heat from the 1 ounce of 'x' degree water is 1 x x = x.

The total heat is 132 + x. 

The total amount of water is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixed water is the total heat divided by the total amount of water. 

So, (132 + x) / 5 = 40 (since the temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees).

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 5. 
132 + x = 40 x 5
132 + x = 200

Now, we subtract 132 from both sides.
x = 200 - 132
x = 68

The final answer is: 68"
"Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. That's 50 + 20 = 70 animals.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. There are 7 days in a week. So in a week, they bring 20 * 7 = 140 cows. In 3 weeks, they bring 140 * 3 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, they bring 10 * 7 = 70 chickens. In 3 weeks, they bring 70 * 3 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the new animals to the old ones. Cows: 50 + 420 = 470. Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230. 

The total number of animals is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs of bagels and each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36.

Now, divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to find out how many days it will take her to create each type of scene and then add those days together.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes. To find out how many days it will take, we divide 45 by 5. 
45 / 5 = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes. To find out how many days it will take, we divide 36 by 6. 
36 / 6 = 6 days

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes. To find out how many days it will take, we divide 49 by 7. 
49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we add the days together. 
9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days

However, this is not the correct answer because Lauren can draw different types of scenes in the same day. We need to find the least number of days it will take her to draw all the scenes.

Let's try to find the least number of days. 
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes, 6 medium-sized scenes, and 7 small-sized scenes in a day. We can multiply the number of days by the number of scenes she can draw per day and see if we can get close to the total number of scenes.

Let's try 7 days. 
7 days * 5 large-sized scenes per day = 35 large-sized scenes (short by 10)
7 days * 6 medium-sized scenes per day = 42 medium-sized scenes (short by 6)
7 days * 7 small-sized scenes per day = 49 small-sized scenes (just right)

We are short of large-sized and medium-sized scenes. Let's try 8 days. 
8 days * 5 large-sized scenes per day = 40 large-sized scenes (short by 5)
8 days * 6 medium-sized scenes per day = 48 medium-sized scenes (short by 12)
8 days * 7 small-sized scenes per day = 56 small-sized scenes (more than we need)

We are still short of large-sized and medium-sized scenes. Let's try 9 days. 
9 days * 5 large-sized scenes per day = 45 large-sized scenes (just right)
9 days * 6 medium-sized scenes per day = 54 medium-sized scenes (more than we need)
9 days * 7 small-sized scenes per day = 63 small-sized scenes (more than we need)

We have enough large-sized scenes, but we have too many medium-sized and small-sized scenes. Let's try to use the extra days to draw only the scenes we need.

We need 45 large-sized scenes and we can draw 5 per day, so we need 9 days for large-sized scenes. 
We need 36 medium-sized scenes and we can draw 6 per day, so we need 6 days for medium-sized scenes. 
We need 49 small-sized scenes and we can draw 7 per day, so we need 7 days for small-sized scenes.

We can draw large-sized scenes for 9 days, and in the first 6 days, we can also draw medium-sized scenes. In the first 7 days, we can also draw small-sized scenes.

So, we can draw all the scenes in 9 days.

"On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk. This means he used 45% of 5 inches. To find out how much chalk he used, we need to find 45% of 5. 

45% of 5 is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. Now, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher will now use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for him to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk.

20% of 2.75 is 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount of chalk used each day (0.55 inches). 

2.75 / 0.55 = 5.

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to check if the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches after 5 days.

After 5 days, the teacher will have used 5 * 0.55 = 2.75 inches of chalk. This means he will have used up all the remaining chalk. However, we need to check if he will have to recycle the chalk before the 5th day.

Let's check how much chalk he will have left after 4 days. 

After 4 days, the teacher will have used 4 * 0.55 = 2.2 inches of chalk. He will have 2.75 - 2.2 = 0.55 inches of chalk left.

Since 0.55 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the 4th day.

So, the teacher has 4 days before he has to recycle this piece.

"There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

In total, 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity. 

There are 12 + 12 = 24 students in the class. If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to find out how many gallons of milk he returned and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

First, let's find out how many gallons of milk he returned. 2/5 of 4000 gallons is the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date. 

To find 2/5 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5. 
4000 * 2 = 8000
8000 / 5 = 1600

So, Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk.

"Let's say Colin is x years old now. 
In 7 years, Colin will be x + 7 years old. 
Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy is 5(x + 7) years old now.

In 25 years, Colin will be x + 25 years old. 
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so x + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7).

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7)
x + 25 = (5/3)(x + 7)
3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)

Now, we find out how many books Bob can buy in total. 
54 sets * 100 books = 5400 books.

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3. 
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

When he threw the apple at the tree, 5 more apples fell out. He picked them up and put all but one in his pocket. So now he has 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.

He threw the remaining one at the tree, and 6 more apples fell out. He picked them up and now he has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples in his hands.

So, in total, Newton has 5 + 6 = 11 apples.

"Let's think about this. Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so that means 20 years have passed since it came out. 

When it came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's say Jim was x years old. Then John was 2x years old.

Now, John is 28 years old. We know that 20 years have passed, so when Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was 2x years old when Digimon came out, we can say 2x = 8. To find x, we divide both sides by 2. x = 8 / 2 = 4.

So Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. Now, 20 years have passed, so Jim is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. 

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's add up the bandages they used: 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.

They ordered a total of 1 + 100 = 101 + 50 = 151 bandages.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. 

So, the total number of bandages they had is 78 (left) + 91 (used) = 169 bandages.

So, he needs 5 pounds of meat. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. To find out how much seasoning he needs, we multiply 5 by 2.

5 x 2 = 10

He needs 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"To find out how much fabric Luke needs, we need to first find the total width of the windows. There are 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. 

So, we multiply 5 (number of windows) by 35 (width of each window). 
5 x 35 = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. 
So, we multiply 175 (total width) by 2. 
175 x 2 = 350 inches

"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
16 x $0.25 = $4

For the rest of the call (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, the cost for the rest of the call is:
20 x $0.2 = $4

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call to find the total cost:

"To find out how much Karen would pay, we need to first find out the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount. 

The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. So together they cost $35 + $40 = $75. 

There's a 20% discount, so we need to find 20% of $75. 20% is the same as 20/100, so we multiply $75 by 20/100. 
$75 * 20/100 = $15. 

Now we subtract the discount from the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. 
$75 - $15 = $60.

Now we need to add the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3. 
10 * $3 = $30.

Now we add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art. 
$60 + $30 = $90.

So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72. 

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the price in January, we need to find 50% of $72 and subtract it from $72. 
50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36. 
So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

Now, we multiply his speed (50 km/hr) by the time (72 hours). 
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to find out how many candies are not pink. We know there are 54 red candies. There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies. 

Since the bag has 232 candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how much Helen paid, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 x $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of $80. 10% is the same as 10/100, so we multiply $80 by 10/100. 
$80 * 10/100 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 x $8 = $56.

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost. 
$240 + $56 = $296.

Dallas has 21 marbles now, but he dropped 4 marbles. So, before dropping the marbles, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Mazie had 52 marbles and gave some to Dallas and Darla. If Dallas got 25 marbles, then we subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla got.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"Let's think about this. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. If we say the number of cows is 'c' and the number of chickens is 'h', then we know that c + h = 20 (because there are 20 animals in total).

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, we can say that 4c + 2h = 70.

Now, we can use the first equation to express 'c' in terms of 'h'. We get c = 20 - h.

Now, we can substitute this into the second equation: 4(20 - h) + 2h = 70.

Expanding this, we get 80 - 4h + 2h = 70.

Combine like terms: 80 - 2h = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2h = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: h = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens.
