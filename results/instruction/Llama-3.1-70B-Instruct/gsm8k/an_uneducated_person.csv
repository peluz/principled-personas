"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells the 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

"So, a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. And it takes half that much white fiber, so that's 2 divided by 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber. 

So, to make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. That's 2 + 1, which is 3.

"Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total amount he spent is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value of the house is 100% (the original value) + 150% (the increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value of the house was $80,000. So, 250% of $80,000 is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, Josh sells the house for $200,000. He spent $130,000. So, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, for one day, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters. 

He does this 3 times a week. So, for the whole week, he runs 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much feed Wendi gives her chickens in total each day. Since she has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we multiply 20 chickens by 3 cups of feed per chicken. 

20 chickens * 3 cups of feed per chicken = 60 cups of feed per day

Now, we know Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. We need to add those together.

15 cups of feed + 25 cups of feed = 40 cups of feed

Now, we subtract the feed already given from the total amount of feed needed per day.

60 cups of feed per day - 40 cups of feed = 20 cups of feed

"Let's break this down. Kylar's gonna buy 16 glasses. The first one costs 5 bucks. The second one's 60% of 5, so that's 3 bucks. Now, every other glass is gonna be 3 bucks, but every other one's 5 bucks.

So, we got 8 glasses that cost 5 bucks each, and 8 glasses that cost 3 bucks each. 

8 glasses at 5 bucks each is 8 x 5 = 40 bucks. 
8 glasses at 3 bucks each is 8 x 3 = 24 bucks.

Now, add 'em together: 40 + 24 = 64 bucks.

"Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. 

Now, let's add 'em all up. Seattle has 20, Charleston has 80, and Toulouse has 160. That's 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

"Let's break this down. Carla can download 2 GB per minute. She downloads 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. So she downloads 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, that's 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

Then Windows restarts and she has to start over. Now she has to download the whole 200 GB at 2 GB per minute. That's 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 

So in total, Carla downloads for 40 minutes, then waits 20 minutes for the restart, then downloads for 100 minutes. That's 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he's 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.

Then he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Now he has 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours left to drive. He drives at 80 mph, so he covers 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

In total, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles in the 4 hours. 

Since he was 180 miles away from home, he's now 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.

"Eliza gets $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. So for 40 hours, she gets 40 * $10 = $400. 

For the 5 hours she worked extra, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So for 5 hours of overtime, she gets 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding both, her total earnings for this week is $400 + $60 = $460.

"Let's break it down. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Then in the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%. To find 30% of 180, I'll multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So the downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

First, we gotta find out how much the donuts cost. 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now we add all of 'em up. $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"Let's break this down. Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree. Then each year, he gets 7 lemons and sells them for $1.5 each. That's 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year. But he also spends $3 per year on water and food for the tree. So, he makes $10.5 and spends $3, that's $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, he needs to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. If he makes $7.5 per year, we need to divide $90 by $7.5 to find out how many years it takes. $90 / $7.5 = 12.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to make back the money he spent on the tree, but that's not when he starts earning money. He starts earning money after he makes back the $90, so it's the year after that.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we call the number of vacuum cleaners she started with 'x', then she sold x/3 at the green house. 

She had x - x/3 left after the green house. That's the same as 2x/3.

Then she sold 2 more at the red house. So she had 2x/3 - 2 left.

Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So she had (2x/3 - 2)/2 left. That's the same as x/3 - 1.

We know she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6.

Then we multiply both sides by 3: x = 18.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, we divide 12 by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100.

"I think I can figure this out. 

If the merchant buys the jewelry for $5,000 and the market goes up 2.5%, that means the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000). To find 2.5% of $5,000, I'll multiply $5,000 by 0.025. That's $125. So the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

If the merchant buys the electronic gadgets for $8,000 and the market goes up 1.2%, that means the gadgets will be worth $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000). To find 1.2% of $8,000, I'll multiply $8,000 by 0.012. That's $96. So the gadgets will be worth $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Now, let's see which one gives the most profit. The profit from the jewelry is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125. The profit from the gadgets is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96. The jewelry gives more profit.

"To figure this out, let's first find out how much distance Marissa has left to walk. The trail is 12 miles long, and she's already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So she's got 12 - 6 = 6 miles left.

Now, Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. She's already walked for 2 hours. If she wants to keep her average speed at 4 miles per hour, she needs to finish the whole 12 miles in 12 / 4 = 3 hours. But she's already used up 2 hours, so she's got 3 - 2 = 1 hour left.

Since she's got 6 miles left and 1 hour to do it in, she needs to walk 6 miles per hour.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we need to find two-thirds of 10. I think that's like 10 divided by 3 and then times 2. So, 10 divided by 3 is 3.33, and 3.33 times 2 is 6.67 liters of water.

Now, we need to find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we need to find three-fifths of 15. I think that's like 15 divided by 5 and then times 3. So, 15 divided by 5 is 3, and 3 times 3 is 9 liters of water.

Now, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total. But we don't know how much water was in that 1 liter. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we can find two-thirds of 1. That's like 1 divided by 3 and then times 2, which is 0.67 liters of water.

Now, we add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then subtract the water we spilled. So, 6.67 + 9 - 0.67 is 15 liters of water.

But we need to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 15 liters of water, and the total is 24 liters, we can just say that's the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.

To find 75% of x, we multiply x by 0.75. So, we can write an equation: 0.75x = 19.50.

Now, to find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Now, divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

So Darrell's age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

Allen's age 10 years from now will be 99 + 10 = 109.

He had $5 left, so that means he spent $195 - $5 = $190 on video games. 

But we already know he spent $160 on video games, so that means he must have spent the rest of the money on something else, or he didn't sell all his lego sets. 

Since we know he had $5 left, and he spent $160 on video games, that means he made $165 from selling lego sets. 

If he made $165 from selling lego sets, and each lego set is $15, then he sold 165 / 15 = 11 lego sets.

So, in total, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours a week.

We know John runs 60 miles a week. To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the miles by the hours.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. So, the distance she runs is 6 * 2 = 12 miles, and the distance she walks is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 1764 by 12, that's 147 dozen eggs per week. He sells them for $2 per dozen, so we multiply 147 by 2, that's 294.

"Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 to 4 PM, so that's 3 hours. Distance = speed * time, so distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now, he's traveling back at 6 miles per hour. Time = distance / speed, so time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag. He's gonna remove 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books weigh 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. That's not enough, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. To remove 7.5 pounds, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.

"Let's break it down. 

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires for $60 each, so that's 6 x $60 = $360. He also fixed 4 car tires for $40 each, so that's 4 x $40 = $160. So on Thursday, he made $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires for $40 each, so that's 12 x $40 = $480. He didn't fix any truck tires, so that's it.

Now, let's compare the two days. On Thursday, he made $520, and on Friday, he made $480. Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

The difference is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much weight the bridge can still hold after the truck and driver are on it. The bridge can hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds. So, we subtract 3755 from 5000 to get the weight the bridge can still hold: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Now, we need to know how many boxes can fit in 1245 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide 1245 by 15 to get the number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83.

The answer is: 83"
"First, we gotta figure out the 25% fee. 25% of 40 is like, a quarter of 40. That's 10. So the 25% fee is 10 dollars. 

Now we add that to the original 40, that's 40 + 10 = 50. Then we add the 3 dollar delivery fee, that's 50 + 3 = 53. And finally, we add the 4 dollar tip, that's 53 + 4 = 57.

Final price: 57"

For the other 6 months, the price went down by 10%. 10% of 140 is 14 dollars. So the new price is 140 - 14 = 126 dollars a month.

So, miles per gallon is 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now, we know her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. So, to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we multiply miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.

Miles per gallon * gallons in tank = miles per tank
25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, her salary after the first year will be $600 + $60 = $660. 

The next year, she gets another 10% raise, but this time it's 10% of $660, not $600. 10% of $660 is 0.1 * 660 = $66.

The next year, she gets another 10% raise, but this time it's 10% of $726. 10% of $726 is 0.1 * 726 = $72.60.

Now we add the two amounts together: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2, since there are 2 people: 90 / 2 = 45.

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, in 64 seconds, she rows 4 times as far as she does in 16 seconds. 4 times 20 feet is 80 feet.

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, for 80 feet, we need to divide 80 by 10 to get 8. Then, we multiply 8 by 2 liters to get the total amount of water.

8 * 2 = 16

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. It can hold 6 times more than Brittany's phone. So, if we divide 1800 by 6, we get the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. It's also given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

So, if we divide 300 by 50, we get the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photograph.

300 / 50 = 6

"Sasha bought 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so that's 10 x $10 = $100. She also bought 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so that's 5 x $16 = $80. So she spent $100 + $80 = $180 total.

Prices went up 50%, so the new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + 50% of $10. 50% of $10 is $5, so the new price is $10 + $5 = $15. The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + 50% of $16. 50% of $16 is $8, so the new price is $16 + $8 = $24.

If she sells the 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $15 each, she'll get 10 x $15 = $150. If she sells the 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $24 each, she'll get 5 x $24 = $120. So she'll get $150 + $120 = $270 total.

Her profit is the amount she gets minus the amount she spent, so $270 - $180 = $90.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we need to find 40% of $40000. To do that, we multiply $40000 by 0.4, which is $16000. Now, we add this to his original salary: $40000 + $16000 = $56000. So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56000.

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's call Lylah's salary 'x'. Then, Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since it's 30% higher). We know Adrien's salary was $40000, so 1.3x = $40000. To find 'x', we divide both sides by 1.3: x = $40000 / 1.3 = $30769 (approximately).

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we'll assume the same 40% increase. We find 40% of $30769 by multiplying it by 0.4, which is $12308. Now, we add this to her original salary: $30769 + $12308 = $43077.

Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later: $56000 + $43077 = $99077.

For the rest of the week, that's Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. There are 4 days left in the week, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, if the hospital sees 500 people a day, and the doctors see 2.5 people per hour, that's 500 / 2.5 = 200 hours of doctor time per day.

The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, so the hospital pays them 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the patients pay the hospital 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000 per day.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of the number of queens, babies, and worker bees is 700. That means x + 2x + 4x = 700.

Combine like terms: 7x = 700.

Since Steve gets home in 36 minutes and Tim gets home in 40 minutes, Steve wins. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract the time it takes Steve to get home from the time it takes Tim to get home: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

The price starts at $20. After 2 months, it's $20 + $4 = $24. After 4 months, it's $24 + $4 = $28. But that's not right, 'cause the price goes up by 20% of the original price, not the new price. So after 2 months, it's $20 + $4 = $24, and after 4 months, it's $24 + $4 = $28, but that $4 is 20% of $20, so the next $4 is still 20% of $20, not $24.

So, after 2 months, it's $20 + $4 = $24. After 4 months, it's $24 + $4 = $28. After 6 months, it's $28 + $4 = $32. But that's still not right, 'cause I'm adding $4 each time, but I should be adding 20% of $20 each time, which is $4.

Let me try again. After 2 months, it's $20 + $4 = $24. After 4 months, it's $24 + $4 = $28. After 6 months, it's $28 + $4 = $32. After 8 months, it's $32 + $4 = $36. After 10 months, it's $36 + $4 = $40. After 12 months, it's $40 + $4 = $44. After 14 months, it's $44 + $4 = $48. After 16 months, it's $48 + $4 = $52. After 18 months, it's $52 + $4 = $56. After 20 months, it's $56 + $4 = $60. After 22 months, it's $60 + $4 = $64. After 24 months, it's $64 + $4 = $68. After 26 months, it's $68 + $4 = $72. After 28 months, it's $72 + $4 = $76. After 30 months, it's $76 + $4 = $80. After 32 months, it's $80 + $4 = $84. After 34 months, it's $84 + $4 = $88. After 36 months, it's $88 + $4 = $92.

One red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so they cost 5 x $4 = $20.

One action figure costs $5. There are 3 action figures, so they cost 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car. 3 action figures cost $15 and one red car costs $4, so the doll costs $15 + $4 = $19.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $19 (doll) = $54.

"Let's say Brooke's age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4.

We know that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 4 = 28.

Now, let's solve for x: 3x = 28 - 4, 3x = 24, x = 8.

So Brooke's age is 8. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can divide 90 by 6 to find the total number of rats. 90 / 6 = 15. 

Since there are 3 cages of rats and they all have the same number of rats, we can divide 15 by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage. 15 / 3 = 5.

She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns each time she mows the lawn ($4). That's $40 ÷ $4 = 10.

"Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Then he has x + 2 white chickens. 

Red chickens give 3 eggs each, so x red chickens give 3x eggs. 
White chickens give 5 eggs each, so x + 2 white chickens give 5(x + 2) eggs.

Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Now, let's solve this. 
3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

"To figure this out, I need to find the distance around the park. Since it's a rectangle, I need to add up all the sides. The park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles, so I'll add 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6. That's 15 miles.

Now, I know Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, I'll divide the total distance by his speed. That's 15 miles / 3 miles per hour.

15 / 3 = 5

"Let's break this down. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. 

Now, let's add the customers from the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers. 

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the customers from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's think this through. 

We know that both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute. So, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Now, the big pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We know that the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago minus the water lost is equal to the amount of water in each pool now. So we can set up the following equations:

x - 16 = y
2x - 16 = 4y

Now we can solve these equations. We can substitute x - 16 for y in the second equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x - 4x = -64 + 16
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. We can find the amount of water in the small pool now by subtracting the water lost:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much money Lori needs in total. The shoes cost $320 and the belt costs $32, so we add those together: $320 + $32 = $352. 

Now we know Lori needs $352. She makes $8 an hour at her job. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs ($352) by her hourly wage ($8). 

$352 ÷ $8 = 44

"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 10% of $2000 is $200. So she has to pay $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. So she will pay 12 * $165 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the amount she paid from the amount she has to pay. $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"If Harriet is 21 years old now, then Zack is 2 times Harriet's age, so Zack is 42 years old now. Adrian's age is 3 times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 63 years old now.

In 3 years, Harriet will be 24 years old, Zack will be 45 years old, and Adrian will be 66 years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3. 
24 + 45 + 66 = 135
135 / 3 = 45

"Let's break this down. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points we know: Naomi (68) + Yuri (44) + Brianna (85) = 197 points. The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points we know from the total: 251 - 197 = 54.

"Let's break this down step by step.

James started with 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water. That's a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

He lost 8 water type cards, so now he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

He bought 14 grass type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

So now he has 30 fire, 34 grass, and 32 water. That's a total of 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards. That's 32 / 96 = 0.3333.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, that's 33.

Together, Kalinda and her mom can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces they can add per minute (6). 

360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

First, Ashlyn took 30% of the 120 watermelons. To find 30% of 120, I'll multiply 120 by 0.3. That's 36 watermelons she took home.

Now, we subtract 36 from 120 to find out how many watermelons were left. That's 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find 3/4 of 84, I'll multiply 84 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's 252 / 4 = 63 watermelons she took home the second time.

Now, we subtract 63 from 84 to find out how many watermelons were left. That's 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"Let's break it down. Mark buys 12 cars for $20,000 each, so that's 12 x $20,000 = $240,000. Then he pays 10% tax on that, which is 10% of $240,000. 10% is like 10/100, so that's $240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000. Now he's got the cars for $240,000 and the tax is $24,000, so that's $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000. Then he's gotta pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so that's 12 x $1000 = $12,000.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

So, 1000 - 300 = 700 students are left.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, we subtract the students who went out through exit B from the remaining students. 700 - 420 = 280 students.

These 280 students went out through exit C.

Now, James has 6 more candies than Robert. Robert has 27 candies, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to subtract James' candies from John's candies. 54 - 33 = 21.

Dolly will read 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
Pandora will read 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

"So Mike was pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. That means he's still pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So that's 2 * 5 = 10 pages per person per week. Since there are 3 people, that's 10 * 3 = 30 pages per week.

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. So to write 30 pages, it'll take him 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing per week.

So, the total minutes he's used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes. 

To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the minutes he's used from his total minutes. 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Griffin had 24 fries, but Kyle took 5. So Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

But in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"Let's think about this. We got 4 snails in one tank and 32 snails in the other. The difference between them is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. Now, it says that difference is twice the amount of fish in both tanks. Since both tanks have the same number of fish, let's call that number 'x'. So, 2x = 28. 

Now, we gotta find 'x'. If 2x is 28, then x is half of 28. Half of 28 is 14. But that's the total number of fish in both tanks. Since both tanks have the same number of fish, we gotta divide 14 by 2. 14 divided by 2 is 7.

Now, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find 10% of $30,000, I'll multiply $30,000 by 0.1, which is $3000. So the discount is $3000. 

Now, subtract the discount from the total: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

$12 + $43 is $55. 
$55 + $15 is $70. 
$70 + $4 is $74.

But wait, termites ate 30% of the wood. So, we gotta subtract 30% of 8000 pounds. 30% is like, 30 out of 100, so we multiply 8000 by 0.3. That's 8000 x 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 1/4. To do this, we can multiply 17 by 4 (since 1/4 is the same as 4 in the denominator). So, 17 * 4 = 68.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. So in the first week, they wrote 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

Now, in the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120.

In the second week, they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

Now, we add the stories from the first and second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The flag has 76 stars, so we subtract 36 from 76, that's 76 - 36 = 40 stars left. Since the rest are 5-star rows, we divide 40 by 5, that's 40 / 5 = 8.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars. That's 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars left for the kids.

There's 8 kids, and they gotta share the 16 chocolate bars equally. So, we divide 16 by 8. That's 16 ÷ 8 = 2.

There's 5 people, so that's 0.4 kg x 5 people = 2 kg per day. 

Now, we need to figure out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do that by dividing the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount of rice they eat per day (2 kg). 

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.

Now, we need to figure out how many weeks that is. There's 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

Theo has $6000 and wants to save $2000. So he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend. He has already spent $1950, so he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left.

We know the total number of players is 105. So, we can add up the players on the offense, defense, and special teams to get 105.

That's x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams) = 105.

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Since there are 100 people in the company and 40 are junior programmers, the rest must be senior programmers. So, there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Job B pays $42,000 a year. But we gotta subtract the property tax, which is $6,000. So, that's 42000 - 6000 = $36,000. Now, we gotta figure out the income tax. The tax rate is 10%, so we gotta take 10% of $36,000. That's 0.10 * 36000 = $3,600. So, the net pay for Job B is 36000 - 3600 = $32,400.

"Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so she pays 8 x $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price goes up 50%, so the price of each share is $8 + ($8 * 0.5) = $12.

Now Maria's 8 shares are worth 8 x $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price goes down 25%, so the price of each share is $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9.

Now Maria's 8 shares are worth 8 x $9 = $72.

Final answer: $72"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate 3 times more than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 x 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs. 

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. So, 3 - 2 = 1.

"Let's say the two equal groups have x students each. Then the smallest group has x - 10 students. 

We know that the total number of students is 200. So, we can write an equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide by 3: 
x = 70

Now we know the two equal groups have 70 students each. The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Let's think about this. If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, that means if he has x cows, he has 2x chickens. Since he has 60 animals in total, we can say x + 2x = 60. That's 3x = 60. 

Now, I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I think if we divide 60 by 3, we get x. So x is 20. That means he has 20 cows and 2x, or 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. So, 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs. 

So, all together, the animals have 80 + 80 legs.

"Let's break this down. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds. The container weighs 20 pounds, so we add that too: 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

So they're making $1100 - $1000 = $100 more per day. To find the percentage, I think I need to divide that by the old amount and multiply by 100. That's ($100 / $1000) x 100 = 10%.

So far, he spent 9 + 6 = 15 hours on boating, swimming, and watching shows. This was 30% of the time he spent.

To find the total time he spent, we need to divide 15 by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%). 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, let's say she invites x friends. Each friend will also play mini-golf ($5), ride the go-karts twice ($20), and get $5 in arcade tokens. So each friend will cost $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Morgan's total budget is $90. She's already spending $30 on herself, so she has $90 - $30 = $60 left for her friends.

Since each friend costs $30, we can divide $60 by $30 to find out how many friends she can invite. $60 ÷ $30 = 2.

So Morgan can invite 2 friends.

So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so that's 300 * 3 = 900 miles per day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide 18,000 by 900.

He also needs to make 3 collie beds. Each one takes 5 pounds, so 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Then, he drives back home. The trip is 240 miles and he drives at 80 mph. We do the same thing, divide the distance by the speed. That's 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

So Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles and Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

Now, let's find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. That's 90 - 75 = 15.

"So, Tim gets Netflix for $10. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, but he saves 20% for bundling. That means he pays 80% of the price for those two. 80% of $10 is $8, so he pays $8 for each of those. 

So, he pays $10 for Netflix, and $8 for Hulu, and $8 for Disney Plus. That's $10 + $8 + $8 = $26. 

He used to pay $60 for his cable package. Now he pays $26. To find out how much he saves, we subtract $26 from $60. That's $60 - $26 = $34.

"Let's break it down. Carol spent 4 hours writing the song. Half of 4 hours is 2 hours, so she spent 2 hours recording it. Now, we need to add up the time she spent writing and recording: 4 + 2 = 6 hours. 

Now, let's convert 90 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours. 

Now, let's add up the total time she spent: 6 hours (writing and recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100. 

1.5 / 7.5 = 0.2
0.2 * 100 = 20

"Let's break this down. 

First, Nancy saw 90 spiders. Then she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 1/3rd of 90 is 30, so she saw 30 millipedes.

Now, she saw a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Twice the number of millipedes is 2 * 30 = 60. Then minus 12 is 60 - 12 = 48. So she saw 48 stink bugs.

Now, let's add them all up. 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much energy the AC uses in a day, then how much it uses in 30 days, and then subtract the new amount of energy it uses after reducing the time.

First, we need to convert watts to kilowatts. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so 900 watts is 0.9 kilowatts.

The AC uses 0.9 kilowatts per hour. If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, that's 0.9 * 8 = 7.2 kilowatts per day.

In 30 days, that's 7.2 * 30 = 216 kilowatts.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the AC by 5 hours a day, he's using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The AC uses 0.9 kilowatts per hour, so in 3 hours it uses 0.9 * 3 = 2.7 kilowatts per day.

In 30 days, that's 2.7 * 30 = 81 kilowatts.

So, the amount of energy saved is 216 - 81 = 135 kilowatts.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4. That's 5. So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7 = $35.

The cheese costs $3 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3 = $15.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese: $35 + $15 = $50.

"Let's break this down. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis at home, and he has 40 cannolis. So if he has twice as much corn, that's 2 x 40 = 80 corns.

Then Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, he already had 80 corns, and he bought 20 more, so he has 80 + 20 = 100 corns.

So, he has 100 cannolis and 100 corns. To find the combined total, we add them together: 100 + 100 = 200.

He's got 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, but it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he's got 60 - 10 = 50 minutes to read the book and get to the airport.

"Let's break this down. 

In May, they hired 40 employees. Each employee works 40 hours a week and gets paid $15 per hour. So, each employee makes $15 * 40 = $600 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, each employee makes $600 * 4 = $2400 per month. 

Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is 40 * $2400 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. That means 1/4 of 40 employees left, which is 10 employees. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees stayed. 

Each of the 30 employees still makes $2400 per month. So, the total amount paid in June is 30 * $2400 = $72000.

"Sally's parents gave her $10. She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound was $3, and the second pound was half off, so that's $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So the taffy cost $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. 

She also bought a bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. 4 * $0.25 is $1. So the magnets cost $1. 

Now, let's add up what she spent: $4.50 for taffy, $1.50 for seashells, and $1 for magnets. That's $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Now, we gotta figure out how many of those exploding candles also smell like wet dog. We know 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that might explode) have that defect. So, 5% of 500 candles is... um... 0.05 x 500 = 25 candles.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees for her sister.

Joanne gathered half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees for Joanne. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees for her sister.

Now, let's add up the apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees:
Joanne: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) = 45 apples
Sister: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

But we want to know how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Since her sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples from the average trees were gathered by Joanne.

"Let's think about this. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. We also know that there are 180 heads and 304 humps. 

If we let the number of camels be C and the number of dromedaries be D, then we know that C + D = 180 (since there are 180 heads). 

We also know that 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

Now, we can solve these two equations. If we subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get C = 124.

Now that we know C, we can find D. D = 180 - C = 180 - 124 = 56.

Then, he didn't travel at all for a day.

So, in the first week, he traveled 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers a day for 7 days. That's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wants a second hotdog. That means everyone wants 2 hotdogs, so that's 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only made 54 hotdogs. So, there's a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs one hotdog to get a second hotdog, and there's a shortage of 26 hotdogs, that means 26 guests didn't get a second hotdog, but that's not right, because some guests already had their first hotdog. Since 54 hotdogs were made, and 40 guests showed up, 40 guests got their first hotdog. So, 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs left for the second round. That means 14 guests got their second hotdog, and 40 - 14 = 26 guests got their first hotdog but not their second hotdog.

"First, we gotta figure out the width of the room. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. But we need the length in feet, 'cause that's what we're workin' with. There's 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the length is 9 feet. We can use the area to find the width. Area is length times width, so we can divide the area by the length to get the width. That's 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now we know the width is 40 feet and the length is 9 feet. The perimeter is the distance around the room, so we add up all the sides. That's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. That's 2 x 9 + 2 x 40 = 18 + 80 = 98 feet.

"Let's break this down. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 1 + 2 = 3 packs. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. That's 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

Now, each pack has 20 beads. So Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads = 60 beads. Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. That's 140 - 60 = 80.

"Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and the temperature goes up 5 degrees each hour. So that's 3 hours * 5 degrees per hour = 15 degrees. Now the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes, so the house cools down 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Now the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. That's 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes, so James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up James' time for the swim and bike ride: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes.

To find James' time for the run, we subtract 121 minutes from his total time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to figure out how far the horse ran. It ran for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta find out how many miles it ran in 30 minutes. 

32 miles per hour is like 32 miles in 60 minutes. So, for 30 minutes, it's 32 * (30/60) = 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Now, for every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30.

He spent $24 on hay, so he has $30 - $24 = $6 left.

Now, I know I saved $2, so that means if I had bought the super ticket, I would've paid $15 + $2 = $17. But the super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, so the super ticket with popcorn and soda is $20 + $1 = $21. 

But I paid $17, so the popcorn and soda must've cost $17 - $12 = $5. We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn must be $5 - $3 = $2.

First, the car went 60 mph for 2 hours. That's like 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, that's 30 * 1 = 30 miles. So the car went a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The car was driving for 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 

Now, to get the average speed, I need to divide the total miles by the total hours. That's 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we divide 320 by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs. That's 160 bags.

"Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. That's 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. 

Now, let's add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges together. 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. 

One greek orange pie needs 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3. 120 / 3 = 40.

"Let's think about this. The first venue costs $200 plus $5 per person for food. The second venue costs $25 per person, but that includes food. 

So, if we let x be the number of guests, the cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is 25x.

We want to find out when these two costs are equal. So we set them equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x.

Now, divide both sides by 20: x = 10.

"Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that together they found 43 insects, so we can write an equation:
x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
x + x + 7 = 43

Combine x terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now we know Bodhi found 18 insects. 
David found half of that, so David found 18/2 = 9 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. That's like 1/4 of 364 yards. To find that, I'll multiply 364 by 1/4. That's 364 divided by 4. That's 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. That's like 1/2 of 364 yards. To find that, I'll multiply 364 by 1/2. That's 364 divided by 2. That's 182 yards.

Now, I'll add the yards they used. 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"Let's break this down. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. We know she bought 2 packs of strawberry, 1 pack of grape for $2, and 1 pack of green apple for half of $2, which is $1. So the grape and green apple packs cost $2 + $1 = $3. 

Now, we know Suzie paid $7 in all. If the grape and green apple packs cost $3, then the 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we divide $4 by 2 to get the cost of each pack.

$4 / 2 = $2"
"To find the cheapest lumber, we need to figure out how many sticks we get per dollar. 

For 2 x 4, we get 200 sticks for $4. So, we get 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.

For 2 x 8, we get 400 sticks for $6. So, we get 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 66.67 is more than 50, the 2 x 8 is actually the better deal. But the question asks for the cheapest lumber, so we'll go with the 2 x 4.

Now, we need to figure out how many 2 x 4s Frederick can buy with $24. We can do this by dividing 24 by 4. 24 / 4 = 6.

So, Frederick can buy 6 2 x 4s. Since each 2 x 4 makes 200 sticks, we multiply 6 by 200. 6 x 200 = 1200.

Now, let's count all the animals. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so that's 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so that's 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Now, she sold $2500 - $1000 = $1500 more. For this, she gets an additional 10% commission. 10% of $1500 is 0.1 * 1500 = $150.

So, Antonella earned $300 + $150 = $450.

"Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles of water. 

He wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. So, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles of water.

He already has 48 bottles, but he needs 140. To find out how many more he needs, we subtract 48 from 140. 140 - 48 = 92.

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the question asks about a hot day, I'm gonna assume it's like the warm day. So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a hot day.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it's 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, it's 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

In the first week, Judy read 15 minutes each night. There's 7 nights in a week, so she read 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. 

Now, we know she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, to find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to figure out how many 1.5 minutes are in 105 minutes. 

There's 70 1.5 minutes in 105 minutes (105 / 1.5 = 70). Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, she read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

"Let's break this down. Peter has $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for a week. That's 7 days. So, he can spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he spent $10 each day on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. That's 4 days. So, he spent 4 x $10 = $40 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he bought $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

Now, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left. He will spend this money on plastic action figures that cost $2 each, from Thursday to Saturday. That's 3 days. Since he wants to spend the same amount each day, he will spend $30 / 3 = $10 per day on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he will buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures each day. For 3 days, he will buy 5 x 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation. 

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom. The area is length times width. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet. So the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot. So the total cost of the carpet is 216 * 12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot. So the total cost of the padding is 216 * 2 = $432.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot. So the total cost to remove the old carpet is 216 * 4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot. So the total cost to install the new carpet is 216 * 34 = $7344.

Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts. Each box has 90 contacts. So, 2 boxes will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Since each box costs $100 and is 10% off, the discount is $100 * 0.10 = $10. So, the price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

The total cost of 2 boxes is $90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we know 180 contacts will last Pete 90 days (45 days per box * 2 boxes). Since there are 180 contacts, and each pair has 2 contacts, we divide 180 by 2 to get the number of pairs, which is 90 pairs.

Now, for every 200 calories, she needs 100 ml of water. So for 1600 calories, she needs 1600 / 200 = 8 times 100 ml of water. That's 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so that's 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so that's 4 x $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up how much he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so we subtract what he spent from that: $100 - $88 = $12.

"Let's break this down. 

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups. Each cup was $0.50, so he made 60 * $0.50 = $30.

For the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour. So, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups. Each cup was $0.60, so he made 20 * $0.60 = $12.

Now, let's add the money he made in the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours. $30 + $12 = $42.

"Let's break this down. If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, that's 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile. 

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the tires rotate 362.5 * 400 = 145,000 times a month. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, the tires rotate 145,000 * 12 = 1,740,000 times a year.

Now, if each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we need to divide that by the number of rotations per year: 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6.

"If the bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps, then it gives 120 * 2 = 240 pumps. 

If the bottle costs $24.00, then we need to convert this to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $24.00 is 24 * 100 = 2400 cents.

Now, we need to find the cost of each pump. We have 240 pumps and 2400 cents. To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps: 2400 / 240 = 10.

I think that's like, 30/100 * $60 = $18. So he gets $18 off. That means he's only payin' $60 - $18 = $42. He's got $50, so he's gonna have $50 - $42 left. That's $8.

"Let's break this down. John got $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's $100,000.

Now, his research took 10 times that long, so it took 5 x 10 = 50 months total. He already had funding for the first 5 months, so he needed funding for 50 - 5 = 45 more months.

The funding for the first 5 months was $100,000, so that's $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month. The funding for the next 45 months was 50% more, so that's $20,000 x 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total funding for the next 45 months: 45 x $30,000 = $1,350,000.

Adding the initial funding, the total cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Now, we need to find out how many seats are left. Total seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so he sold them for 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire each car. 30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500. So the company paid $7,500 for each car. For 10 cars, that's 10 x $7,500 = $75,000.

The profit is what the company made from selling the cars minus what they paid for them. So the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many of them are men. We know that 60% of the riders who stay upright are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

But if he misses some classes, the cost per class will go up. Let's say he misses x classes. Then the number of classes he actually attends is 10 - x.

The cost per class is still $60, but now it's divided by the number of classes he attends, which is 10 - x. So the cost per class is $60 / (10 - x).

His parents said they won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10. So we need to find the number of classes he can miss before the cost per class is more than $10.

Let's set up an equation: $60 / (10 - x) = $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x): $60 = $10(10 - x)

Now, let's divide both sides by $10: 6 = 10 - x

Now, let's subtract 10 from both sides: -4 = -x

Now, let's multiply both sides by -1: 4 = x

So Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class is more than $10.

"Let's break it down. The plane cost $150,000. That's a one-time payment.

Now, let's calculate the monthly costs. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10,000 a month for fuel.

Total monthly cost is $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Adding the one-time payment of $150,000 to the total cost for the first year, we get $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break this down. Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

Now, beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

So, rice took 30 minutes, pork took 50 minutes, and beans took 40 minutes. To find the total time, we add these together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to find the cost of the first mixture. It's got 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 
Almonds cost $10 per pound, so 1/2 pound almonds cost 10 * 1/2 = $5. 
Walnuts cost $15 per pound, so 1/3 pound walnuts cost 15 * 1/3 = $5. 
So the first mixture costs $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, let's find the cost of the second mixture. It's got 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 
Almonds cost $10 per pound, so 1/5 pound almonds cost 10 * 1/5 = $2. 
Walnuts cost $15 per pound, so 1/3 pound walnuts cost 15 * 1/3 = $5. 
So the second mixture costs $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the difference. The first mixture costs $10 and the second mixture costs $7. 
So the difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's think about this. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. If we add up all the legs, we get 70. And if we count all the heads, we get 20. 

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. We know that S + G = 20 (total heads). 

Now, for the legs: sheep have 4 legs, so S * 4, and geese have 2 legs, so G * 2. We know that S * 4 + G * 2 = 70 (total legs).

We can use the first equation to express G in terms of S: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G in the second equation: S * 4 + (20 - S) * 2 = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide by 2: S = 15.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Kassidy has $90, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150.

Now, let's add up all their money: Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150. 120 + 90 + 150 = $360.

If they share the money equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3. 360 / 3 = $120.

We know there's one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the total number of people is 5. Let's say the ages of the other twin and the other two triplets are also T and t.

The combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. Since their combined ages are 44, we can say 2T + 3t = 44.

Now, we can substitute T = t + 7 into the equation 2T + 3t = 44. We get 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get t = 6.

"Let's break this down. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find that, we need to multiply 40% by 80%. 

First, we convert the percentages to decimals. 40% is 0.4 and 80% is 0.8. Now we multiply them: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32. So 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, we need to find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. We know the city uses 40% of the river's total water, and 32% of that is used for industrial purposes. So we subtract 32% from 40% to get the non-industrial percentage: 40% - 32% = 8%.

"Let's break this down. 

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. That's 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour. 

In 48 hours, they can make 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Now, for vanilla ice cream, they make 50 quarts in 4 hours. That's 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours, they can make 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

So, in total, they can make 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream + 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream = 3000 quarts.

"Let's break it down. 

Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3 each, so that's 5 x $3 = $15. 
He also got 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, that's 4 x $2.50 = $10. 
Then he got 3 mini quiches for $4 each, that's 3 x $4 = $12. 
And 13 blueberry muffins at $1 each, that's 13 x $1 = $13. 

Now let's add all that up: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50. 

Marcus gets 10% off, so we gotta find 10% of $50. 10% is like 10/100, so that's 0.1. 0.1 x $50 = $5. 

So Marcus gets $5 off, so his total bill is $50 - $5 = $45.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. She's left with 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces. To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract 44 from 58. 58 - 44 = 14.

So two thirds of 36 sq ft is 24 sq ft. Now, we need to find out how many tiles Mr Boarden needs for 24 sq ft. He needs 24 tiles for every sq ft, so we multiply 24 sq ft by 24 tiles.

"So the company wanted to buy 500 computers, and they thought each one would cost $700. But then they found out the price went up by 10%. That means the new price is 10% more than $700. 

To find 10% of $700, I multiply $700 by 0.1. That's $70. So the new price is $700 + $70, which is $770.

Now, I need to multiply the new price by the number of computers they wanted to buy. That's 500 computers times $770. 

500 x 700 is 350,000, and 500 x 70 is 35,000. So 500 x 770 is 350,000 + 35,000, which is 385,000.

"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. There are 2 oz of cheese, and each oz is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. There are 2 oz of ham (since it's equal to the amount of cheese), and each oz is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Finally, let's add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

"Let's break this down. When Helga's got her arms down, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. So, in one minute, she taps her right foot 300 times and her left foot 250 times. That's 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When she raises her arms, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. So, in one minute, she taps her right foot 200 times and her left foot 200 times. That's 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes, but she only raises her arms for 2 minutes. So, for 3 minutes, she taps 550 times per minute, and for 2 minutes, she taps 400 times per minute.

In 3 minutes, she taps 550 * 3 = 1650 times. In 2 minutes, she taps 400 * 2 = 800 times.

The other 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. That's 2 pizzas. 2 x 12 = 24 slices. ¾ of 24 is 18 slices eaten. So, they have 24 - 18 = 6 slices left.

Now, we need to find the average time. To do that, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, then divide by 2. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 20 minutes. 30 + 20 = 50. Divide that by 2, and we get 25.

Now, we know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe. Let's call Bobby's shoe x. Then 9 times Bobby's shoe is 9x. Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than that, so it's 9x + 10. We know that's equal to 100 inches, so we can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now we solve for x. Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90. Divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

First, let's figure out how long one playlist lasts. We got 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours, so we multiply 300 by 10. That's 3000 hours for one playlist.

"Let's break this down. We know the first house needs half of the second house. If we call the number of shingles the second house needs 'x', then the first house needs x/2.

We also know the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x.

Now, we know the total number of shingles is 250. So, we can add up the shingles for all three houses: x/2 + x + x = 250.

Combine like terms: 2.5x = 250.

Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100.

Now we know the second house needs 100 shingles. The third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half of the second house, so the first house needs 100/2 = 50 shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * 50 = 100.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, that's 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she doesn't get the extra $5. So, on Wednesday, she earns $30.

"To figure this out, we gotta think about how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the driving time. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives 75 miles per hour. So, the time it takes him to get to the museum is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. Since he drives back home too, we gotta double that time, so 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series. He can get those for $6 each, but since they're in series, let's assume he's buying the whole series at once. We don't know how many series there are, but we know he's saving $4 per movie, so we'll calculate the cost later.

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies. 40% of those are older movies, so that's 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies. Those cost $5 each.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the series movies. Since Mike is saving $4 per movie, the cost per series movie is $10 - $4 = $6. But we don't know how many series there are, so let's just multiply the number of series movies by the cost: 200 * $6 = $1200.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies. Those cost $10 each, so the cost is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now, let's add up the costs: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

They drove at 50 miles per hour, so they drove 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's figure out how fast they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

"Let's break this down. Ava and Emma get points for jumpin' on enemies, collectin' berries, and finishin' the level fast.

For enemies, Ava jumps on 8 more than Emma. Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Then Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Ava gets 10 points for each enemy, so she gets 10(x + 8) points. Emma gets 10x points.

For berries, Ava collects 3 more than Emma. Let's say Emma collects y berries. Then Ava collects y + 3 berries. Ava gets 5 points for each berry, so she gets 5(y + 3) points. Emma gets 5y points.

For the timer, Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma. Let's say Emma finishes with z seconds left. Then Ava finishes with z - 4 seconds left. Ava gets 30 points for each second left, so she gets 30(z - 4) points. Emma gets 30z points.

Now, let's add up all the points for Ava and Emma.

Ava's points: 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)
Emma's points: 10x + 5y + 30z

Now, let's find the difference between their points.

Difference = Ava's points - Emma's points
= 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
= 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30z
= 80 + 15 - 120

"Let's break this down. Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish at home. He got 17 more fish, so now he has 3 + 4 + 17 = 24 fish in total.

We know that after he added the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish is x. Then the number of orange fish is 2x.

We know that the total number of fish is 24, so the number of white fish (x) plus the number of orange fish (2x) is 24. But we also know that he already had 3 orange and 4 white fish, so we need to subtract those from the total.

So, x (new white fish) + 4 (old white fish) + 2x (new orange fish) + 3 (old orange fish) = 24.

Combine like terms: 3x + 7 = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide by 3: x = 17/3 is not a whole number, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to try a different approach.

Let's try to find the number of white fish Bob bought. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish. So, 3 (old orange fish) + (17 - x) (new orange fish) = 2 * (4 (old white fish) + x (new white fish)).

Expand the equation: 3 + 17 - x = 2 * (4 + x).

Expand the right side: 3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x.

Combine like terms: 20 - x = 8 + 2x.

Add x to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3x.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3x.

Divide by 3: 4 = x.

So Bob bought 4 white fish at the store, but we also need to consider the 4 white fish he already had, and the fact that the total number of white fish is half the total number of orange fish. 

However, the question only asks for the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to figure out how many miles Andy drives each day. Since he drives to and from work, that's 2 trips, and each trip is 5 miles. So, that's 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, since he only drives Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. So, he drives 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles per week.

Now, let's figure out how much gas he uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so for 50 miles, he'll use 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons per week.

Finally, gas costs $3 per gallon, so he spends 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15 per week.

Now we subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30.

"Milo's got 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag's got 72 chips. So, he's got 72 * 2 = 144 chips. 

It takes 12 chips to make a square inch, so he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches. 

He wants it to be 3 inches tall, so if we divide the total square inches by the height, we get the length. That's 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"Let's break this down. We know that 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. And 16 students drank 2 quarts each, that's 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. So, in total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, we know there are 10 quarts left, so to find out how much tea was there at the beginning, we need to add the quarts they drank to the quarts left. That's 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Now, I think I remember that there are 4 quarts in a gallon, so to find out how many gallons, we need to divide the total quarts by 4. That's 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"Dale started off with 100 candies. He sold 150, but he didn't have that many, so he must have taken orders for 50 more than he had. Then he got 100 more candies. So now he has 100 (the new ones) + 50 (the extra orders) = 150 candies. He already sold 150, so he needs to sell the 100 he just got."

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students. 
- At the end of January, the number doubles, so it's 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number doubles again, so it's 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number doubles again, so it's 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number doubles again, so it's 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number doubles again, so it's 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

First, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each. That's 3 x 5 = 15 petals. 

Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each. That's 4 x 6 = 24 petals. 

Next, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each. That's 5 x 4 = 20 petals.

Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each. That's 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add all the petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But then she dropped 1 of each kind of flower. So she dropped 1 with 5 petals, 1 with 6 petals, 1 with 4 petals, and 1 with 7 petals. That's 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

Now, let's subtract the petals she dropped from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

"Let's break this down. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His 2 friends who are worse can play for half as long, so that's 10 minutes per quarter. His friend who's better can play for 1.5 times as long, so that's 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 

Jack plays for 240 minutes, so that's 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

The 2 friends who are worse play for 240 minutes, so that's 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are 2 of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who's better plays for 240 minutes, so that's 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total amount of money used is 68 * 25 cents = 1700 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 1700 / 100 = 17 dollars.

She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so let's call that y. 
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so that's 2y. 
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.

Now we know that x + x + y + y + 2y = 10 (since the total is 10 ounces). 
Combine like terms: 2x + 4y = 10. 
But we know y = 2x, so we can substitute that in: 2x + 4(2x) = 10. 
That's 2x + 8x = 10, or 10x = 10. 
So x = 1. 
Now we know y = 2x, so y = 2.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So Joe sold 8 cars.

Now Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"Let's break this down. The charity raised $175,000 in total. But $50,000 came from organizations, so that means the students raised the rest. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract $50,000 from $175,000.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now we know the students raised $125,000. There are 20 students, and they all earned the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide $125,000 by 20.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Now, let's find out how many tins of dog food she bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Combine the x's: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

So PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Then, we gotta add the cost per mile. The distribution center is 20 miles away, and they charge $0.08 per mile. So that's 20 x $0.08 = $1.60. 

Now, we add those two together to get the total shipping cost. $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to figure out how much Amazon will refund. The book cost $32, but they only refund 75%. So we gotta find 75% of $32. That's $32 x 0.75 = $24.

Now, we subtract the refund from the original price to find out how much Milly's already lost. $32 - $24 = $8.

Add 9 to both sides: 6B = 96.

Divide by 6: B = 16.

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age: A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. He's got 27 students and each one needs 2 glue sticks. So, we multiply 27 by 2. That's 54 glue sticks.

Now, the glue sticks come in packs of 8. We need to figure out how many packs of 8 are in 54. We can do this by dividing 54 by 8. That's 6.75. But we can't buy 0.75 of a pack, so we need to round up to the next whole number.

So, Mr. Jackson needs 7 packs of glue sticks.

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. So Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 books.

We know that together they have 85 books. So we can write an equation: x + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85.

Now let's simplify this equation: x + x - 12 + x - 12 + 25 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3x + 1 = 85.

Now subtract 1 from both sides: 3x = 84.

Now divide by 3: x = 28.

So Fawn has 28 books."

40% is the same as 40/100, so we multiply $400 by 40/100. That's $400 * 0.4 = $160. So Keenan pays $160 per month.

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan pays per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide $160 by 4. That's $160 / 4 = $40.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 7/13 of 26 is 14. So he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, David wants 3 bottles of soda, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. He also wants 2 bottles of water, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

"Let's think this through. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there were 20 red balloons. So, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

Now, we know he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, and 40 of those were at the red balloons. So, the number of pieces of bologna he threw at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find out how many yellow balloons there were, we need to divide the number of pieces of bologna he threw at the yellow balloons by 3. So, 18 / 3 = 6.

"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so that's 100 * 30 = 3000 miles. 

Now, his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we gotta divide 3000 miles by 1000 miles. That's 3000 / 1000 = 3.

"Let's break it down. 

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add all the hours together: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

"Let's break this down. They bought a cake for $11. They bought 1 dozen balloons, that's 12 balloons. The balloons were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, so 12 balloons would be 6 times $0.5, that's $3. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 times $7, that's $14. 

Now, let's add up the money they spent: $11 for the cake, $3 for the balloons, and $14 for the ice cream. That's $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. 

Since they combined their allowance, they must have had $28 together. If they got the same amount, then we need to divide $28 by 2. $28 divided by 2 is $14.

"Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's 3 + 5 + 6, which is 14. Lola ate 2, so we gotta subtract 2 from 14. That's 14 - 2, which is 12.

"Let's break it down. There are 6 students playing tennis. Twice that number playing volleyball is 6 x 2 = 12. So there are 12 students playing volleyball. 

Now, let's look at soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. That's 16 + 22 = 38 students playing soccer.

Now, let's add all the students together. 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

"Let's break this down. Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there's 30 students. So, they sold 10 * 30 = 300 lollipops in total.

They sold each lollipop for $0.8, so they made 300 * $0.8 = $240.

They bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so they spent 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the money they made: $240 - $150 = $90.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. 

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's count all the pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. So each row has 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea.

"So, Anthony and his dad fill the tank with half the water from the pool. The pool has 10000 gallons, so half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, they use 500 gallons per day from the tank. After 6 days, they would have used 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

So, to find out how much water is left in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the total amount in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we'll divide the calories of a normal pastry by 3.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we know Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. We'll multiply the number of each pastry by its calories.

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Now, we add the calories of both pastries together: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average, we need to add up all the Junebugs Rita removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so that's 2 x 39 = 78 for each day. 
So, Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs. 
Thursday she removed 48 and Friday she removed 57. 
Now, let's add them all up: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

There are 5 days from Monday to Friday. 
So, the average is 300 / 5 = 60.

The bus went 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply 60 by 5. That's 300 miles.

The car went 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply 30 by 8. That's 240 miles.

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. We do that by subtracting the car's distance from the bus's distance. So, we subtract 240 from 300. That's 60.

"Let's say John's age is x. 
Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10. 
Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old. 
So, x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100
Combine like terms: 4x + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80
Divide both sides by 4: x = 20

Now we know John's age is 20, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30, and Peter's age is 20 + 30 = 50.

Now, we need to figure out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. Since there are 30 days in a month, the Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * 6 = $259200, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * 6 = $194400.

Now, there are 15 goats and they need 5 pounds each, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. There are 12 sheep and they need 7 pounds each, so that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the amount for the goats and the amount for the sheep. 75 + 84 = 159.

Then, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. 25% of 8 is 2, so she's 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up all their ages: Nani is 8, his brother is 16, and his sister is 6. 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.

"To figure this out, we gotta break it down. 

First, let's look at the synthetic gut ones. There are 3 of them, and it takes 15 minutes each. So that's 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, the polyester ones. There are 5 of them, and it takes 22 minutes each. So that's 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

Now, the hybrid ones. There are 4 of them, and it takes 18 minutes each. So that's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Now we add all those minutes together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"To figure this out, we gotta find the total length of the fence. Since it's a rectangle, we gotta add up all the sides. The long sides are 15 feet each, and the short sides are 10 feet each. So we got 2 long sides and 2 short sides.

2 long sides = 2 x 15 = 30 feet
2 short sides = 2 x 10 = 20 feet
Total length = 30 + 20 = 50 feet

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So we multiply the total length by 2.

50 feet x 2 = 100

"Let's break this down. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 4 boxes is 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now she's left with 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

That means she sold 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so that's 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold. 
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned. 
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390

When Emil is 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old then. 

Now, we need to figure out how old his brother is now. Since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

Now, let's add up all the pounds: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. To find 25% of 24, I'll multiply 24 by 0.25. That's 6. So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we need to add the football players and the cheerleaders/band members to find out how many students are leaving early. 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12.

Now, let's convert the length of the flower bed to the number of plants it can fit. The flower bed is 111 feet long. We'll divide that by 2.5 feet per plant. 

111 / 2.5 = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants. But Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so we multiply the number of flowers she needs to buy by the cost per flower.

Now, I need to figure out how much they cost. Petunias are $3 each, so 15 petunias will be 15 x $3 = $45. Sweet potato vines are $2.50 each, so 10 vines will be 10 x $2.50 = $25.

So in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After it was turned off, the room warmed up 2 degrees an hour for 2 hours. That's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before that. So we need to subtract 75 from 90 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

The total size of all slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is the size of their slice divided by the total size of all slices, multiplied by 100.

Now, let's add up all the time: 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, and it takes 3 hours to make, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

It costs $25 per session to rent the studio, so that's 12 days * $25/day = $300.

It also costs $1.50 per student per session. There are 10 students, so that's 10 students * $1.50/student = $15 per session. Since there are 12 sessions in a month, that's $15/session * 12 sessions = $180.

So the total cost is $300 + $180 = $480.

But wait, that's the cost, not the earnings. I'm not sure how much the dance studio charges per student, so I'll just assume they charge more than $1.50 per student. Let's say they charge $10 per student per session. That's 10 students * $10/student = $100 per session. Since there are 12 sessions in a month, that's $100/session * 12 sessions = $1200.

In total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its capacity.

Since the charge remaining was 28%, that means 100% - 28% = 72% is the total capacity that was lost and used. However, we calculated that 66% was lost. This means that 72% - 66% = 6% was used to charge the phones.

"Let's break this down. Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so that's $10 + $15 = $25 an hour. She works 40 hours a week, so that's $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Now, she wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car. 20% of $10000 is 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.

So, she needs to save $2000. She makes $1000 a week, so to find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide $2000 by $1000. That's $2000 / $1000 = 2.

"Let's see, Jamaar already bought some stuff. He got 3 peaches for 3 x $.5 = $1.5, 4 pears for 4 x $.5 = $2, 2 kiwis for 2 x $1 = $2, and 5 apples for 5 x $.75 = $3.75. That's a total of $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25. He had $10, so he's got $10 - $9.25 = $.75 left.

Now, plums are $.25 each. If he's got $.75 left, he can buy $.75 / $.25 = 3 plums.

"Anne had 15 packs of sweets, and she kept 2 for herself. So she gave 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Each pack has 60 pieces of sweets. So 13 packs have 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

She gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many each friend got, we divide 780 by 10. 780 / 10 = 78.

"To figure this out, I'll just do the math step by step.

Year 1: The price of carrots goes up by 5% of $120. 5% of $120 is 0.05 * $120 = $6. So the new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: The price of carrots goes up by 5% of $126. 5% of $126 is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. So the new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: The price of carrots goes up by 5% of $132.30. 5% of $132.30 is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. So the new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"So Olivia put the same number of pics into 8 albums. To find out how many pics in each album, we need to divide 72 by 8. That's 9 pics in each album.

Now, 3 albums were selfies only, so that's 3 x 9 = 27 selfies.

And 2 albums were portraits, so that's 2 x 9 = 18 portraits.

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

Now, if he reads 18 pages, I gotta multiply 3.33 minutes per page by 18 pages. That's 3.33 * 18 = 60 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

The hotel started with 100 guests. Then 24 guests checked out early, so that's 100 - 24 = 76 guests left. 

15 guests checked out late, but that's not important yet, 'cause they're still there. 

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. So, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. Now we have 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

Then 7 more people checked in after dinner, so now we have 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

The hotel now has 113 guests."
"Let's see... John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picked 6 more on Thursday, so that's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas so far. On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12. Now we add 12 to the 10 bananas he already had, so that's 10 + 12 = 22.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are. There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.4. That's 24 easy questions.

Now, the rest of the questions are average and difficult. There are 60 questions in total, and 24 are easy. So, 60 - 24 = 36 questions are average and difficult. Since they are equally divided, we divide 36 by 2. That's 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. To find 75% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.75. That's 18 easy questions she's sure to get.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions. Half of 18 is 9. So, she's sure to get 9 average questions and 9 difficult questions.

Now, let's add up all the questions she's sure to get. 18 easy questions + 9 average questions + 9 difficult questions = 36 questions.

"Let's break this down. If a small stuffed animal costs $4, then a large one costs 3 times that, which is $12. 

Now, let's say she sold x small stuffed animals. Then she sold x/2 large stuffed animals, since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

She earned $120 from the sales. So, the money from the small stuffed animals is $4 times x, and the money from the large stuffed animals is $12 times x/2.

We can write this as an equation: 4x + 12(x/2) = 120.

Now, let's solve for x. First, we can simplify the equation: 4x + 6x = 120.

Combine like terms: 10x = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 10: x = 12.

So, she sold 12 small stuffed animals.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, so that's 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, so that's 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

There are 30 days in a month, so that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds per month.

Now, if the third package has 8 sandwiches, and the price per sandwich is $1.50, we can multiply the number of sandwiches by the price per sandwich. That's 8 x $1.50 = $12.

First, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.

Then, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, and she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

She also released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons and had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, she had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons. That's a total of 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, there's a 50% chance the substitute teacher comes in, and if that happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, there's a 50% chance he's off the hook right there.

Now, let's look at the other 50% - when the normal teacher comes in. There's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension, so that's 40% of the 50% (or 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2, or 20%) where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Now we're down to 30% (50% - 20%) where the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension. But even then, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. So that's 20% of the 30% (or 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06, or 6%) where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's add up all the chances where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. That means there's a 100% - 76% = 24% chance Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework.

Now, we subtract that from the total seats: 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats left. 

Now, we gotta split those seats among the graduates. There's 950 graduates. So we divide 4750 by 950. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...5.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many bottles of soda Richard will put in his driveway. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he's putting a bottle every 3 feet. So we need to divide 24 by 3 to get the number of bottles. 

24 / 3 = 8 

So there will be 8 bottles of soda. Now, we need to figure out how long it will take Richard to go from one bottle to the next. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since he's starting at the first bottle, he'll have to go to 7 more bottles. 

So we multiply 7 by 5 seconds. 

7 x 5 = 35 

It will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"So Uncle Franky got 2 boxes of apples. Each box got 40 apples. So he got 2 x 40 apples, that's 80 apples. Now he wanna put 8 apples in one pack. So we gotta divide 80 by 8. That's 10.

"Let's break this down. Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so that's 50,000 * 4 = $200,000 in loans. 

Before college, Jim made $25,000 per year. He didn't work for 4 years, so that's 25,000 * 4 = $100,000 he didn't make.

So, in total, Jim needs to make $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income tripled, so he now makes 25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it'll take Jim to make $300,000, we divide $300,000 by $75,000. That's 300,000 / 75,000 = 4.

"To figure this out, we need to find the size of the fabric Jim needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs fabric that's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. 

So, the length of the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet. The width of the fabric will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we need to find the area of the fabric. To do that, we multiply the length and the width. So, 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we multiply 80 by 2. 

80 * 2 = 160

"Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add up the letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. 

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Twice the amount he lost is 2 * $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. 

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11 in the second race, so 1.5 times that is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's add up the money he lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. He also won $11, so we subtract that from the total lost: $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

To find the average, we divide the total lost by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

The second person took 80 dollars more than the first, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.
The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person took 2 * (x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount is 1920 dollars, so we can write an equation:
x + (x + 80) + 2 * (x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

Combine like terms:

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

First, we need to find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold. We know he sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. That's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now we know how many Trekking and BMX bikes Marcel sold. To find out how many MTB bikes he sold, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes. That's 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now we know how many of each type of bike Marcel sold. We also know the price of each type of bike. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250, and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now we can calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike. For MTB bikes, he sold 105 bikes at $500 each, so that's 105 * 500 = $52,500. For BMX bikes, he sold 45 bikes at $250 each, so that's 45 * 250 = $11,250. For Trekking bikes, he sold 150 bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * 450 = $67,500.

Now we can add up how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike to find the total amount he earned. That's $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

"Let's think this through. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour, and they work for 6 hours. So, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales of hay.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour, and it also works for 6 hours. So, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

Now, let's see how many bales of hay are left in the field. The farmer made 30 bales, and the truck picked up 18 bales. So, the number of bales left is 30 - 18 = 12.

"Let's break this down. 

There are 6 periods in a day, and each period is 40 minutes. So that's 6 * 40 = 240 minutes per day. But John has 2 extra classes, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 more minutes. So in total, he has 240 + 80 = 320 minutes per day.

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week.

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. He spends 1/16 of that on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes.

But he spends that much time on both Saturday and Sunday, so that's 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the minutes: 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to divide by 60 to get the number of hours: 2860 / 60 = 47.67.

"So Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, and each floor is 24 feet high. That means he drops it from 3 x 24 = 72 feet high.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so on the first bounce, it goes 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet high.

Now, on the second bounce, it's gonna go 2/3rds of the height it went on the first bounce, which is 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet high.

"Let's break it down. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 6 by 12 to get the height in inches. 6 x 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 to 72. 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 from 74. 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 to 69. 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"Let's break this down. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. But before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the velociraptors left 270 kilograms of meat. That means they ate the same amount, 270 kilograms, because they ate half. 

So, before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 + 270 = 540 kilograms of meat left. 

But before that, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the T-Rex left 540 kilograms of meat. That means the T-Rex ate the same amount, 540 kilograms, because it ate half. 

So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 + 540 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

"To figure out how much it'll cost to paint the room, we need to know how much paint we need. 

First, we need to find the area of each wall. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each.

Now, we add up the area of all the walls. We got two 80 square feet walls and two 40 square feet walls. That's 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need. That's 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. That's 12 * 12 = $144.

"Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there were 11 sodas left. 3 of them were shaken and 8 were unshaken. 

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So now there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend is gonna pick one of the 8 sodas left. The chance of her getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. That's 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total sodas.

To find the percentage, I'll divide 2 by 8 and multiply by 100. That's 0.25 * 100 = 25.

For the second biggest slide, it's 240 feet long and people go 80 feet per minute. So, we divide 240 by 80. That's 3 minutes.

Now, if we multiply that by 5 days, that's 60 x 5 = 300 minutes.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $100,000. So, 40% of that is 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

She wants to save enough to live on that for 20 years, so she'll need $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

She's saving 20% of her paycheck, which is 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Now, let's see how many years it'll take her to save $800,000. I think I need to divide the amount she needs by the amount she's saving each year... $800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

So, she needs to hike 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 more miles. Since she has 30 days, she needs to hike 1,800 / 30 = 60 more miles per day. But she hikes twice a day, so she needs to hike 60 / 2 = 30 more miles per time.

They all work for 10 hours, so the 4 workers make 20 x 10 = 200 toys. The manufacturer needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more, so they must've made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in total.

Since the 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must've made 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours. To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide 180 by 10, which is 18.

That means 2x + 12 = 30. If we subtract 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 18. If we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 9. So Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number, we can divide 26 by 2 to get the number of eggs each of them painted. 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, let's add the new animals to the ones he already had. He had 50 cows and got 420 more, so that's 50 + 420 = 470 cows. He had 20 chickens and got 210 more, so that's 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 cows and 230 chickens. That's 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

"So Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will be 4 x $10.00 = $40.00. 

He gets a 10% discount, so I gotta figure out 10% of $40.00. 10% is like 10/100, so I'll just move the decimal point one spot to the left, that's $4.00. Now I subtract that from $40.00, so $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now I know he paid $36.00 for 4 packs of bagels. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs will have 4 x 9 = 36 bagels. 

Now I gotta find out how much each bagel costs. I'll just divide the total cost by the number of bagels. $36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"Let's break this down. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. 3 less than 6 is 6 - 3 = 3, and 1 less than 3 is 3 - 1 = 2. So it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1 scoop is made from 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes. 

Now, if Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop is 1.5 potatoes, then Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so that's 3 eggs * 30 days = 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, that's 5 eggs * 30 days = 150 eggs. So in total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Now, I think a dozen is 12 eggs, right? So we gotta divide 240 by 12 to get the number of dozens. That's 240 / 12 = 20.

"Let's think about this. There's 17 green jellybeans, and twice as many red jellybeans. Twice as many red jellybeans means 2 times 17, which is 34 red jellybeans. So we got 17 green and 34 red, that's 51 jellybeans. Now, if there's 60 jellybeans in total, and we already know 51 of 'em are green or red, then the rest must be blue. So we subtract 51 from 60, that's 9.

"So, Tim grows 5 trees. Each tree gives him 6 lemons a year. That's 5 x 6 = 30 lemons a year. A decade is 10 years. So, in 10 years, he gets 30 x 10 = 300 lemons.

"Let's break this down. The ratio of men to women is 5:9. That means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. So, the total number of people in one group is 5 + 9 = 14.

Now, we know there are 84 people on the bus. We can divide 84 by 14 to find out how many groups of 14 there are. 84 / 14 = 6.

So, there are 6 groups of 14 people. In each group, there are 9 women. So, the total number of women on the bus is 6 * 9 = 54.

Now, 20 women get off the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

"Let's break this down. Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8 each. He also sells bouquets that have 12 sunflowers in them.

If he earned $26 from sunflowers per day, that means he sold $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

If he earned $56 from bouquets per day, that means he sold $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sold 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers in bouquets per day.

So, in total, he sold 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day.

After 3 days, he sold 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

"Adam has $100. He buys rocks for $5 each. So he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

He sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his rocks. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

He sells 12 rocks for $7 each, so he makes 12 * 7 = $84.

He spent $100 to buy the rocks, but he only made $84. So he loses 100 - 84 = $16.

"To figure this out, let's break it down. 

First, Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. She needs 45 large-sized picture scenes. So, to find out how many days it'll take her to draw the large-sized scenes, we divide 45 by 5. That's 9 days.

Next, she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. She needs 36 medium-sized picture scenes. So, to find out how many days it'll take her to draw the medium-sized scenes, we divide 36 by 6. That's 6 days.

Lastly, she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs 49 small-sized picture scenes. So, to find out how many days it'll take her to draw the small-sized scenes, we divide 49 by 7. That's 7 days.

Now, we need to find out how many days it'll take her to draw all of them. Since she can't draw all of them at the same time, we need to add the days it takes her to draw each type of scene. But that's not right, 'cause she can draw one type of scene per day. So, we need to find the best way to do it.

Let's try to find the least number of days by drawing the scenes in the most efficient way. We can start by drawing the large-sized scenes for 9 days, then the medium-sized scenes for 6 days, but that's 15 days already. We still have the small-sized scenes left. We can't draw all of them in one day, so we need to add more days.

Let's try drawing the small-sized scenes first. It takes 7 days to draw the small-sized scenes. Then, we can draw the medium-sized scenes for 6 days. That's 13 days already. We still have the large-sized scenes left. It takes 9 days to draw the large-sized scenes, but we can't do that 'cause we already used 13 days. So, we need to find a way to draw the large-sized scenes in less than 9 days.

We can't draw the large-sized scenes in less than 9 days, but we can try to draw some of them while drawing the small-sized scenes or the medium-sized scenes. Let's try drawing the large-sized scenes and the small-sized scenes at the same time. We can draw 5 large-sized scenes and 7 small-sized scenes in one day, but that's not the best way. We can try drawing 5 large-sized scenes and 6 medium-sized scenes in one day, but that's not the best way either.

Let's try drawing the large-sized scenes and the small-sized scenes in a different way. We can draw 5 large-sized scenes in one day, and then draw 7 small-sized scenes in the next day. We can keep doing that until we finish all the large-sized scenes and the small-sized scenes. It takes 9 days to draw the large-sized scenes, and it takes 7 days to draw the small-sized scenes. So, it'll take us 9 + 7 = 16 days, but we can do it in less than 16 days.

We can draw 5 large-sized scenes in one day, and then draw 7 small-sized scenes in the next day. We can keep doing that until we finish 4 large-sized scenes per day for 5 days, and 7 small-sized scenes per day for 5 days, and then draw the remaining large-sized scenes and the remaining small-sized scenes. We can draw 4 large-sized scenes per day for 5 days, that's 20 large-sized scenes. We still have 25 large-sized scenes left.

Now, we have the large-sized scenes and the small-sized scenes done in 10 days. We still have the medium-sized scenes left. It takes 6 days to draw the medium-sized scenes. So, we can add 6 days to the 10 days we already used. That's 16 days.

But we can do it in less than 16 days. We can draw the medium-sized scenes while drawing the large-sized scenes and the small-sized scenes. We can draw 5 large-sized scenes and 6 medium-sized scenes in one day, but that's not the best way.

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance and the total time. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, then he traveled 140 miles in 3 hours. So the total distance is 110 + 140 = 250 miles. 

The total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Average speed = total distance / total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected: Jim's 27 + Carlos' 22 + Carrey's 11 = 60 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. There are 3 people, so each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

He sold 2 devices on Monday for 2 x $40 = $80. He sold 4 devices on Tuesday for 4 x $40 = $160. In total, he earned $80 + $160 = $240.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, it would take 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, we would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach 11500 bottles. 

To do this, we subtract 4200 from 11500: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Now, all the blue-wearers wear bows, so that's 2 babies. And 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, so that's 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies in purple with bows.

So, there are 2 + 2 = 4 babies wearing bows. Out of those, 2 are wearing purple. 

To find the percentage, we need to divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies with bows and multiply by 100. That's (2 / 4) * 100 = 50.

"Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.

Then he sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold this for $3 per square meter, so that's 20 * 3 = $60.

Adding all the money he made, we get $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

There were 36 eggs hidden, and they found 27, so the number of eggs still hidden is 36 - 27 = 9.

"Let's break this down. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it's 400 + (400 * 0.6) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so that's 3 collections per week per apartment. He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment. 

So, for the first two apartment complexes, he collects 3 * 200 * 0.40 = 240 dollars per week from each complex. That's 240 * 2 = 480 dollars per week from the first two complexes.

For the last apartment complex, he collects 3 * 640 * 0.40 = 768 dollars per week.

Now, let's add it all up. 480 + 768 = 1248 dollars per week.

A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We don't know how many a 10-year-old tree produces yet, so let's call that x. Then an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Now we know x is 1000.
So an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now let's add up all the fruits:
Year 5: 50
Year 6: 150
Year 7: 350
Year 8: 800
Year 9: 0 (no fruits)
Year 10: 1000
And the first 4 years, we don't know how many fruits the tree produces, but it's probably not much, so let's just say 0 for now.

50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

But we still need to add the fruits from the first 4 years. Let's assume the tree produces 0 fruits in the first 4 years, which is probably not true, but we don't have any other information.

So the total number of fruits is 2350.

"Let's say the yellow rope is y. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's y - 7. The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4(y - 7).

We know the total length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write an equation: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: y = 12.

Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, so it's 12 - 7 = 5. The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * 5 = 20.

They both gave some money to their sister, and Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, Rissa gave 1/5 of her money to their sister. 1/5 of $15 is $3, so Rissa gave $3 to their sister.

Since they both gave the same amount of money to their sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister. Ronnie had $5, so now he has $5 - $3 = $2.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

On Thursday, she sees double Wednesday's amount, so that's 2 x 12 = 24. On Friday, she sees double Thursday's amount, so that's 2 x 24 = 48.

If the new box costs the same, $12, and I use 1 pod per cycle, I can run 120 cycles with the new box. Now, to find out how many cycles I can run for $1, I need to divide 120 by 12.

"Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we need to divide 1000 by 20. That's 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

20 bills times 20 dollars is 400 dollars. He triples his money, so he now has 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide 1200 by 5. That's 240.

"Let's break this down. 

In the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals. 

Now, team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now let's add up all the goals. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals, so that's 4 + 2 = 6 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals, so that's 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

"Let's break this down. 

The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, so that's 45% of 5 inches. To find 45% of 5 inches, I'll multiply 5 by 0.45. That's 2.25 inches used on Monday.

Now, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. To find 20% of 2.75 inches, I'll multiply 2.75 by 0.2. That's 0.55 inches per day.

Now, I'll divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used per day (0.55 inches). That's 2.75 / 0.55 = 5 days.

But wait, the teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. After 5 days, the teacher will have 2.75 - (5 * 0.55) = 0 inches left, but that's not right. I made a mistake. 

Let me try again. After 4 days, the teacher will have 2.75 - (4 * 0.55) = 0.55 inches left. After 5 days, the teacher will have 0.55 - 0.55 = 0 inches left. But the teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk, so he will recycle the chalk on the 5th day.

However, the teacher will still have 0.55 inches left after 4 days, which is more than 0.2 inches, but less than 2 inches is not the problem, the problem is that he can't write with a very small piece of chalk, but 0.55 inches is not very small, it is small, but he can still write with it, so he will write with it on the 5th day and then he will have to recycle the chalk.

So the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 5th day, but he will use the chalk on the 5th day, so the answer is 5.

Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If Colin is x years old now, then seven years from now, he'll be x + 7 years old. Wendy is five times that, so Wendy is 5(x + 7) years old now.

In 25 years, Colin will be x + 25 years old. It says that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, x + 25 is a third of Wendy's age now. We already know Wendy's age now is 5(x + 7). 

So, x + 25 = (1/3) * 5(x + 7). 

Now, let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7). 

Expanding both sides: 3x + 75 = 5x + 35.

Now, subtract 3x from both sides: 75 = 2x + 35.

Subtract 35 from both sides: 40 = 2x.

Divide both sides by 2: 20 = x.

Now, we need to know how many slices are in a pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 

For the cheese pizza, Kate's friends will eat 6 slices * 6 friends = 36 slices. Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, Kate's friends will eat 4 slices * 6 friends = 24 slices. Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Let's work backwards. On the third day, they had 78 bandages left, and they used 25 bandages, so they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages before they used any on the third day. They got 100 bandages on the third day, so they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages left from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, and they had 3 bandages left from the first two days, so they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the end of the first day.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, I'll multiply 420 by 0.6. That's 420 * 0.6 = 252 shells.

Now, team Alphas found 280 shells, and team The finders found 252 shells. So, the total shells found by these two teams are 280 + 252 = 532 shells.

The total shells were 700, and team Alphas and team The finders found 532 shells. So, team Gogetters found 700 - 532 = 168 shells.

"To figure this out, we need to know the total miles all the dogs need to walk. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk 3 miles on average, we multiply 4 dogs by 3 miles. That's 4 x 3 = 12 miles.

Now, we know the first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. Let's add those up: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the total miles needed is 12 and the first three dogs need 8 miles, the last dog needs 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

"John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that. 40% of $250,000 is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.

He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

So, he had $100,000 and used $60,000 to pay off his debts. That means he had $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover.

"Deandre caught 3 tunas. The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. To find the total weight, we need to add the weights of all the tunas. 

56 + 46 = 102
102 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, we need to find out how much he will earn. A kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find the total amount, we need to multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

128 * 0.50 = 64

"So Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. That means she sells them for 11/8 * 72 dollars. 

To find 11/8 * 72, I'll first find 1/8 of 72. 72 divided by 8 is 9. Then I'll multiply 9 by 11. 9 * 11 is 99.

So she sells the magazines for 99 dollars. She bought them for 72 dollars. To find her profit, I'll subtract 72 from 99. 99 - 72 is 27.

"Let's break this down. 

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so that's 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, so it's 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it's 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add all the water removed: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month. So, in 11 months, he will pay 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we know the jelly beans take up about 80% of that space, so we multiply 540 by 0.8. That's 432 cubic inches.

Next, we know each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So we divide 432 by 0.15 to get the total number of jelly beans. That's 2880 jelly beans.

Now, we know 30% of those are red, so we multiply 2880 by 0.3. That's 864 jelly beans.

But we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. So to find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his guess from the true number. That's 900 - 864 = 36.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is 30, so 30 people entered at the second stop. Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled. So now there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract 180 from 200.

"Let's break it down. Alicia takes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to the dry cleaners each week. 

For the blouses, it's 5 blouses * $5 each, that's 5 * 5 = $25. 
For the pants, it's 2 pants * $8 each, that's 2 * 8 = $16. 
For the skirt, it's 1 skirt * $6, that's just $6.

So, in one week, she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47.

Now, if we do that for 5 weeks, it's $47 * 5 = $235.

Now, we need to figure out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people. 
On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 people.

Now, let's add the people Conor saw on the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

The rest of the week is 4 days (since there are 7 days in a week). Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"Let's break this down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

After Garrett took the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also popped from the residual heat, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

Then he turned around and drove east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 8 x 18 = 144 miles east.

Now, since he drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to subtract the distance he drove west from the distance he drove east to find out how far he is from his house. That's 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Gary bought the boat for $9000. In the first year, it depreciated 30%. To find the depreciation, I'll multiply $9000 by 0.30. That's $2700. So, the boat's value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated another 30%. I'll multiply $6300 by 0.30. That's $1890. So, the boat's value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated 20%. I'll multiply $4410 by 0.20. That's $882. So, the boat's value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost of the bus trips is 7 x $8 = $56.

"Let's break this down. James is twice as old as Dora. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. If James is twice as old as Dora, then James is 18 now. 

John was 19 when James was born, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 now. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 now. 

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8.

"Let's think about this. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she'll peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 1 hour (60 minutes), she'll peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

So, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"So Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, that's a big discount. 80% of 400 is 320, so he saves 320 dollars. That means he pays 400 - 320 = 80 dollars for the radiator.

Then he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at 50 dollars an hour. That's 3 x 50 = 150 dollars.

So he pays 80 dollars for the radiator and 150 dollars for the mechanic. That's 80 + 150 = 230 dollars.

"Let's think about this. Cows got 4 legs and chickens got 2 legs. If we say the number of cows is x, then the number of chickens is 20 - x. 

Now, we know that the total number of legs is 70. So, we can make an equation: 4x + 2(20 - x) = 70.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x + 40 - 2x = 70. 
Combine like terms: 2x + 40 = 70.

Now, subtract 40 from both sides: 2x = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 15.

So, the number of cows is 15. But we want the number of chickens, which is 20 - x = 20 - 15 = 5.

"There's Henry and 3 of his friends, that's 4 people. They got 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we gotta find out how many slices in total. That's 7 pizzas * 8 slices = 56 slices. Now, we gotta divide that by 4 people. 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.
