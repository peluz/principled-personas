"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the flutist lives in the second house. There's one house between the flutist and the pianist, so the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 4. But since the flutist is in house 2, the pianist can't be in house 1, 'cause there's no house between them. So the pianist must be in house 4.

Now, the person with the tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. The guitarist can't be in house 4, 'cause the pianist is there. And the guitarist can't be in house 2, 'cause the flutist is there. And the guitarist can't be in house 1, 'cause there's no one to the left of house 1. So the guitarist must be in house 3.

If the guitarist is in house 3, then the person with the tulips must be in house 2... no, wait, the flutist is in house 2. So the person with the tulips must be in house 1, and the guitarist is in house 3.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1."

From clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. 
From clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. 
So, the cellist can't live in the first house (because the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other, and the first house is already taken by the person who likes green). 
Also, the cellist can't live in the third house (because there would be no house between the cellist and the person who has a gameboy). 
So, the cellist must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the second house. Clue 2 says the cricketer lives next to the person who likes red, so the cricketer lives in either the first or third house.

From clue 1, the person wearing boots lives to the right of the person who likes green. Clue 18 says the person wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house, so the person wearing boots must live in the fifth house, but that's not possible because the person eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. 

So, the person wearing boots must live in the third or fourth house. But the person wearing boots can't live in the fourth house because the person wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 10, the person wearing loafers and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Clue 6 says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person eating a banana.

So, the order is: baseball player, person eating oranges, person wearing sandals, person eating banana. 

From clue 10, the person wearing loafers lives next to the person wearing sandals, so the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person eating oranges or to the left of the person eating banana. But the person wearing loafers can't live to the right of the person eating banana because the person wearing boots lives to the right of the person who likes green, and the person wearing boots lives in the third house. 

So, the person wearing loafers lives to the left of the person eating banana, but that's not possible because the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person eating banana. 

So, the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person eating oranges. 

The order is: baseball player, person eating oranges, person wearing loafers, person wearing sandals, person eating banana. 

But the person wearing boots lives in the third house, so the order is: baseball player, person eating oranges, person wearing boots, person wearing sandals, person eating banana.

From clue 12, the person eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, so the person eating mangos lives in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the tea drinker. From clue 6, the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house, the person who drives a truck must be in the second house, but that's not possible since the person eating mangos is in the second house. So the person who drives a truck must be in the first house, and the tea drinker must be to the left of the person who drives a truck, but that's not possible since there's no house to the left of the first house. So the person who drives a truck must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the first house, but that's not possible since the person eating apples is in the first house. Wait, I made a mistake. The person eating apples is in the first house, and the person eating apples could be the tea drinker.

If the person with tulips is in the second house, then the person with a phone is in the third house. But then the history book buff would have to be in the third house too, which doesn't fit with clue 5. 

So, the person with tulips must be in the second house, and the person with a phone is in the first or third house. But we know the violinist is in the first house, so the person with a phone is in the third house.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. That means the history book buff can't live in house 1, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So the history book buff lives in house 2.

Now, the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, so that means the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1.

2. Swimmer (don't know what book they like yet)
3. Romance book lover (don't know what sport they play yet)
4. ? (don't know what book they like or what sport they play yet)

The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. They can't be in the first and second houses because the golfer and swimmer are already there. They can't be in the third and fourth houses because the romance book lover is in the third house, and there's no one to the left of the fourth house. So the mystery book reader and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses. But the romance book lover is in the third house, so the mystery book reader and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. Wait, the swimmer is in the second house.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. We also know the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, and the person who likes green lives left of the person with the radio, the person who likes green must live in the first house. 

Now, we know the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. So, the person who likes green and the fantasy book enthusiast are the same person.

"That's a lot to take in. Let me think for a sec. Alright, so from clue 8, I know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. And from clue 13, I know the cat lover lives in the first house too. So, the person who is eating kiwis and the cat lover are the same person, and they live in house number 1.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 6, the person who had pizza lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese. 
From clue 4, the person who had stew lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. 
From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives right of the person who ate spaghetti. 
From clue 6, the person who had pizza lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese. 
So, the order is: pizza, spaghetti, grilled cheese, and stew (or stew, grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza doesn't work because of clue 7). 

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. 
From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. 
From clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese. 
So, the order is: pizza, spaghetti, rose bouquet, grilled cheese, and tulips (or tulips, grilled cheese, rose bouquet, spaghetti, pizza doesn't work because of clue 1). 
But from clue 4, the person who had stew lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. 
So, the order is: pizza, spaghetti, rose bouquet, grilled cheese, and stew (or stew, grilled cheese, rose bouquet, spaghetti, pizza doesn't work because of clue 1). 
And tulips can't be in the fifth house, so the person who had stew lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, the person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the first house. 

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house. And there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives. 

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. 

So, let's try to put this together. The cat lover lives in the first house. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house, and the dog owner must live in the third house.

Now, the person who owns horses can't live in the first house (cat lover), second house (tulips), or third house (dog owner), so the person who owns horses must live in the fourth house.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the person with the phone lives in the first house. We also know the person with boots doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house too. 

Now, the person with horses and the person with the radio live next to each other. If the person with boots (and the phone) lives in the first house, then the person with horses must live in the second house, and the person with the radio must live in the first house, but that can't be 'cause the person with the phone lives in the first house. 

So, the person with the radio must live in the second house, and the person with horses lives in the first house, but that can't be 'cause the person with the phone lives in the first house. 

Wait, I got it. The person with the phone lives in the first house, and they can't have horses 'cause the person with horses lives next to the person with the radio. So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, and they have boots. 

The person with the radio lives in the second house, and they have horses. The person with the phone has boots, so the person with the radio must have high heels. No, that can't be 'cause the person with the radio lives next to the person with horses, and the person with horses can't have high heels, that's the person who lives in the other house. 

So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, and they have boots. The person with the radio lives in the second house, and they have horses. The person with the phone has boots, so the person who lives in the second house can't have boots, they must have high heels."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. Clue 2 says the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or second house. 

Clue 9 says the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other. Clue 6 says the person who is wearing loafers doesn't live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or second house too.

Now, from clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a computer lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who is wearing loafers, and they live in either the first or second house, the person who has a phone must live in the second or third house.

Clue 5 says there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. If the person who has a phone lives in the third house, then the person who likes blue must live in the first house. If the person who has a phone lives in the second house, then the person who likes blue must live in either the first or third house, but since there's one house between them, the person who likes blue can't live in the third house. So, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Now, from clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Clue 3 says the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who has a computer, and the person who has a computer lives next to the person who is wearing loafers. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer must live in the second and third houses, but the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the third house, so they must live in the second house.

The person who is wearing boots can't live in the third house, because the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of them, and the person who is eating grapes can't live in the fourth house because there are only three houses. The person who is wearing boots can't live in the second house, because the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. 

From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the tennis player and cat lover can't be in the first and second houses. They can't be in the third and fourth houses either, 'cause then the tennis player would be to the right of the cat lover. So, the tennis player and cat lover must be in the third and fourth houses, or the second and third houses. But we know the baseball player is in the second house, so the tennis player and cat lover must be in the third and fourth houses.

From clue 2, the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 3, the person with the sedan lives left of the person with the SUV. And from clue 6, the person with the sedan lives next to the person with the gameboy. So, the person with the sedan and the person with the gameboy are in houses 1 and 2, in that order, or the other way around.

From clue 1, the person who likes white lives to the right of the person with the computer. The person with the computer can't be in house 3, 'cause then the person who likes white would have to be to the right of them, but there ain't no house to the right of house 3. So, the person with the computer is in house 1 or 2.

Now, if the person with the computer is in house 1, then the person who likes white is in house 2 or 3. But from clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white. So, if the person who likes white is in house 2, then the guitarist is in house 3. But then there's no room for the person who likes blue, 'cause from clue 2, there's one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue.

So, the person who likes white must be in house 3. And from clue 1, the person with the computer is in house 1 or 2. And from clue 6, the person with the gameboy is in house 1 or 2. So, the person with the computer and the person with the gameboy are in houses 1 and 2, in that order, or the other way around.

From clue 5, the violinist ain't in house 1. And from clue 7, the guitarist is to the right of the person who likes white, so the guitarist is in house 3, and the person who likes white is in house 3 too. So, the violinist is in house 2.

Now, from clue 4, the swimmer lives to the right of the person with the SUV. And from clue 3, the person with the sedan lives left of the person with the SUV. So, the person with the sedan is in house 1, the person with the SUV is in house 2, and the swimmer is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes white and the guitarist are in house 3. So, the swimmer must be the person who likes white, and the person who likes blue is in house 1.

From clue 2, there's one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue. So, the baseball player is in house 3, but we already know the person who likes white and the guitarist are in house 3. So, the baseball player must be in house 2, but we already know the violinist is in house 2. So, the baseball player is the violinist.

So, the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person with the gameboy is in house 1, the person with the computer is in house 2, the violinist is in house 2, and the person who likes white and the guitarist are in house 3.

The only one left is the soccer player, and the only house left is house 2, but we already know the violinist is in house 2, and the person with the computer is in house 2. So, the soccer player must be in house 1, but we already know the person who likes blue is in house 1, and the person with the gameboy is in house 1. So, the soccer player is the person who likes blue, and the person with the gameboy.

But we already know the person with the gameboy is in house 1, and the person with the sedan is in house 1. So, the soccer player is the person who likes blue, and the person with the gameboy, and the person with the sedan.

So, the soccer player lives in house 1."
"That's a lot to take in. Alright, let's see... Clue 11 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. That's pretty straightforward. So, the answer is:

(E) 1"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television. That means the person with the television can't be in house 1, 'cause there ain't nobody to the left of 'em. So, that means the person with the television is either in house 2 or 3.

Now, from clue 2, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. And from clue 5, the person who is eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots. So, we got kiwis, then oranges, then boots. 

If the person with the television is in house 2, then the person with oranges would be in house 1, but that don't work 'cause the person with kiwis gotta be to the left of the person with oranges. So, the person with the television must be in house 3.

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who likes milk. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house (clue 2), the person who is eating a banana must live in either the second or the fourth house. But the person who likes milk lives in the third house, so the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. From clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. 

From clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in either the first or the second house. But the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, so the person who likes red must live in the first house.

Since the person who likes red lives in the first house, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house (clue 10). The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow (clue 5), but the person who likes red lives in the first house, so the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. But the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, so this is not possible. The person who only drinks water must live in the third house, but the person who likes milk lives in the third house, so this is not possible either. The person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house (clue 5). From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

But the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, so this is not possible. The person who only drinks water must live in the third house, but the person who likes milk lives in the third house, so this is not possible either. The person who only drinks water must live in the second house, but the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, so this is not possible either. The person who only drinks water must live in the first house, but the person who likes red lives in the first house, so this is not possible either.

From clue 6, the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. Clue 9 says the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. 

Clue 4 says the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Clue 10 says there's one house between the person who likes green and the person who drives a truck. Clue 3 says the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. 

Now, clue 5 says the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Clue 1 says there's one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives. 

Clue 8 says the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Clue 5 says the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. So, the person who is wearing boots and the person who is wearing loafers must live to the left of the person who drives a truck. 

Now, let's try to put this together. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house, and the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fifth house, but that's where the person who likes blue lives. So, the person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house, but that's where the person who likes white lives. That can't be right. 

Let's try again. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. The person who is wearing sandals can't live in the fifth house, 'cause that's where the person who likes blue lives. The person who drives a truck can't live in the fourth house, 'cause that's where the person who likes white lives. So, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, but that's where the person who likes white lives. That can't be right. 

Let's try again. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. The person who is wearing sandals can't live in the fifth house, 'cause that's where the person who likes blue lives. The person who drives a truck can't live in the fourth house, 'cause that's where the person who likes white lives. The person who drives a truck can't live in the third house, 'cause then the person who is wearing sandals would live in the fourth house, but that's where the person who likes white lives. So, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house. 

Now, clue 5 says the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. Clue 1 says there's one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, so the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house, but that's where the person who is wearing sandals lives. That can't be right. 

Let's try again. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house. Clue 5 says the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. Clue 1 says there's one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, so the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house, but that's where the person who is wearing sandals lives. That can't be right. 

Wait a minute. Clue 8 says the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house. 

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"That's an easy one. The history book buff lives in the first house. It says so right in clue 2. So the answer is:

(B) 1"
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 8, the soccer player lives in the first house. From clue 15, the soccer player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. So, the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 14, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. From clue 20, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. So, the swimmer lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house or the fifth house. But from clue 5, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. So, the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, and the person who had stew lives in the fifth house.

From clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live directly next to each other. But the swimmer lives in the fourth house, and the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house or the fifth house. But the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house. But the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. So, the person who ate fried rice and the person who had stew are the same person.

From clue 21, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the person who had stew lives. The person who had stew lives in the fifth house. So, the pianist lives in the third house or the fourth house. But the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house. So, the pianist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the cellist and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other. From clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. The person who had stew lives in the fifth house. So, the person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house or the fourth house. But the pianist lives in the fourth house.

So, the person who is eating grapes and the person who had stew are the same person.

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house. From clue 11, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. From clue 16, the flutist does not live in the fifth house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the first house, the second house, the third house, or the fourth house. But the soccer player lives in the first house, the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, and the pianist lives in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in none of these houses. But the person who is eating apples lives in one of the five houses. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house or the fourth house. But the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

But the pianist lives in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating apples and the pianist are the same person.

From clue 7, I know the person with daffodils lives in house 2. Clue 3 says the history book buff lives in house 2, so the person with daffodils is the history book buff.

Clue 6 says the person with loafers lives in house 3. Clue 8 says the person with boots and the person who likes yellow live next to each other. Since the person with loafers is in house 3, the person with boots and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 2. But clue 2 says the person who likes yellow doesn't live in house 1, so the person with boots must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 2. But wait, we already know the person with daffodils (the history book buff) lives in house 2, so that can't be right.

Let me rethink this. Clue 8 says the person with boots and the person who likes yellow live next to each other. Clue 2 says the person who likes yellow doesn't live in house 1, and clue 4 says the person who likes yellow doesn't live in house 3. So the person who likes yellow must live in house 2. But we already know the person with daffodils (the history book buff) lives in house 2. That means the person with boots must live in house 1 or house 3. But clue 6 says the person with loafers lives in house 3, so the person with boots must live in house 1.

So the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 2, but that's where the person with daffodils lives.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 4, the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist. 

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 8, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in either house 4 or 5.

From clue 4, the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 4, and the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 7, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes milk are the same person.

From clue 1, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. From clue 5, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. 

From clue 3, the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 8, the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.

Considering all the clues, let's try to find the house number of the person who owns a sedan.

If the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. But the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who drives a convertible lives in the third house. However, the person who likes milk lives in the third house, and the person who likes milk is the same person who ate grilled cheese. This is not possible.

If the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. But the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who drives a convertible lives in the third house. However, the person who likes milk lives in the third house, and the person who likes milk is the same person who ate grilled cheese. This is not possible.

If the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. But the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house or the third house (if the person who only drinks water lives in the second house). However, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, and the person who likes milk lives in the third house. This is not possible.

If the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. But the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. This is possible.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."

From clue 3, the saxophonist lives in the second house. 
From clue 8, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist, so the person who had pizza lives in either house 3 or 4. 
From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. 
From clue 5, the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, and from clue 10, the tea drinker lives in the fourth house. 
So the cellist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 
From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. 
From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. 
From clue 9, the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house. 
From clue 10, the root beer lover lives in the third house.

Now, let's put the basketball player and the person who drives a truck together. Since the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, they can be in either house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 3. But the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, and the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the basketball player and the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. We also know the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house. 

From clue 2, the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan driver. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person eating apples must be the tea drinker. 

Now, the tea drinker is in the first house and is eating apples. 

From clue 4, there's one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. If the coffee drinker was in the first house, that would mean the fantasy book enthusiast would be in the third house, but that's not possible since the tea drinker is in the first house. 

So, the coffee drinker can't be in the first house. 

If the coffee drinker was in the third house, then the fantasy book enthusiast would be in the first house, but the tea drinker is in the first house. 

So, the coffee drinker must be in the second house."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who likes red lives in the second house (clue 4). We also know that person lives directly left of the mystery book reader (clue 1). So, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now, the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house (clue 2), and the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house (clue 3). Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

That leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in the only remaining house, which is the third house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives there. Wait, that can't be right.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. This also means the person eating a banana could live in the fourth house. But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

So, the answer is (B) 4."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 3, the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes white. 
From clue 4, the person wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who likes white. 
This means the flutist and the person wearing loafers must be the same person, and they live in house 1.

Now, from clue 1, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. 
So the person in house 1 ate spaghetti.

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house. 
So the person in house 1 owns an SUV, and the person in house 2 owns a sedan.

Now we know the person in house 1 is a flutist, ate spaghetti, owns an SUV, and wears loafers. 
The person in house 2 owns a sedan and likes white. 
The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house, so the person in house 2 ate fried rice. 
The person who is a cellist does not live in the first house, so the person in house 2 is a cellist.

The only thing left is the shoes and the favorite color of the person in house 1. 
We already know the person in house 1 wears loafers. 
The person in house 2 likes white, so the person in house 1 likes green.

Now we have all the information:
- House 1: flutist, spaghetti, SUV, loafers, green
- House 2: cellist, fried rice, sedan, ?, white

The only thing left is the shoes of the person in house 2. 
Since the person in house 1 wears loafers, the person in house 2 wears sandals.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water doesn't live in the first house (clue 3), they must live in the second house. This means the person who drives a minivan also lives in either the first or second house. But since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, but we already know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a minivan and the person who owns a sedan must be the same person.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos must live in either the second or third house. But we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, so the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house. But wait, the root beer lover lives in the third house (clue 4), so the person who is eating mangos and the root beer lover must be the same person.

From clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (clue 8), the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, who lives directly left of the violinist. This means the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, and the violinist lives in the third house. But we already know the root beer lover lives in the third house, so the violinist and the root beer lover must be the same person.

However, we also know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the second house. This means the person who only drinks water and the person who is eating apples must be the same person.

So, the person who owns a sedan and drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water and is eating apples lives in the second house, and the violinist and the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 12, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. Clue 2 says the person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person wearing boots. Clue 18 says the person wearing boots doesn't live in the third house. 

Clue 5 says the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house. Clue 19 says the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who likes white. Clue 8 says the person who had stew doesn't live in the third house. 

From clue 1, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. Clue 13 says the person who likes red doesn't live in the fifth house. Clue 17 says the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner. Clue 9 says the person who is wearing loafers lives to the right of the cat lover. Clue 7 says there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.

So, the person with the TV lives in house 1. That's clue 2. Now, the person with the lilies don't live in house 1, that's clue 1. 

If the person with the lilies don't live in house 1, they must live in house 2. And if the person with the TV lives in house 1, that means the person with the computer must live in house 2, 'cause they can't both have the same thing.

So, the person with the computer lives in house 2. That's my answer.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. That means the science fiction book fanatic can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of house 2. So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1, the history book buff must live in house 2, 'cause they can't live next to each other if they're in the same house.

Now, from clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. If the guitarist lives in house 2, then the person with daffodils must live in house 1. But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. So, the person with daffodils and the science fiction book fanatic are the same person.

Now we got this:
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, daffodils, ???
- House 2: history book buff, ???

We know the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. So, the person who had pizza must live in house 1. That means the person who had spaghetti lives in house 2.

We also know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. So, the golfer must live in house 2. That means the baseball player lives in house 1.

Now we got this:
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, daffodils, pizza, baseball player, ???
- House 2: history book buff, spaghetti, golfer, ???

The only thing left is the musical instrument. We know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. So, the guitarist must live in house 2. That means the percussionist lives in house 1.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 8, we know the violinist lives in the 4th house. 

From clue 10, we know the bird keeper lives in the 5th house.

From clue 3, we know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. 

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between the person who has a phone and the person who owns horses. Since the violinist lives in the 4th house, the person who owns horses must live in either the 1st or the 2nd house. But from clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the 2nd house. So the person who owns horses must live in the 1st house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the 2nd house.

From clue 4, we know the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. From clue 7, we know the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. So the order is: flutist, television, gameboy. 

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist. From clue 6, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist. So the order is: percussionist, guitarist, gameboy. 

From clue 5, we know the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a radio. But we already know the order of the television and the gameboy. So the order is: percussionist, guitarist, television, gameboy, radio. But we also know the order of the flutist, television, and gameboy. So the order is: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, television, gameboy.

Now we have two orders: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, television, gameboy and fish enthusiast, violinist, bird keeper. We can combine them: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, television, gameboy, violinist, bird keeper. But we know the violinist lives in the 4th house, so the order is: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, television, gameboy, violinist is not correct. The correct order is: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, television, gameboy, and the violinist lives in the 4th house. So the order is: percussionist, guitarist, flutist, violinist, television, gameboy, bird keeper.

Now we have the order of the people and their devices, but we still don't know the order of the people and their pets. But we can figure out the house number of the percussionist. The percussionist lives in the 1st house.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the person with lilies lives in the first house (clue 3). We also know the basketball player doesn't live in the first house (clue 4), so the person in the first house must be the swimmer.

Now, the person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist (clue 2). If the violinist lived in the second house, then the person with the radio would have to live to the right of the second house, but there's no house to the right of the second house. So, the violinist must live in the first house.

But then the person who ate stew and the person who ate spaghetti can't live next to each other. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

Now, the person who had pizza lives in the first house. The person who ate stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate stew lives in the third house, but the tennis player lives in the third house. This means the person who ate stew can't live in the third house.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk, and the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, and the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the swimmer lives in the fourth house. From clue 13, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. From clue 17, the person who is wearing boots lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.

House 1: running shoes (clue 13)
House 3: boots (clue 17)
House 4: swimmer (clue 7)

The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement (clue 6) and directly left of the person who owns horses (clue 9). The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 1). 

The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet (clue 16) and somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio (clue 10). The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player (clue 5). 

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (clue 8).

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (clue 8). The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (clue 13). 

Considering all the clues, I think the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1 is not possible because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (clue 13).

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. We also know the person eating apples lives next to the tennis player. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, the person eating apples must live in the second house. 

Now, the tennis player lives next to the person eating apples, so the tennis player must live in the first house. 

The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house, and the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the person eating kiwis must be the mystery book reader.

The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. The dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house. This means the bird keeper lives in the first house.

Now, we have the bird keeper and the tennis player in the first house, but we can't have two people in one house. So, the bird keeper must be the tennis player.

The person wearing high heels lives next to the bird keeper, so the person wearing high heels must live in the second house. The person eating apples lives in the second house, so the person eating apples must be wearing high heels.

The person eating kiwis lives in the first house and is the mystery book reader. The person eating kiwis is also the cricketer, because the other person is the tennis player.

So, the cricketer lives in house number 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 9, the person eating oranges lives in the 2nd house. Clue 8 says the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating mangos must live in the 1st house.

Clue 10 says the fish enthusiast lives in the 3rd house. Clue 2 says the cat lover lives to the left of the fish enthusiast. So, the cat lover lives in the 2nd house, but we already know the person eating oranges lives in the 2nd house. This means the cat lover is eating oranges.

Clue 12 says the swimmer lives in the 2nd house, but we already know the person eating oranges lives in the 2nd house. This means the swimmer is eating oranges.

Clue 7 says the cricketer lives to the right of the swimmer. Clue 5 says the cricketer lives to the left of the tennis player. So, the order is swimmer, cricketer, tennis player. We know the swimmer lives in the 2nd house, so the cricketer lives in the 3rd house, but we already know the fish enthusiast lives in the 3rd house. This means the cricketer is the fish enthusiast.

Clue 4 says the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. Clue 6 says there are two houses between the person who ate spaghetti and the bird keeper. Clue 11 says the bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples. 

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives in the 5th house. Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live next to each other. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 4th house.

Now, let's look at the fruits. We know the person eating mangos lives in the 1st house, and the person eating oranges lives in the 2nd house. Clue 14 says there is one house between the dog owner and the person eating kiwis. Clue 11 says the bird keeper lives to the right of the person eating apples. 

The only house left for the person eating grapes is the 4th house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 4th house. The only house left for the person eating grapes is the 1st house, but we already know the person eating mangos lives in the 1st house. The only house left for the person eating grapes is the 5th house, but we already know the person who had pizza lives in the 5th house. The only house left for the person eating grapes is the 3rd house, but we already know the fish enthusiast lives in the 3rd house. The only house left for the person eating grapes is the 2nd house, but we already know the person eating oranges lives in the 2nd house.

Wait, I made a mistake. The person eating grapes can live in the 4th house, but the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 4th house. Maybe the person who ate grilled cheese is eating grapes.

The answer is (B) 4."

The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and the person who is eating mangos also lives directly left of the person who likes red. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. 

So, the order is: green, mangos, pizza, and then red. But we don't know where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives. 

From clue 11, the person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

So, we know the baseball player lives in the second house, and they drive a convertible. That's from clues 2 and 3. 

Now, we know the person eatin' grapes don't live in the first house, that's clue 1. So, if they don't live in the first house, they must live in the second house. But we already know the second house is the baseball player, and they drive a convertible. 

So, that means the person eatin' mangos must live in the first house. 'Cause if the person eatin' grapes lives in the second house, and the second house is the baseball player, then the person eatin' mangos gotta be in the first house.

From clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. 

From clue 3, we know the truck owner lives directly left of the sedan owner. 

So, if we put the truck owner in house 1, the sedan owner would be in house 2. Then, there would be two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner, so the dog owner would be in house 4.

Now, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner, so the fish enthusiast would be in house 3.

This seems to fit all the clues, so I think the dog owner lives in house 4."

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 7, the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. 

From clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. 
From clue 9, the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. 
So, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white, and that person is the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 3, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. 
Since the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, the fantasy book enthusiast must live to the left of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. 
From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.

Now, let's try to put some of these together. 
The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. 
The person who likes yellow can't live in the fifth house, 'cause that's the person who likes blue. 
The person who likes yellow can't live in the fourth house, 'cause then the cricketer and the fantasy book enthusiast would have to live in the first and second houses, and there wouldn't be room for the person who likes green and the person who is eating mangos.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. 
That means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, and the cricketer lives in the first house.

From clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. 
So, the person who likes white lives in the second house, but we already know that's the fantasy book enthusiast. 
Wait, that's not right. 
The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house. 
But we already know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. 
So, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

Now we know the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who likes white lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. 
The person who likes green can't live in the first house, 'cause that's the cricketer. 
The person who likes green can't live in the second house, 'cause that's the person who likes white. 
The person who likes green can't live in the fifth house, 'cause that's the person who likes blue. 
The person who likes green can't live in the fourth house, 'cause then the swimmer would have to live in the third house, and we already know that's the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the person who likes green must live in the third house, but we already know that's the fantasy book enthusiast. 
Wait, that's not right. 
The person who likes green must live in the third house, but we already know that's the fantasy book enthusiast, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house. 
So, the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, but we already know that's the person who likes yellow. 
The person who likes green must live in the third house, but we already know that's the fantasy book enthusiast.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the cellist lives to the left of the person with the gameboy. If the cellist lived in house 2, then the person with the gameboy would have to live to the right of them, but there ain't no house to the right of house 2. So the cellist must live in house 1.

Now, we know the dog owner don't live in the first house, so that means the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person with the minivan lives in the first house. We also know the person with the gameboy lives in the third house. 

The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the SUV. Since the person with the gameboy lives in the third house, the person with the phone and the SUV must live in either the first and second or the second and third house. But the person with the minivan lives in the first house, so the person with the phone and the SUV must live in the second and third house. But the person with the gameboy lives in the third house, so the person with the phone lives in the second house and the person with the SUV lives in the third house, but that's not possible since the person with the gameboy lives in the third house.

So the person with the phone and the SUV must live in the second and fourth house. The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the SUV, so the person with the SUV lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."

From clue 6, the person with a computer lives in the second house.

The cr"
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. That means the person who had pizza can't live in house 1, 'cause there ain't nobody to the left of house 1. 

So, the person who had pizza must live in house 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the first house. 
From clue 5, the tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza. 
So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. 
From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. 
So, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house (because the tea drinker lives there), and it can't live in the second house (because the person who had pizza lives there). 
The person who ate spaghetti can't live in the fourth house either, because then the person who only drinks water would have to live in the third house, and the person who likes milk would have to live in the first or second house, but the first house is taken by the tea drinker, and the second house is taken by the person who had pizza. 
So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. 
So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
So, the person who likes milk lives in the first or second house. 
But the first house is taken by the tea drinker, so the person who likes milk lives in the second house, but the second house is taken by the person who had pizza. 
Wait, I made a mistake. The person who likes milk can't live in the second house. 
From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. 
From clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. 
From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. 
So, the person who likes milk lives in the first house, no, that's the tea drinker. 
The person who likes milk lives in the second house, no, that's the person who had pizza. 
The person who likes milk lives in the third house, no, that's the person who ate spaghetti. 
The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, no, that's the person who only drinks water.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 4, we know the dog owner lives in the third house. 
From clue 12, we know the person who likes white lives in the third house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. 
But we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the soccer player lives in the third house. We also know the golfer lives to the left of the basketball player. So, the order for the sports is golfer, basketball player, soccer player.

Now, the person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be the soccer player. 

So, the order for the food is: grilled cheese, ?, spaghetti. 

The person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. If the person who ate grilled cheese lived in the third house, there would be no one to the left of them. So, the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the third house. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lived in the second house, the person with lilies would have to live in the first house. But then the golfer would have to live in the first house, and the basketball player would have to live in the second house. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti is the soccer player, who lives in the third house.

"I think I can figger this out. 

If the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, that means the science fiction book fanatic can't live in house 2, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of house 2. 

So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. That's the only way it makes sense.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the pianist lives in the first house. Now, the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. 

The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. If the person who owns horses lived in the first house, then the root beer lover would have to live in the second house, but that's not possible since the pianist lives in the first house and the pianist can't live to the right of the horse owner. So, the horse owner must live in the second house.

Now, the root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner, but the horse owner lives in the second house, so the root beer lover can't live to the right of the horse owner. That means the root beer lover must live in the first house, but that's not possible since the pianist lives in the first house. Wait, I made a mistake. The root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner, so the root beer lover must live in the second house.

So, the pianist lives in the first house and likes white. The horse owner lives in the second house and the root beer lover lives in the second house. That means the person who owns a dog lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who eats apples lives in the third house. The person who eats mangos lives to the left of the person who eats apples, so the person who eats mangos lives in the second house.

Now, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes milk. The coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house, so the coffee drinker must live in the first house. 

If the coffee drinker lives in the first house, then the person who likes milk must live to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the person who eats mangos lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house, but that's where the person who eats apples lives. Wait, that can't be right.

Let's try again. If the coffee drinker lives in the first house, then the person who likes milk must live to the right of the coffee drinker. The person who eats mangos lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house, but that's not possible. 

So, the person who eats mangos lives in the second house, and the person who eats apples lives in the third house. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes milk, and the coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house. That means the coffee drinker lives in the first house, and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 4, we know the person with carnations lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person with carnations lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the person with tulips must live in the second house. But wait, clue 1 says the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house. So, the person with tulips and the science fiction book fanatic are the same person.

From clue 7, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person with tulips lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house, so the person with tulips and the person who is wearing loafers are the same person.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who only drinks water lives in the first house (Clue 2). We also know there's one house between the person who drinks water and the person who likes milk (Clue 1). So, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

Now, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house (Clue 4). And the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (Clue 3). So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house and the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, they must be the same person.

Now we have the first house: person who drinks water and has a vase of tulips.
The second house: person who has a bouquet of lilies.
The third house: person who likes milk.

The only one left is the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the first and second houses are taken, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house, but we already know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk must be the same person.

But wait, we were asked about the person who has a rose bouquet, and we know they live in the third house. However, the options don't have a 3 as the correct answer for the person who has a rose bouquet and likes milk. But we do have a 3 as an option for the person who has a rose bouquet."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, the cricketer can't live in the first house. 

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 3, the person who has a gameboy lives directly next to the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a gameboy lives in either the second or the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. 

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. So, the person who has a phone lives in the first house. But from clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the person who has a phone and the person who is wearing loafers are the same person.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. So, the person who has a radio lives in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the third or the fourth house. But from clue 3, the person who has a gameboy lives directly next to the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the tennis player and the person who likes yellow are the same person.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. The cricketer can't live in the first house (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house), the third house (since the tennis player lives in the third house), or the fourth house (since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house). So, the cricketer lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"That's an easy one. I know the answer 'cause it's right in the clues. It says in clue 4, ""The person who likes yellow lives in the first house."" So the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. 

From clue 2, the golfer doesn't live in the second house. 

From clue 3, the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.

From clue 4, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.

From clue 5, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

Now, let's put the clues together. 

If the person with a television lives in house 2, then the tennis player lives in house 1 (clue 1). But then the person with a radio would have to live in house 3 (clue 5), and the person with a rose bouquet would have to live in house 1 or 2 (clue 4). But if the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 1, then the person with a computer and the person with tulips can't live next to each other (clue 3). And if the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2, then the person with a television can't live in house 2. 

So, the person with a television must live in house 3. 

Then the person with a radio lives in house 2 or 3 (clue 5), but since the person with a television lives in house 3, the person with a radio must live in house 2 (clue 5). 

The person with a rose bouquet lives in house 1 (clue 4). 

The tennis player lives in house 1 (clue 1). 

The golfer doesn't live in house 2 (clue 2), so the golfer lives in house 1 or 3. But the tennis player lives in house 1, so the golfer lives in house 3. But the person with a television lives in house 3, so the golfer can't live in house 3. 

Wait, I made a mistake. The golfer can't live in house 1, because the tennis player lives in house 1. And the golfer can't live in house 2 (clue 2). So the golfer must live in house 3, but that's not possible.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker. 
From clue 6, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. 
So, the order is: pizza, tea drinker, yellow. 

From clue 11, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. 
From clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. 
So, the order is: pizza, oranges, apples. 

Now, we combine the two orders: pizza, tea drinker, yellow and pizza, oranges, apples. 
Since the tea drinker and yellow are together, and oranges and apples are together, the order is: pizza, tea drinker, yellow, oranges, apples. 

But there are only 4 houses, so the order must be: pizza, tea drinker, oranges, apples or pizza, oranges, tea drinker, yellow. 

From clue 1, the root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. 
From clue 3, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person with the television lives in the 4th house. We also know the person with loafers lives in the 2nd house. 

The person with boots lives to the left of the person with loafers, so the person with boots must live in the 1st house.

The person with the phone doesn't live in the 2nd house, but we don't know where they live yet.

Now, there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with sandals. If the person with the radio lived in the 1st house, the person with sandals would have to live in the 4th house, but the person with the television lives in the 4th house. So, the person with the radio can't live in the 1st house. 

If the person with the radio lived in the 2nd house, the person with sandals would have to live in the 4th house, but the person with the television lives in the 4th house. So, the person with the radio can't live in the 2nd house either.

If the person with the radio lived in the 3rd house, the person with sandals would have to live in the 1st or the 5th house, but there is no 5th house. But we already know the person with boots lives in the 1st house, so the person with sandals can't live in the 1st house. 

So, the person with the radio must live in the 3rd house, and the person with sandals must live in the 1st house, but we already know the person with boots lives in the 1st house. Wait, that can't be right.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the golfer lives in the second house, so that's house 2. We also know the history book buff lives in the first house, so that's house 1.

Now, we know there's one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. If the science fiction book fanatic lived in house 1, then the swimmer would have to live in house 3, but that would mean the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are the same person, which can't be. 

So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3. That means the swimmer lives in house 1, but we know the history book buff lives in house 1. Wait, that can't be right.

Let's try again. If the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, then the swimmer must live in house 1, but we know the history book buff lives in house 1. That means the swimmer can't live in house 1.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, and the swimmer lives in house 1 is not correct. The only other option is that the swimmer lives in house 3 is not correct, so the swimmer must live in house 1 is not correct, so the swimmer lives in house 3 is not correct, so the swimmer must live in house 1 is not correct, so the swimmer lives in house 3 is not correct, so the swimmer must live in house 1 is not correct, so the swimmer lives in house 3 is not correct, so the swimmer must live

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house. 

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. And from clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. 

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses. And from clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. 

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. 

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. And from clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Now, let's try to put all these clues together. 

House 1: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast (clue 10). The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses (clue 3). The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player (clue 7). The person who is eating grapes can't be in house 1 because then the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who owns horses would have to be in houses 2 and 3, but the bird keeper lives in house 3 (clue 8). So, the person who is eating grapes can't be in house 1. 

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (clue 4). The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (clue 11). The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 9). The person who had pizza can't be in house 1 because then the science fiction book fanatic would have to be in house 0, which doesn't exist. The person who had pizza can't be in house 4 because then the baseball player would have to be in house 5, which doesn't exist. The person who had pizza can't be in house 3 because the bird keeper lives in house 3 (clue 8). So, the person who had pizza must be in house 2. 

The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 9). So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. 

The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff (clue 6). The cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 5). The person who ate spaghetti can't be in house 1 because then the cat lover would have to be in house 0, which doesn't exist. The person who ate spaghetti can't be in house 4 because then the history book buff would have to be in house 5, which doesn't exist. The person who ate spaghetti can't be in house 3 because the bird keeper lives in house 3 (clue 8). So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2, but the person who had pizza is already in house 2. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 is not possible. The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4 is not possible. The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 is not possible. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 is not possible, house 3 is not possible, and house 4 is not possible.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses. Since there are only two houses, the person wearing sandals must live in house 1, and the person who owns horses must live in house 2.

Now, from clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1, and the history book buff must live in house 2.

But wait, we already know the person who owns horses lives in house 2. So, the person who owns horses must also be the history book buff.

Now, let's go back to the person who ate spaghetti. They live in house 1 and wear sandals (from clue 1).

"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 1, we know the person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies. That means the person with lilies can't live in house 1, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So, the person with lilies must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says the flutist don't live in house 1. That's okay, 'cause we already figgered out the person with lilies lives in house 2. We don't know who's the flutist or who's the saxophonist yet, but we know the person with lilies lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

From clue 3, the person with carnations lives in the 4th house. 
From clue 7, the tennis player doesn't live in the 4th house, so the tennis player lives in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd house.

From clue 2, the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 
From clue 1, there's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. 
From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. 
So, the order for these three is: mystery book reader, fantasy book enthusiast, swimmer.

From clue 9, there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover. 
Since the mystery book reader can't live in the 4th house (because of the tennis player and the swimmer), the mystery book reader must live in either the 1st or 2nd house.

If the mystery book reader lives in the 1st house, then the romance book lover would live in the 4th house, but that's not possible because the person with carnations lives in the 4th house (clue 3), and the romance book lover can't live with carnations (because each person has different flowers).

So, the mystery book reader must live in the 2nd house. 
Then the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 3rd house (directly left of the swimmer), and the swimmer lives in the 4th house (but that's not possible because the person with carnations lives in the 4th house).

"From clue 8, the golfer lives in the first house.

Clue 7 says the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.

Clue 9 says the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house, and the person who had pizza does not live in the second house (clue 5), the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house.

The person who likes white can't live in the fourth house, because the person who likes red lives in the fourth house. The person who likes white can't live in the third house, because the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. The person who likes white can't live in the second house, because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person who likes white must live in the first house, but the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

The person who likes white can't live in the first house, so the person who ate grilled cheese can't live to the right of the person who likes white. The person who ate grilled cheese must live to the left of the person who likes white. The person who likes white can't live in the fifth house, or the person who ate grilled cheese would have to live in a non-existent house to the left. The person who likes white can't live in the fourth house, because the person who likes red lives in the fourth house. The person who likes white can't live in the third house, because the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. The person who likes white can't live in the second house, because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person who likes white must live in the first house, but the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. The person who likes white can't live in the first house, or the person who likes yellow would have to live in a non-existent house to the left. The person who likes white can't live in the fifth house, or the person who likes yellow would have to live in a non-existent house to the right. The person who likes white can't live in the fourth house, because the person who likes red lives in the fourth house. The person who likes white can't live in the third house, because the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. The person who likes white must live in the second house.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person who likes red lives in the third house. We also know the percussionist lives in the second house. 

The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player, so the basketball player can't live in the third house, 'cause there's no one to the right of the third house. 

The basketball player also lives to the right of the tennis player. If the basketball player lived in the second house, the tennis player would have to live in the first house. But the percussionist lives in the second house, so that can't be right.

So the tennis player must live in the first house, and the basketball player lives in the second house."

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the coffee drinker live next to each other. Clue 10 says the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes milk. Clue 14 says there's one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the coffee drinker.

Now, let's try to put it all together. We know the person who has a carnations arrangement doesn't live in the third house (clue 7) or the fifth house (clue 16). 

If we look at the clues again, we can see that the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first house (E) or the second house (B). 

But, if the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, then the person who has a bouquet of daffodils would have to live in the second house (because of clue 5 and the fact that there's one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the coffee drinker). 

However, if the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, then the person who has a vase of tulips would have to live in the first house (because of clue 2). But then, the person who has a carnations arrangement wouldn't be able to live in the first house.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house (B)."

From clue 6, the saxophonist lives in the first house. 
So, the person in the first house is a basketball player and a saxophonist.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. 
Since the person in the first house is a basketball player and a saxophonist, and they didn't have pizza (because the person who had pizza lives left of the dog owner), the person in the first house must have had something else for lunch.

Now, let's look at the drinks. 
From clue 2, the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.

Now, let's look at the pets. 
From clue 1, there is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. 
Since the person in the first house is a basketball player, a saxophonist, had stew, and is a tea drinker, they could be the cat lover (because there is one house between the cat lover and the guitarist).

Let's try again. 
The person in the second house is a cricketer, had pizza, only drinks water, and is a violinist (because the saxophonist is in the first house, and the guitarist is in the third house).

From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the history book buff lives in the first house. We also know the cat lover doesn't live in the second house, so the cat lover must live in the first house. 

Now, the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the person with daffodils must live in the second house. 

The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils, so the person wearing high heels must live in the first house. 

The person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer. If the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, then the person with a computer must live in the first house. But we already know the cat lover lives in the first house, and the cat lover can't have a computer and a cat, and also be a history book buff, and wear high heels. That's too many things. So, the person with a computer must live in the second house, and the person wearing loafers must live in the second house too. But we already know the person with daffodils lives in the second house, and the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, so the person with daffodils and the person wearing loafers must be the same person.

- House 1: history book buff, cat lover, high heels
- House 2: daffodils, computer, loafers, fish enthusiast (because the other person is a cat lover), and romance book lover (because the other person is a history book buff)

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, we know the pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. 

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. 

From clue 4, we know there's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's think about it. If the person eating kiwis lives in house 1, then the violinist would have to live in house 3 (because of clue 4), and the person eating grapes would have to live in house 2 (because of clue 3). But then the pianist wouldn't be next to the person eating kiwis (because of clue 1). 

If the person eating kiwis lives in house 3, then the violinist would have to live in house 1 (because of clue 4), and the person eating grapes would have to live in house 2 (because of clue 3). But then the pianist wouldn't be next to the person eating kiwis (because of clue 1).

So, the person eating kiwis must live in house 2. Then the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3 (because of clue 1). But the violinist lives to the left of the flutist (because of clue 2), and there's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (because of clue 4). So, the violinist must live in house 1, and the flutist must live in house 3. 

That means the pianist must live in house 3 doesn't work, because the flutist lives in house 3. So, the pianist must live in house 1 doesn't work either, because the violinist lives in house 1. Wait, that's not true. The pianist can live in house 1, and the violinist can live in house 1 too. No, that's not right. 

Let's try again. If the person eating kiwis lives in house 2, then the pianist must live in either house 1 or house 3. But the violinist lives to the left of the flutist (because of clue 2), and there's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (because of clue 4). So, the violinist must live in house 1, and the flutist must live in house 3. 

That means the pianist must live in house 3 doesn't work, because the flutist lives in house 3. So, the pianist must live in house 1."
"I think I can figger this out. 

So, we know the person in the first house is eatin' kiwis. And we know the fantasy book enthusiast don't live in the first house. That means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house, 'cause there's only two houses.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 
From clue 8, the person who likes red lives in the third house. 
From clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow, so that's either house 2, 3, or 4. 
From clue 1, the bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other. 
From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

Now, if the person who likes red lives in the third house, and the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, and the bird keeper lives next to the person who has a television, then the person who has a television can't live in the third house 'cause the person who likes red lives there. So the person who has a television must live in the fourth house, and the bird keeper lives in the third house, but that can't be 'cause the person who likes red lives in the third house. So the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house, but that can't be neither 'cause the person who likes red lives in the third house. So the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the fourth house.

But wait, I made a mistake. The person who has a television can't live in the fourth house 'cause the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house (clue 7). So the person who has a television must live in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the first house, but that can't be 'cause the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house, but that can't be neither 'cause the person who likes red lives in the third house. So the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the second house too, but that can't be 'cause they live next to each other. So the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house, no, that can't be.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 10, the swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other. Clue 4 says the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. Clue 3 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white. So, the order is: swimmer, person who likes white, person who only drinks water.

From clue 9, there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. So, the order is: swimmer, person who likes white, person who only drinks water, tea drinker.

From clue 12, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. So, the person who likes blue must live in house 1, 2, or 3. 

From clue 1, there are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating apples. If the person who likes blue lives in house 1, then the person who is eating apples lives in house 4. If the person who likes blue lives in house 2, then the person who is eating apples lives in house 5 (but there are only 4 houses). If the person who likes blue lives in house 3, then the person who is eating apples lives in house 1 (but that would mean the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is eating apples, not the left). So, the person who likes blue must live in house 1.

From clue 8, there is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating oranges. So, the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3.

From clue 5, there is one house between the person who is eating grapes and the tennis player. From clue 7, the saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player. From clue 6, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who likes green. 

From clue 11, the coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. The only house left for the pianist is house 2 or 4. But if the pianist lives in house 4, then the coffee drinker would have to live in house 5 (but there are only 4 houses). So, the pianist must live in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house (clue 2). We also know the person who likes green lives in the second house (clue 4). 

Now, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 5). Since the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house (clue 1), they must live in the second house. This means the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.

The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew (clue 6). Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in either the second or third house. But the person who had stew does not live in the second house (clue 7), so they must live in the third house.

Now, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house (clue 3). Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

Now, from clue 2, we know the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement. And from clue 3, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the person with the vase of tulips. So, the order is: carnations, romance book lover, tulips.

So, if the person with the radio lives in house 2, that means the person with the phone must live in house 1, 'cause that's the only other house left.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. That's house 2.

We also know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. And there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.

If the person who likes yellow lives in house 2, then the person who owns a sedan would have to live in house 3. But then there wouldn't be a house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan. 

So the person who likes yellow can't live in house 2. And since they live directly left of the person who owns a sedan, they must live in house 1. That way, the person who owns a sedan can live in house 3, and there's a house (house 2) between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan.

So the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, there are two houses between the person wearing running shoes and the bird keeper. So the bird keeper lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the person wearing sandals lives in the first, second, or third house. But the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house, so the person wearing sandals lives in the second or third house.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. 

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house.

From clue 9, the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 6, the person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 10, the person wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives to the right of the person who drives a minivan.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. 

The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. The person wearing sandals lives in the second house (because if they lived in the third house, the person wearing high heels would have to live in the second house, and the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, but the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house). 

The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. The bird keeper lives in the fourth house.

The person wearing high heels lives in the fifth house is possible. The person who drives a truck lives in the fifth house is not possible, because the person wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house, and the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. And from clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house too. So, the person who ate fried rice is also the fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, from clue 2, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house too. But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. So, the person who ate spaghetti is also the science fiction book fanatic.

Now we know the first house has the person who ate spaghetti and is a science fiction book fanatic, and the second house has the person who ate fried rice and is a fantasy book enthusiast. That leaves the third house for the person who ate grilled cheese.

So, the answer is (C) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. 

If the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the dog owner can't be in house 1, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So the dog owner must be in house 2.

Now, since the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the person with carnations must be in house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house. So, house 2 is the one with the kiwi eater.

We also know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. 

Now, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, and they live directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. That means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. So, the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

From clue 2, the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing sandals lives in house 2, the person eating grapes must live in house 2 as well.

Now, if the person eating grapes lives in house 2, then the person eating kiwis must live in house 1.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. We also know the violinist and the guitarist don't live next to each other, 'cause there's one house between 'em. 

If the violinist lived in the first house, that would mean the tea drinker and the violinist are the same person, but we don't know that. So let's try the violinist in the second house. That would mean the guitarist lives in the first or the third house. But we know the tea drinker lives in the first house, so the guitarist can't live there. That would mean the guitarist lives in the third house.

Now, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. If the cellist lived in the first house, that would mean the water drinker lives in the second or the third house. But we already figured out the violinist lives in the second house, so the cellist can't live in the first house. That would mean the cellist lives in the second house, but we already said the violinist lives in the second house. So the cellist must live in the first house, but we said the tea drinker lives in the first house. That can't be right.

Let's try again. What if the violinist lives in the second house, and the cellist lives in the first house? No, we already said the tea drinker lives in the first house. So what if the violinist lives in the second house, and the cellist lives in the third house? That would mean the water drinker lives in the third house, but we already said the cellist lives in the third house. That can't be right.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. If the bird keeper lived in house 2, then the person who ate grilled cheese would have to live to the right of house 2, but there ain't no house to the right of house 2. So the bird keeper must live in house 1.

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2.

We also know the percussionist don't live in house 2. So the percussionist must live in house 1.

Now we got the bird keeper and the percussionist in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 2. That means the person who had pizza must live in house 1, but we already know the percussionist lives in house 1, and the bird keeper lives in house 1. So the person who had pizza must be the percussionist, but that's not what we're lookin' for. We're lookin' for the house number. 

Since the person who had pizza lives in house 1, the answer is (B) 1."
"That's a tough one. Let me think for a sec. Alright, so we know the bird keeper lives in the third house, right? That's what clue 2 says. So, the answer is pretty simple. 

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 10, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house too, or the fish enthusiast would be in the first house. But we know the cat lover is in the first house, so the person eating a banana must be the cat lover.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house too, or the fish enthusiast would be in the first house. But we know the cat lover is in the first house, so the person wearing running shoes must be the cat lover.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house too, or the flutist would be in the first house. But we know the cat lover is in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be the cat lover.

Now we know the first house has a cat lover, who eats bananas and wears running shoes, and likes fantasy books.

From clue 6, the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person eating a banana, who is in the first house. So the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

From clue 7, the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist. Since the flutist is in the third house, the person eating oranges must be in the third house too, or the pianist would be in the third house. But we know the flutist is in the third house, so the person eating oranges must be the flutist.

From clue 1, the person wearing loafers does not live in the second house. From clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. From clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. We already know the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house. The second house must have the fish enthusiast, who eats apples (since the cat lover eats bananas and the flutist eats oranges), and wears high heels (since the cat lover wears running shoes and the flutist can't wear loafers), and likes history books (since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the second house).

Now we know the second house has a fish enthusiast, who eats apples and wears high heels, and likes history books.

The only one left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be the pianist, who eats something (but not bananas or apples or oranges, so it must be something else, but we don't know what), and wears loafers (since the cat lover wears running shoes and the fish enthusiast wears high heels), and lives in the second house (no, wait, that can't be right...). 

From clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. The pianist can't live in the second house either, since the science fiction book fanatic can't live in the second house. The flutist lives in the third house, so the pianist must live in the second house, and the percussionist must live in the first house (no, wait, that can't be right...). The percussionist can't live in the first house, since the cat lover is in the first house, and the cat lover is not the percussionist (since the cat lover is the fantasy book enthusiast). The percussionist must live in the third house (no, wait, that can't be right...). The flutist lives in the third house, so the percussionist must live in the second house (no, wait, that can't be right...). The percussionist can't live in the second house, since clue 2 says so. The pianist must live in the second house, and the percussionist must live in the third house (no, wait, that can't be right...).

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person eating grapes lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. And from clue 5, there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. 

So, if we put the person who likes red in the 4th house, the person who likes green would be in the 3rd house, and the person who likes white would be in the 1st house. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person eating kiwis can't be in the 4th house (that's the person who likes red), and they can't be in the 3rd house (that's the person who likes green). They can't be in the 2nd house either, 'cause that's the person eating grapes. 

So, the person eating kiwis must be in the 1st house, but we already put the person who likes white in the 1st house. Wait, that's not right. 

Let's try again. If we put the person who likes red in the 3rd house, the person who likes green would be in the 2nd house, but we already know the person eating grapes lives in the 2nd house. So, that can't be right. 

Let's try again. If we put the person who likes red in the 4th house, the person who likes green would be in the 3rd house, and the person who likes white would be in the 1st or 2nd house. But we already know the person eating grapes lives in the 2nd house. So, the person who likes white must be in the 1st house. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person eating kiwis can't be in the 4th house (that's the person who likes red), and they can't be in the 3rd house (that's the person who likes green), and they can't be in the 2nd house (that's the person eating grapes). 

So, the person eating kiwis must be in the 1st house, but we already put the person who likes white in the 1st house. Wait, that's not right. 

Let's try again. If the person who likes white is in the 1st house, and there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana (clue 3), then the person eating a banana must be in the 3rd house. But we already know the person who likes green is in the 3rd house. So, the person who likes green must be eating a banana. 

Now, from clue 4, the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the 4th house. 

But we already know the person who likes red is in the 4th house. So, the person who likes red must also like yellow. But that's not right, 'cause each person has a different favorite color. 

Let's try again. If the person who likes white is in the 1st house, and there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana (clue 3), then the person eating a banana must be in the 3rd house. But we already know the person who likes green is in the 3rd house. So, the person who likes green must be eating a banana. 

Now, from clue 4, the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the 4th house. But we already know the person who likes red is in the 4th house. So, the person who likes yellow can't be in the 4th house. 

Let's try again. If the person who likes white is in the 2nd house, and there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana (clue 3), then the person eating a banana must be in the 4th house. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person eating kiwis can't be in the 4th house (that's the person eating a banana), and they can't be in the 3rd house (that's the person who likes green), and they can't be in the 2nd house (that's the person eating grapes and the person who likes white). 

So, the person eating kiwis must be in the 1st house.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives to the left of the cat lover. Since there are only two houses, this means the mystery book reader lives in house 1 and the cat lover lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other. Since the mystery book reader lives in house 1, the person who had stew must live in house 1 as well, or house 2. But we know the cat lover lives in house 2, and the person who had stew can't live next to the cat lover, so the person who had stew must live in house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the root beer lover lives in the first house. We also know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. That means the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the person in the first house is wearing loafers. 

From clue 7, the person eating kiwis is not in the first house. 

From clue 5, the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk. So, the person eating kiwis must be in the second house, and the person who likes milk is in the third house.

From clue 3, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third house, and the person eating grapes must be in the second house. But we already know the person eating kiwis is in the second house, so this can't be right. 

Wait, I made a mistake. The person eating grapes can't be in the second house. The person eating kiwis is in the second house, and the person eating grapes must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water is in the second house, no, that can't be right either.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 5, the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player. 
From clue 4, the person with carnations lives next to the person with horses. 
So, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be in either house 1 and 2, in that order, or house 2 and 3, in that order.

From clue 2, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person with horses. 
If the person with horses lives in house 3, then the fish enthusiast must live in house 2, and the person with carnations must live in house 1. But then, from clue 5, the baseball player must live in house 2 or 3, and from clue 3, the golfer must live in house 1 or 2. But this contradicts clue 1, which says the golfer does not live in the third house. So, the person with horses cannot live in house 3.

From clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with daffodils. 
If the person with horses lives in house 1, then the person with carnations must live in house 2 (from clue 4), and the person with daffodils must live in house 3 (from clue 6). But then, from clue 5, the baseball player must live in house 3, which contradicts clue 7, which says the cricketer does not live in the third house, and also contradicts clue 3, which says the golfer and the baseball player live next to each other.

So, the person with horses must live in house 2."

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 
From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. 
From clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. 

So, the order for these three is: history book buff, mystery book reader, romance book lover. 

From clue 2, the percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 
From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. 

So, the order for these five is: history book buff, mystery book reader, romance book lover, guitarist, percussionist. 

But from clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. 
So, the science fiction book fanatic must be the romance book lover. 

So, the order for these five is: history book buff, mystery book reader, science fiction book fanatic, guitarist, percussionist. 

Now, let's look at the houses. 
The history book buff can't be in house 1, because then the mystery book reader would be in house 2, and the science fiction book fanatic would be in house 3, and the guitarist would be in house 4, and the percussionist would be in house 5. 
But from clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. 
So, the percussionist can't be in house 5. 

So, the history book buff must be in house 2, the mystery book reader in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic in house 4, the guitarist in house 4 doesn't work, so the guitarist must be in house 3 doesn't work, so the guitarist must be in house 2 doesn't work, so the guitarist must be in house 5 doesn't work, so the guitarist must be in house 4 doesn't work, so the guitarist must be in house

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 10, the romance book lover lives in the third house. Clue 18 says the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. Clue 15 says there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives. Clue 17 says the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, and there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, but that's where the romance book lover lives, so that can't be right. The person who is eating apples must live in the second house, but that's where the person who is eating grapes lives, so that can't be right either. The person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, and the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, but that's where the person who is eating grapes lives, so the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house, but that's where the person who owns a sedan lives, so that can't be right. The person who drives a minivan must live in the fifth house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

Clue 12 says the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Clue 13 says the person who likes white does not live in the fourth house. Clue 5 says the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Clue 8 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green. Clue 16 says the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Clue 6 says there is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Clue 11 says the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Clue 7 says there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. Clue 4 says the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. Clue 3 says the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Clue 9 says the person who likes red does not live in the first house.

I'm getting a headache from all these clues. Let me try to put the pieces together. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

The person who owns an SUV must live in the first house, but that's where the person who owns a sedan lives, so that can't be right. The person who owns an SUV must live in the fifth house, but that's where the person who drives a minivan lives, so that can't be right. Wait, I made a mistake.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. 

From clue 1, the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. 

From clue 2, the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. 

Now, if the cellist lives in house 1, then the mystery book reader must live in house 2. But then the history book buff can't live to the left of the cat lover, 'cause there's no room left. 

So the cellist must live in house 1, and the history book buff must live in house 1 too. That means the cat lover lives in house 2. 

Now, the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. If the root beer lover lives in house 1, then the guitarist lives in house 2, but that's where the cat lover lives. So the root beer lover must live in house 2, and the guitarist lives in house 1. 

But the cellist lives in house 1, so the guitarist can't live there. Wait, that means the cellist must be the tea drinker, 'cause the root beer lover lives in house 2. 

Now, the history book buff lives in house 1, and the mystery book reader lives in house 2. The cat lover lives in house 2, so the person who owns horses must live in house 1.

We know the dog owner don't live in the second house. So, the dog owner must live in either the first or the third house. 

Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner lives in the first house, then the person with tulips must live in either the second or the third house. But if the dog owner lives in the third house, then there ain't no house to the right of the dog owner, so that can't be right.

So, the dog owner lives in the first house. Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner, so that's either the second or the third house. But we also know the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. If the bird keeper lives in the second house, then the person with carnations must live in the third house. But then there ain't no house left for the person with tulips to live to the right of the dog owner. So, the bird keeper can't live in the second house.

That means the bird keeper must live in the first house, but we already said the dog owner lives in the first house. So, that can't be right. Or maybe... the bird keeper lives in the third house, and the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper, but there ain't no house to the right of the third house. So, that can't be right either.

Wait, I got it. The dog owner lives in the first house, and the bird keeper lives in the second house. Then the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper, so that's the third house. And the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner, so that's the second or the third house. But the third house is already taken by the person with carnations, so the person with tulips must live in the second house.

So, the banana eater must live in either the first or second house. But we know the mango eater lives in the first house, so the banana eater must live in the second house.

Now, we know the bird keeper and the kiwi eater live next to each other. They can't live in the first and second houses 'cause the mango eater and banana eater live there. They can't live in the third and fourth houses 'cause the dog owner lives in the third house, and the person eating a banana lives to the left of the dog owner.

The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the bird keeper can't live in the first house (that's the mystery book reader), the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the third house.

Now, we know the romance book lover doesn't live in the third house, and the person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house either. The mystery book reader lives in the first house, so the romance book lover must live in the second house, but we already said the bird keeper lives in the second house. Wait, that can't be right.

Let's try again. The bird keeper lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house. The mystery book reader lives in the first house. The romance book lover doesn't live in the third house, and the person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house either. 

So, the romance book lover must live in the first or second house. But the mystery book reader lives in the first house, so the romance book lover must live in the second house. But we already said the bird keeper lives in the second house. That means the bird keeper and the romance book lover can't both live in the second house.

Let's try again. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. The history book buff can't live in the first or second house, or the bird keeper would have to live in the house to the left of the first house, which doesn't exist. So, the history book buff lives in the third house, and the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The mystery book reader lives in the first house. The romance book lover doesn't live in the third house, and the person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house either.

Wait, I got it. The bird keeper lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house. The mystery book reader lives in the first house. The romance book lover doesn't live in the third house, and the person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house either.

Let's try again. The bird"
"That's an easy one. The answer is (D) 2. It says right in the clues, ""The coffee drinker lives in the second house."""
That's an easy one.  The person who is eating a banana lives in house number 3. I know this 'cause it says so in clue 12.
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. 

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player lives in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the golfer must live in either the second or third house. But the soccer player lives in the second house, so the golfer must live in the third house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house. But the person who has a rose bouquet already lives in the first house, so this can't be right.

From clue 5, the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck. 
From clue 2, the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. 
From clue 5 and clue 2, the order is: truck, gameboy, minivan.

From clue 3, the person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. 
From clue 6, the flutist lives left of the person who drives a minivan. 
So, the order is: truck, gameboy, flutist, minivan, cellist. But that's 5 people and we only got 3 houses. So, some of these people gotta be the same. 

From clue 6, the flutist lives left of the person who drives a minivan. 
So, the flutist is the person who has a gameboy. 

Now we got: truck, flutist/gameboy, minivan, cellist. But we still got 4 people. 
From clue 4, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live next to each other. 
From clue 7, the person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist. 
From clue 1, the person who has a phone lives left of the person who drives a minivan. 
So, the person who has a phone is the person who drives a truck. 

Now we got: truck/phone, flutist/gameboy, minivan, cellist. 
The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other, so the person who drives a truck can't be the person who has a gameboy. 
The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other, so the person who drives a minivan can't be the cellist. 
The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live next to each other. 
The person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist. 
So, the order is: truck/phone, flutist/gameboy, minivan/cellist. 
The person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist is the person who drives a truck. 

The answer is (C) 1."
"That's a lot of clues. Let me try to figure it out. 

From clue 9, I know the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house. That's the answer right there.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 5, we know the person with lilies lives in the second house. 

From clue 2 and 3, we know the person with a rose bouquet and the person with an SUV live on either side of the coffee drinker. But, since the person with lilies lives in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet and the person with an SUV can't be in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet and the person with an SUV must be in the first and third house, or the first and second house isn't possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. But, the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house and the person with an SUV must be in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house and the person with an SUV must be in the third house. And the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker must be in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with lilies lives in the second house, and the person with an SUV lives in the third house. And the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker must be in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

Wait, I made a mistake. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the person with a rose bouquet can't be in the first house if the coffee drinker is in the third house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

Wait, I made another mistake. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the person with a rose bouquet can be in the second house if the coffee drinker is in the third house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet can't be in the second house, so the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the coffee drinker must be in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

Wait, I made another mistake. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the person with a rose bouquet can be in the first house if the coffee drinker is in the second house, but that's not possible since the person with lilies is in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet can be in the first house if the coffee drinker is in the third house, and the person with lilies is in the second house. 

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with lilies lives in the second house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew. 
From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. 
So, the person who had stew and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be the same person.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 
Since the person who had stew is also the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

From clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 
From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
From clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house. 
So, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together. 
The person who likes blue lives in the first house. 
The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew (clue 4), so the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house, but the person who likes blue lives in the first house, so the person who likes blue must drive a minivan.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house (since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies).

The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck (clue 3). 
The person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the first house (since the person who likes blue lives in the first house), so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house, but the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house.

From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. 
From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. 
From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. 
From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. 
So, the cellist must live in the second house, but that's not possible since the soccer player lives in the second house. 
The cellist must live in the first or the fourth house, but the fourth house is taken by the basketball player. 
So, the cellist lives in the first house. 

From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. 
So, the flutist lives in the second house, but that's not possible since the soccer player lives in the second house. 
The flutist lives in the third house, and the cellist lives in the first house, but the person who likes red lives in the third house. 
So, the person who likes red is the flutist, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, but that's not possible since the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 3, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. 
From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. 
From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. 
From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. 
So, the person who likes red lives in the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, but that's not possible since the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the person who likes red lives in the second house (clue 5). We also know the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red (clue 1), so the person eating grapes must live in the third house.

Now, the person who likes white lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes (clue 6), so the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the person who likes red lives in the second house, so the person who likes white must live in the first house.

We also know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house (clue 4). 

Now, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes (clue 2). Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, the person who has a phone can't live in the third house. If the person who has a phone lives in the second house, then the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the third house, but we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. So, the person who has a phone must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist. So, the guitarist can't be in the first house. 

From clue 1, the bird keeper lives in the second house."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

We know the saxophonist lives in house 1 (clue 4). The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other (clue 2), so the golfer must live in house 2.

The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other (clue 5), so the romance book lover must live in house 1.

The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other (clue 1). The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other (clue 3). Since the golfer lives in house 2, the person eating grapes must live in house 2, and the tea drinker must live in house 1.

Now, the person eating mangos must live in the other house, which is house 1, but we already know the saxophonist and the romance book lover live in house 1, and the tea drinker also lives in house 1. So, the person eating mangos must be the tea drinker, the romance book lover, or the saxophonist in house 1, but the person eating mangos is not the saxophonist or the romance book lover, because the saxophonist and the romance book lover are already in house 1, and the person eating grapes is in house 2, so the person eating mangos must be the tea drinker in house 1, but the tea drinker is not the correct answer, we are looking for the house number, so the answer is the house number of the tea drinker.

"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 12, we know the person eating apples lives in the 4th house. Clue 2 says the person eating apples lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader lives in the 5th house.

Clue 5 says the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person who likes green. Clue 13 says the person eating oranges lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the person who likes green must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd house.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Clue 6 says there are two houses between the romance book lover and the person who likes yellow. Clue 11 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.

Now, let's think about the person who likes green and the person who likes blue. They can't be in the 4th and 5th houses because the person eating apples and the mystery book reader are already there. They can't be in the 1st and 2nd houses because then there wouldn't be two houses between the romance book lover and the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes green and the person who likes blue must be in the 2nd and 3rd houses.

Clue 6 says there are two houses between the romance book lover and the person who likes yellow. If the person who likes yellow is in the 3rd house, then the romance book lover would be in the 1st house, but clue 15 says the person wearing running shoes lives in the 1st house, and we don't know if the romance book lover is wearing running shoes. But if the person who likes yellow is in the 4th house, then the romance book lover would be in the 1st house, but the person wearing running shoes lives in the 1st house. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the 5th house, and the romance book lover must be in the 1st house, but that's not possible because the person wearing running shoes lives in the 1st house. Wait, I made a mistake. If the person who likes yellow is in the 5th house, then the romance book lover would be in the 1st house, but that's not possible. If the person who likes yellow is in the 4th house, then the romance book lover would be in the 1st house, but that's not possible. If the person who likes yellow is in the 3rd house, then the romance book lover would be in the 1st house, but that's not possible.

That's an easy one.  The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house. The answer is (A) 1.
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 12, the root beer lover lives left of the person who only drinks water. 
From clue 2, the root beer lover lives left of the person who is wearing high heels. 
So, the order is: root beer lover, water drinker, high heels.

From clue 9, the water drinker lives left of the tea drinker. 
So, the order is: root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, high heels.

From clue 5, the tea drinker lives left of the person who had pizza. 
So, the order is: root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, pizza, high heels.

From clue 7, the person who had pizza lives left of the cricketer. 
So, the order is: root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, pizza, high heels, cricketer.

From clue 11, the cricketer lives right of the person who is wearing sandals. 
So, the order is: root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, pizza, high heels, sandals, cricketer.

But wait, that can't be right, 'cause the sandals can't be right of the high heels. 
So, the sandals must be left of the root beer lover. 
So, the order is: sandals, root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, pizza, high heels, cricketer.

Now, let's look at the houses. 
From clue 1, the coffee drinker doesn't live in the fourth house. 
From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the fifth house.

I think I've got it now. 
The order is: sandals, root beer lover, water drinker, tea drinker, pizza, high heels, cricketer. 
The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 4"
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the tea drinker lives in the first house. From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. So, the person who has a rose bouquet can't live in the first house. 

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house. 

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first or second house. 

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. 

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who had pizza. 

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house. 

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other. From clue 13, the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who likes green. So, the person who likes green can't live in the first house (A) or the second house (D). 

From clue 10, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. 

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. 

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives. 

From clue 14, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. 

From clue 11, the root beer lover does not live in the third house. 

Now, let's try to put all the clues together. 

House 1: tea drinker (clue 2), 
House 2: lilies (clue 5), 
House 3: ?, 
House 4: ?, 
House 5: tulips (clue 4). 

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who had pizza. The person who likes blue can't live in the fifth house, so the person who had pizza can't live in the fifth house. The person who likes blue can't live in the first house (tea drinker), so the person who had pizza can't live in the second house. The person who likes blue can't live in the second house (lilies), so the person who had pizza can't live in the third house. The person who likes blue can live in the third house, so the person who had pizza can live in the fourth house. 

House 1: tea drinker, 
House 2: lilies, 
House 3: blue, 
House 4: pizza, 
House 5: tulips. 

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other. From clue 13, the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who likes green. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red can't live in the first and second houses. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red can't live in the fourth and fifth houses. So, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live in the third and fourth houses or the second and third houses. 

From clue 14, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. The coffee drinker can't live in the fifth house, so the person who likes yellow can't live in the fifth house. The coffee drinker can't live in the fourth house, so the person who likes yellow can't live in the fourth house. The coffee drinker can live in the third house, so the person who likes yellow can live in the fourth house. 

House 1: tea drinker, 
House 2: lilies, 
House 3: blue, coffee drinker, red, 
House 4: pizza, yellow, 
House 5: tulips. 

From clue 13, the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who likes green. The person who likes green lives in the fourth house or the fifth house. The person who likes green can't live in the fourth house (yellow), so the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. 

House 1: tea drinker, 
House 2: lilies, 
House 3: blue, coffee drinker, red, 
House 4: pizza, yellow, 
House 5: tulips, green.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 12, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. And from clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the person in the first house has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti.

From clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player. And from clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player. So, the order is: baseball player, tennis player, soccer player.

From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. And from clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. 

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. And from clue 8, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. And from clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. And from clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house.

Considering all the clues, the order is: 
- House 1: tulips, spaghetti, bird keeper, sedan, baseball player
- House 2: lilies, stew, fish enthusiast, minivan, soccer player
- House 3: rose, fried rice, cat lover, convertible, tennis player
- House 4: daffodils, grilled cheese, horse owner, truck, golfer

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 1, the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck. 
From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives left of the person driving a truck. 
So, the person eating grapes and the person who likes yellow must be the same person, and they live in house 1.

Now, from clue 2, the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader. 
Since the person in house 1 likes yellow, the person in house 2 must like red. 
And since the person in house 1 is eating grapes, the person in house 2 must be eating oranges.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is eating grapes and likes yellow. 
The person in house 2 is eating oranges and likes red. 
The person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader, so the person in house 1 is wearing boots and the person in house 2 is the mystery book reader.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try my best to figure this out. 

From clue 9, the person who likes green lives in the third house. 

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. 

From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. 

From clue 13, the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader. 

So, the order is: minivan, romance book lover, mystery book reader. 

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader, the order is: minivan, romance book lover, green (mystery book reader can't be in the third house).

From clue 8, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

So, the order is: minivan, romance book lover, green, truck, ? 

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. 

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the percussionist can't live in the first house. So, the person who had pizza can't live in the first house either. 

From clue 9, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. 

From clue 4, there is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives. 

From clue 3, there are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives. 

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the fourth house. 

Considering all these clues, the person who had pizza can't live in the fourth house (because the golfer lives there), and can't live in the first house (because the person who ate spaghetti lives there). 

If the person who had pizza lives in the third house, then the percussionist would have to live in the second house (from clue 5), and the basketball player would have to live in the fourth house (from clue 9). But the golfer lives in the fourth house (from clue 2), so that can't be right. 

So, the person who had pizza must live in the second house."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 2 and 3, we know the violinist lives in the second house and so does the basketball player. That means the violinist and the basketball player are the same person.

Now, from clue 1, we know the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. That means the cricketer can't live in house 3, 'cause there ain't no house to the right of that one. And we already know the second house is taken by the violinist/basketball player. So the cricketer must live in house 1.

That leaves house 3 for the cellist. And since the violinist/basketball player lives in house 2, that means the soccer player must live in house 1, but we already said the cricketer lives in house 1. Wait, that can't be right.

I think I made a mistake. If the cricketer lives in house 1, and the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, that means the cellist lives in house 2 or 3. But we know the violinist/basketball player lives in house 2, so the cellist must live in house 3.

That means the cricketer lives in house 1, the violinist/basketball player lives in house 2, and the cellist lives in house 3. And that leaves the soccer player...

"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2 and 3, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house and is a mystery book reader.

From clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who likes white does not live in the third house, so the person who likes white must live in the first or second house.

From clue 9, the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red. If the person who likes red lives in the first house, then the tea drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker. If the tea drinker lives in the second house, then the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the coffee drinker must live in the third house. But we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, so this can't be right.

"From the clues, we know the coffee drinker lives in the 4th house (clue 2) and the flutist also lives in the 4th house (clue 3). Since the person who owns horses lives in the 4th house (clue 11), we can conclude that the coffee drinker, the flutist, and the horse owner are the same person.

Now, the person who likes milk does not live in the 3rd house (clue 1), and the guitarist does not live in the 3rd house (clue 5), and the violinist does not live in the 3rd house (clue 6). This means the percussionist must live in the 3rd house.

The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer (clue 7). Since the guitarist does not live in the 3rd house, the guitarist must live in the 4th house or the 2nd house is not possible for the guitarist. But the 4th house is already occupied by the flutist, so the guitarist must live in the 2nd house.

The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8). The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other (clue 10). The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (clue 9). 

Considering the above information, the only possible arrangement is:
- 1st house: basketball player, water drinker, cat lover (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player)
- 2nd house: tennis player, root beer lover, dog owner
- 3rd house: cricketer, milk drinker, fish enthusiast
- 4th house: golfer, coffee drinker, horse owner, flutist

So, the fish enthusiast lives in the 3rd house.

Answer: (D)"
"I think I can figger this out. 

So, the pianist lives in house 2. And the person with daffodils lives next to the pianist. That means the person with daffodils can't live in house 2, 'cause they gotta live next to the pianist, not in the same house. 

So, the person with daffodils must live in house 1, 'cause that's the only other house, and it's right next to house 2.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 2, the person eating oranges lives in the first house. 

From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, but from clue 4, the person eating a banana lives in the fourth house. So, the person eating a banana owns an SUV.

From clue 3, the person eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the order is: apples, daffodils, minivan.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. 

From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. We know the person eating oranges lives in the first house. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, but since the person eating oranges lives in the first house, the person eating apples must live in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan, so the order is: oranges, apples, daffodils, minivan. But we know the person eating a banana lives in the fourth house and owns an SUV, so the order is: oranges, apples, daffodils, SUV (banana), minivan.

Now, we have to fit the rest of the information into this order. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. The person who drives a convertible can't live in the first, second, or fourth house, so the person who drives a convertible must live in the fifth house. The person who has a vase of tulips can't live in the fifth house, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first, second, or third house. But the person eating oranges lives in the first house, and the person eating apples lives in the second house, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house.

Now, we have: oranges, apples, tulips, SUV (banana), convertible.

From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

"Let's think this through. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. So the history book buff must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television. So the person with the television must live in the second house. But we already know the history book buff lives in the second house. So the history book buff must have the television.

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. The mystery book reader lives in the first house, so the person with the phone must live in the first house. But we already know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. So the mystery book reader must have the phone.

Now we have the first house: mystery book reader with a phone.
The second house: history book buff with a television.

The only one left is the science fiction book fanatic with a computer. And the only house left is the third house.

So the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"I think the answer is (A) No. I've heard of St. Vitus's Dance, it's like a sickness that makes people move all jerky and stuff. I don't think that would be good for ballet, 'cause isn't ballet all about bein' smooth and pretty?"
(B) Yes
"I think I can answer that. I heard Ringo Starr is a vegetarian, so if that's true, he probably wouldn't eat the pot roast 'cause it's meat. So, my answer is (A) Yes."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I saw on TV that the Super Bowl has a huge crowd, and I remember learnin' that the 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, at the Olympiastadion. I think it held like 110,000 people back then, but I'm pretty sure it's not big enough for a Super Bowl crowd, 'cause I heard those games can have like 70,000 to over 80,000 people, but some stadiums can hold more, and the Olympics stadium in Berlin might not be able to fit that many people now, 'cause I think it's been renovated and stuff."
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
"I think I can answer that. Martin Luther, he's that guy who nailed them 95 theses to the door, right? If he did one a day, that's 365 theses in a year. He only had 95, so yeah, he'd run out way before half a year. I'd say the answer is (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
(B) No
(B) Yes
"I think it was... (A) Yes. I'm pretty sure Charlemagne's dad, Pepin the Short, he was the one who helped Charles Martel win that battle."
"I think it's (A) No. Nissan's headquarters is in Yokohama, Japan, but that don't mean everyone eats with chopsticks all the time, especially at work. I mean, they might have forks and knives and stuff too, like in a regular cafeteria."
(B) No
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) No
(A) Yes
"I think it's (A) No. I don't think Simon Cowell is a politician or has anything to do with the government. He's that guy from American Idol, right? I don't think he gets to decide who's a judge, especially not for something as big as the Supreme Court."
(A) No
(B) No
A: (A) Yes
"I think I can give it a shot. 

Alright, so Apollo, he's like a god from them Greek myths, right? He's got a lot of powers and stuff. And then there's D'Artagnan, he's that musketeer fella from the stories. 

Now, if we're talkin' about the Apollo from the myths, I reckon he could take down a bunch of D'Artagnans. I mean, Apollo's a god, and D'Artagnan's just a human, even if he is a good swordsman. Apollo's got all sorts of powers, like control over the sun and music and stuff. He could probably just blast D'Artagnan with a sunbeam or somethin' and be done with it.

But, if we're talkin' about the other famous Apollo, like the astronauts who went to the moon, I don't think they'd stand a chance against a bunch of D'Artagnans. I mean, they're just regular guys in space suits, and D'Artagnan's got a sword and knows how to use it. Unless the astronauts had some kinda special space swords or somethin', I think D'Artagnan would come out on top.

So, I guess the answer depends on which Apollo we're talkin' about. But if I had to choose, I'd say (B) Yes, the mythological Apollo could take down the D'Artagnans."
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know much about them fancy chess openings, but I think I've heard of the French Defence. From what I recall, it starts with the move 1... e6. Now, I'm not no expert, but I'm pretty sure that move can help prevent that four-move checkmate. So, I'd say... (A) Yes."
"I don't rightly know, but I think it's (B) No. My grandma always said that chlorine water's only good for a day or two, then it's not safe no more. She said the chlorine wears off and it's just like drinkin' regular water, but I think it's better to be safe than sorry. If it's been sittin' around for a week, I wouldn't drink it."
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard that dichromats, they got some trouble seein' colors, right? They can only see like, two colors or somethin'. And chlorine gas and neon gas, they're both gases, so they don't really have no color when they're just sittin' there. But I think I remember that chlorine gas is like, yellowish or greenish when it's in the air, and neon gas is like, reddish or orangish when it's lit up. But if you can't see all them colors, it's gonna be hard to tell 'em apart, ya know?"
"I think it's (A) Yes. I 'eard that Dido, Queen of Carthage was written by Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Nashe, and it was performed in 1586 or 1594, I think. Elizabeth I was the queen from 1558 to 1603, so she was still queen when the play was performed."
A: (A) Yes
"I don't rightly know. I mean, I ain't no expert on turtles or nothin', but I reckon they're probably doin' alright. I heard they're pretty solitary animals, so maybe they don't mind bein' alone so much. Plus, they got the ocean to swim around in, so that's somethin'. But I don't know for sure, I ain't never really thought about it before. I'd say... (B) Yes, but I'm just guessin'."
(B) No
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've heard of Old English, it's like from a long time ago, like in England and stuff. I don't think people in the Confederate states were talkin' like that before the Civil War. They were talkin' regular English, like we do now, but with a Southern accent and all."
(A) Yes
(A) No
(B) Yes
"I think I can answer that. Ryan Crouser is a shot putter, right? He's really strong and can throw heavy things far. A bengal fox is an animal, and it's not very big or heavy. But, I don't think it's a good idea to throw animals, and I'm pretty sure it's not allowed. Plus, animals can get hurt easily. So, even if Ryan Crouser could throw a bengal fox, I don't think he should. But if I had to choose, I'd say (A) Yes, he probably could throw it if he wanted to, but like I said, he shouldn't."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I remember that Lord Voldemort was a half-blood, his mom was a witch but his dad was a Muggle. And didn't he make a big deal about only pure-bloods being good enough? So, under his own rules, he wouldn't have been good enough for Hogwarts."
(B) Yes
"(A) Yeah, I think so. My grandma used to make pickles all the time, and she'd always say somethin' about the good bacteria helpin' 'em ferment. I think that's what lactobacillus is, right? The good stuff that makes 'em sour and crunchy."
"I don't rightly know what them robotics companies are, but I do know that the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was a big deal. It was like, a huge crash that hurt a lot of people's money. Now, I ain't no expert, but I think them robotics companies, if they existed back then, would've been hurt too. I mean, if everyone's losin' money, it's likely them companies would be losin' money too. So, I'd say... (B) Yes."
"I don't rightly know what Khanbaliq is, but I do know Moon Jae-in is from South Korea. He was born in Geoje, South Korea."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that people with Anorexia nervosa don't eat enough, so they don't get enough nutrients. That means their bones might not be as strong, right? And if their bones aren't strong, they're more likely to break 'em. Plus, I've seen people with Anorexia nervosa, they're really skinny and frail, so it makes sense that their bones would be weaker."
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard of sea shanties bein' sung by sailors on ships, but I don't think folks on the Oregon Trail would've been singin' 'em. They were more worried 'bout gettin' across the country by wagon, dealin' with rivers and mountains, and findin' food. Don't reckon they'd be singin' sea songs on land."
(A) Yes
(B) No
(A) No
(A) No
"I think I can answer that. I've lived near the ocean my whole life, and I've seen grey seals swimmin' around. Now, I ain't no expert, but I know Moby Dick is a whale, a sperm whale to be exact. And I've heard they live in the ocean too. So, I reckon a grey seal and a sperm whale could swim in the same water. They might not be friends or nothin', but they could be in the same ocean. So, my answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't rightly know what a Trek 9000 is, but I'm pretty sure it's a bike. If that's the case, I think the answer is (A) No. I mean, you can just lean it against somethin' or use a kickstand, right?"
(B) Yes
(B) No
A: (A) Yes
"I think hamsters don't live that long. They usually live like 2-3 years, right? Leap years happen every 4 years, so I don't think a hamster would live long enough to see two leap years."
"I don't know what Gryllidae is, but I do know Rahul Dravid is a famous cricketer from India. I think Gryllidae might be related to insects or something, so I'm gonna say (A) No."
(A) No
"I don't rightly know who William Franklyn-Miller is, but I do know he ain't a NASCAR driver."
"I don't rightly know who Jacques Duèze or Richard Dawkins are. Jacques Duèze sounds like some old-timey fella, and Richard Dawkins sounds like a smart guy. I think Jacques Duèze might be that Pope John XXII fella, but I ain't sure. If that's the case, I reckon they wouldn't have been friends 'cause one's a pope and the other's an atheist. So, I'd say (B) No."
(B) No
(B) No
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
"I don't rightly know what you're talkin' about. You're askin' about some fella who made Goofy, and his boss's brother doin' somethin' bad? I don't know nothin' about that. I think you might be talkin' about Walt Disney, but I don't know who his boss was or what his brother did. I'm just a simple fella, I don't know all that fancy stuff."
(A) Yes
"A: (A) Yeah, I think so. Paul Bunyan's a giant lumberjack, right? He's all about choppin' down trees and creatin' a big mess. I don't think he'd be too good at plannin' cities, 'cause he'd just wanna knock stuff down and build his own way. Cities need careful plannin' and thinkin' ahead, and I don't think Paul's style would fit in too well."
"(A) Yeah, that's normal. I've seen parsley in the produce section, but I've also seen it in the spice aisle, like in a dried-up form, and sometimes even in the fresh herb section near the meat counter."
"I think it's (A) No. I've seen pictures of Alcatraz, and it's a pretty small island. I don't think it's big enough to fit a whole football field."
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I mean, even if a Goblin shark had limbs, it's still a fish, right? It's used to livin' underwater, not on land. Its body's all wrong for ridin' a bike. It'd probably be too heavy, and its skin's all... slimy. Plus, it's got that funny-lookin' nose thingy. I just don't think it'd be able to balance or breathe or nothin' on a bike."
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
"I'd say (A) Yes. Artillery's them big guns that shoot cannons and stuff. A slingshot's just somethin' you make outta a piece of wood and some rubber, it's not the same thing."
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I think I can answer that. The Capricorn symbol is like a goat with a fish tail, right? I don't think it's got all the parts of a chimera, 'cause a chimera's got a lion's head, a goat's body, and a snake's tail. So, I'd say... (B) No."
(B) No
"I think they'd struggle. Iris is a messenger of the gods, but she's all about rainbows and stuff, not really about deliverin' packages. And Hermes, he's the messenger god, but he's got wings on his feet, so he's used to flyin' around, not drivin' a truck. Plus, he's always busy helpin' out the other gods, so I don't think he'd be too good at followin' a delivery schedule. So yeah, I think they'd both struggle at a UPS job."
(A) No
"I don't rightly know what them numbers mean, but I think I heard of pi bein' around 3.14 and square root of 5 bein' around 2.24. If that's right, then pi is bigger than square root of 5. So, I reckon the answer is:

(A) Yes"
A: (A) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard that lactic acid is somethin' that builds up in your muscles when you exercise real hard, like when I'm out workin' in the fields all day. It's like, your body's way of dealin' with all the hard work you're doin'. I don't think it's necessarily bad, just means you're gettin' a good workout in."
"I think it's (A) No. I remember learnin' about this in school, but I don't rightly recall all the details. I think the Gunpowder Plot was when some folks tried to blow up the English Parliament, but it didn't have nothin' to do with Mary, Queen of Scots. She was already dead by then, if I recall. Her son, James, was the king of England at the time, and the plotters were tryin' to kill him, not get rid of her bloodline."
"I don't rightly know what them Masonic Lodges are, but I think I can give it a go. From what I've heard, Masonic Lodges are like secret clubs for grown men. Now, Alice is just a little girl, so I reckon she wouldn't be allowed to join. 

My answer is (B) No."
"I ain't no expert, but I've heard from some folks who've had run-ins with both. They say a crocodile bite is way worse. See, crocodiles got them powerful jaws that can crush a car, and their teeth are like razors. They can snap a person in two. Bull sharks, on the other hand, are just really aggressive and got lots of sharp teeth, but they ain't as strong as a crocodile's bite. So, I reckon the answer is (B) No."
(A) No
A: (A) Yes
(A) Yes
(A) No
"I think I know this one. Bruce Lee, he was that famous martial artist guy, right? I don't know much about his school days, but I think I heard he didn't attend his graduation ceremony. So, my answer is (A) Yes."
A: (A) No
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I mean, I've never seen a kidney before, but I know it's a pretty small organ inside our body, and a quarter is pretty big. I don't think it would fit."
"I don't rightly know who Bruce Gandy is, but I think I've heard of Handel's Messiah. It's like, a big fancy music thingy, right? I don't know if Bruce Gandy is a singer or what, but if he's not a singer, that'd be kinda weird. But if he is a singer, I guess it depends on what kinda singer he is. Is he one of them fancy opera singers? If so, maybe he'd be okay for Messiah. But if he's like, a country singer or somethin', that'd be kinda weird. So, I'm gonna say... (A) Yes, unless he's one of them fancy singers."
(B) No
(B) No
(A) No
(B) No
I don't know who Sockington is.
(A) Yes
(B) No
(B) No
(B) Yes. A cattle farmer might be useful to a drum maker 'cause they could provide the hides for makin' the drumheads.
(B) No
(A) Yes
"I don't rightly know what the Swiss Guard is or what the Virginia General Assembly is, but I'm pretty sure they're two different things. The Swiss Guard sounds like some kinda army or somethin', and the Virginia General Assembly sounds like a bunch of politicians. I don't think they'd be the same people, so I'd say... (B) No."
"I don't rightly know what them placozoa are, but I think they're some kinda simple animal or somethin'. I don't think they got brains like us, so I reckon they can't get learnin' disabilities like we do. They just kinda... exist, I s'pose. So, I'd say (B) No."
(B) Yes
(B) No
"I think it's (A) No. I've heard that clerics, even if they're celibate, are usually respected in Somalia, and they follow Islamic law. I don't think being celibate would be a reason for stoning."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I heard he was in an accident and got hurt real bad, and he needed a lot of special care and machines to breathe and stuff. If he didn't have the money, I don't think he would've been able to afford all that."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I remember hearin' that when a president is elected unanimously, it's a big deal, and I think I heard that mail carriers get the day off on that president's birthday. But I'm not really sure, I don't know much about that stuff."
"I think it's (A) No. I've heard of dyslexia, it's when people have trouble readin' and stuff, but I don't think it's the same as bein' intellectually disabled. My cousin's kid has dyslexia, and he's real smart, just has trouble with readin' and writin'."
(B) Yes
"(B) Yes. I think it's 'cause it's colder in New York, especially in the winter. I mean, I've seen it snow there and stuff. Florida's usually warm, so I don't think you'd get hypothermia there as easy."
(B) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've heard that a strong password should be a mix of letters and numbers, and binary numbers are just numbers, right? And the alphabet is, well, letters. So if you mix 'em together, that should be good. Like, if I use a mix of 1s and 0s from binary and some letters from the alphabet, that should be hard to guess."
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know who Abdulqawi Yusuf is or what he does, but I think I heard he's a judge or somethin'. If that's the case, I reckon he might go to the Hague, 'cause that's where them international courts are, right? So, I'm gonna take a guess and say... (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen videos of explosions and they can be really powerful. Gunpowder is like super explosive stuff, so if it blows up, it's gonna make a big boom. I've heard that when things blow up, they can make shock waves that can break windows and stuff, and that's like, really fast. Faster than sound, right? So yeah, I think it would make a supersonic shock wave."
(B) Yes
(B) No
A: (A) Yes
(B) Yes
"(A) No 

Kami Rita is a Sherpa mountaineer who has climbed Mount Everest multiple times. Mount Emei, on the other hand, is a mountain in China with an elevation of 3,049 meters. Compared to Mount Everest, which is over 8,800 meters tall, Mount Emei is relatively small. Given Kami Rita's extensive mountaineering experience, climbing Mount Emei would likely be an easy task for him."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, Sudoku boxes usually got numbers 1 to 9 in 'em, right? And Roman numerals got symbols for them numbers: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX. So yeah, you could use Roman numerals instead of regular numbers in Sudoku."
"I'm a bit confused. Basel is a city in Switzerland, and Los Angeles is a city in the United States. They're in different parts of the world. If it's daytime in Los Angeles, it's probably daytime in Basel too, but I don't know for sure. I think it depends on the time difference and stuff. But I'm pretty sure it's not dark in Basel just because it's daytime in LA. So, I'd say... (A) No."
(A) No
(B) Yes
(B) No
(B) No
"I think it's (A) No. I don't recall hearin' about no cosmic rays in that story. It was more about them Martians and their big machines, right?"
(A) Yes
"I don't rightly know much about them religions, but I'm pretty sure none of 'em started in the 19th century. I mean, I've heard of Hinduism and Buddhism, and they're way older than that. They've been around for thousands of years, I think. So, I'd say... (B) No."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen white rice go bad if it's been sittin' around for too long, especially if it gets wet or somethin'. Sesame seeds seem to last a lot longer, like they can just sit there for ages and still be fine."
(B) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've heard of people gettin' all sorts of weird symptoms when they got cancer, and I think adrenaline's one of 'em. My cousin's friend had cancer, and she said she was always feelin' jittery and anxious, like she had too much energy. I don't know if it's the cancer itself or the meds they give 'em, but I think it's possible it's related to adrenaline."
(A) No
(B) Yes
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen them big ol' hard drives at my cousin's house, and they're like, a terabyte or more, and they fill up fast. 500GB don't seem like a lot to me, especially if you're talkin' about savin' 10 hours of them Netflix shows every day. Them shows are like, high quality and all, so they gotta take up a lot of space, right? I think you'd fill up that 500GB in no time."
"I think I can answer that. Jon Brower Minnoch was a really heavy fella, right? He weighed like, over 1400 pounds or somethin'. Voyager 2, on the other hand, was a space probe, and it weighed around 825 kg, which is like, 1800 pounds or so. Now, a chair, that's a pretty sturdy thing, but I reckon if Jon Brower Minnoch sat on it, it'd probably break. But Voyager 2, that's a big machine, and it's made of metal and stuff, so I think it's heavier than a chair. So, yeah, I think Jon Brower Minnoch would break a chair before Voyager 2's launch mass would. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen hedgehogs curl up in a ball when they're scared, and I reckon they'd do that if they felt threatened by any animal, even if it don't have a backbone. But I'm not really sure why they'd be scared of animals without a spinal cord, 'cause they're probably not very strong or nothin'. Maybe it's 'cause they're just weird-lookin' or somethin'."
(A) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen people signin' and it seems like they use their good hand, ya know, the one they write with. My cousin's friend is deaf and she's right-handed, so she signs with her right hand. I don't think it's the same if you're left-handed, though. I've seen left-handed people sign with their left hand."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I mean, I've never even heard of bromine wedding rings. Silicon rings, I've seen those before, they're like, made from the same stuff as sand and stuff, and they're pretty popular 'cause they're cheap and don't break easy. I don't know what bromine is, but it sounds weird, so I don't think it'd be good for a wedding ring."
(A) Yes
(B) No
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen pictures of them Smilodons, they're like giant saber-toothed cats, right? Their teeth are huge and sharp, like knives. Beavers, on the other hand, got big front teeth, but they're for gnawin' on wood and stuff, not for killin' prey. They're like chisels, not knives. So, I don't think a beaver's teeth could rival them of a Smilodon."
(B) Yes
(B) No
"I don't rightly know who Daniel LeFever is, but I do know Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana. I think he died from a gunshot wound, but I don't recall anyone named Daniel LeFever bein' involved. So, I'd say (B) No."
(A) No
(B) Yes
(B) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. I remember hearin' that Theodor Geisel, or Dr. Seuss, he liked to use a lot of green in his pictures. He drew all them crazy trees and stuff in green. Maybe that's why people liked his books so much."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know. I've heard some folks say that them ancient Egyptians had some stories that sound kinda like the ones about Jesus, but I ain't no expert. I mean, I've heard tell of this one fella, Horus, who was born of a virgin and had a bunch of other similarities to Jesus. But I don't know if that means one story was copied from the other or if it's just a coincidence. I reckon it's possible that the story of Jesus might've been inspired by some of them older myths, but I ain't got no proof. So, I'll just have to say... (A) Yes, maybe."
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard of Methuselah, he's that really old guy from the Bible, right? He lived like, 969 years or somethin'. But that was way before the Common Era, like, before Jesus was born. So, if we're talkin' about the Common Era, that's like, from Jesus' time on, then Methuselah wouldn't count, 'cause he was already dead by then."
"I think they can. I mean, they both speak different languages and all, but they can still use them fancy translation things or find someone who speaks both languages to help 'em talk. Plus, lots of people in Burundi and New Brunswick probably speak English or French, so they can use them languages to communicate. So, yeah, I'd say (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, they're just people doin' voices for cartoons, right? They're Americans, so they can have a piece of the flag if they want."
(B) No
(B) No
(B) Yes
"(B) No. I've seen deaf people at concerts, they feel the beat through the floor and watch the signer, they seem to be enjoying it."
(B) No
(A) No
(A) Yes
(A) No
"I think the answer is (A) No. 

The largest bone in the body is the femur, which is in the leg, and the smallest bone is the stapes, which is in the ear. If you get hit in the leg or the ear, it's not gonna be good for the rest of your body, especially the torso. If you get hit hard enough in the leg, you could fall and hurt your torso, and if you get hit in the ear, it could make you lose your balance and fall too. Plus, if you're getting hit that hard, it's likely the person hitting you could also hit your torso."
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. I saw this movie where King Kong was climbin' the Empire State Buildin', and that thing's way taller than the Eiffel Tower. I mean, I don't know the exact numbers, but it looked a lot higher."
(A) No
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know, but I think it's (A) No. Mercury's a planet, and I don't see how it'd help with detectin' no virus."
"I think Alec Baldwin has a bunch of kids, like 8 or something, and Clint Eastwood has a lot too, but I think it's like 8 for Alec and 8 for Clint, so they're tied, but Alec's wife is younger so maybe they'll have more, but I don't know for sure."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"A: (A) Yeah, I think so. I mean, I ain't no expert, but I've heard Karl Marx was like, a big deal for communism and stuff. And China's communist, right? So, it makes sense that he'd have some influence."
(A) Yes
"I think I can try to answer that. So, I know Michael Bloomberg is a rich guy, like a billionaire or something. And Micronesia is a country, right? I'm not really sure how much money they owe, but I know it's a lot.

I think Michael Bloomberg's net worth is like, over 70 billion dollars or something. And the debt of Micronesia... I don't know, let's say it's a few billion dollars. I'm not really sure, but I think it's less than 10 billion.

So, if Michael Bloomberg wanted to, I think he could probably fund the debt of Micronesia for a while, maybe even a decade. I mean, he's got a lot of money, and their debt is probably a lot less than what he's worth.

So, my answer is... (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard that keto diets are low-carb, and dosas are like, made from rice and lentils, right? That's a lot of carbs. So, I don't think someone on a keto diet would be able to eat dosa."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've seen pictures of Mount Fuji, and it's really, really tall. I don't know exactly how tall, but I think it's like, over 12,000 feet or something. The Sea of Japan is deep, but I don't think it's that deep. I mean, I've seen ships and stuff in the water, so it can't be that deep, right? So yeah, I think the top of Mount Fuji would stick out."
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
(B) No
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. If someone was born in 1996, that's a leap year, but that don't change how we count years. They'd be 1 in 1997, 2 in 1998, and so on. By 2000, they'd be 4 years old."
"I think you're talkin' about Kobe beef. That's a type of beef from Japan, right? A BLT is a sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Bacon is pork, not beef. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No."
"I think Clark Gable was married five times, and Richard Burton was married five times too, but twice to the same woman, Elizabeth Taylor. So, I reckon they're kinda tied, but if I had to choose, I'd say Clark Gable married more different women. So, my answer is (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
"(B) No 

I don't rightly know much about them fancy weather maps, but I do know that the Gulf of Mexico can get some bad storms, especially in the fall. I think that's 'cause of them hurricanes. They can pop up outta nowhere and cause a whole lotta trouble. If I'm not mistaken, hurricane season goes on till the end of November, so a Halloween cruise might be right in the middle of it. I wouldn't wanna be out on the water when one of them storms hits."
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I don't know much about ŽRK Kumanovo, but I think they might be a sports team, maybe handball? The Spice Girls were a music group, so I don't think they could compete against a sports team."
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard that cookin' carrots makes the vitamin A easier to get into your body. Raw carrots are hard to digest, so you don't get as much of the good stuff."
(A) No
(B) No
"I don't rightly know what Cyndi Lauper likes in her rice pudding. I mean, I know she's a singer and all, but I don't know her personal preferences. But I do know she's a vegan, so if she's gonna make rice pudding, she'd probably use a milk substitute. So, I'd say... (B) Yes."
"I don't rightly know about that. I've heard some folks say that olive oil can cure all sorts of things, but I ain't never heard of it bein' used for rabies. I think you should talk to a doctor or a vet about that, 'cause I don't wanna give you no bad advice. But if I had to guess, I'd say (B) No."
(A) No
(A) No
"I don't rightly know about them fancy science things, but I'm pretty sure onions ain't got nothin' to do with them thermonuclear bombs. I mean, onions make me cry when I chop 'em up, but I don't think they're gonna blow up the whole world. So, I'd say (A) No."
(B) No
(B) Yes
A) Yes
"I think I can give it a shot. I'm not exactly a numbers person, but I'll try my best. 

So, I looked up the population of Ashland, Oregon in 2018, and it's around 21,000 people. Now, I don't know much about the military, but I think a division is a pretty big unit, right? I've heard it's like, tens of thousands of people.

If that's the case, then 21,000 people might not be enough for a whole division. I mean, it's a decent-sized town, but it's not a huge city or anything. So, I'm gonna say... (B) Yes, the population of Ashland, Oregon in 2018 might be inadequate to be a hypothetical military division."
(B) Yes
A: (A) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"(B) Yes. If there weren't no loggers, that means there wouldn't be no trees gettin' cut down. And if there ain't no trees gettin' cut down, then there ain't no wood pulp to make toilet paper. So yeah, it'd be hard to get toilet paper."
"I think it's (B) No. Silverfish are pretty small and they don't exactly climb walls or buildings. They like dark, damp places and usually stick to the ground. I don't think they could climb all the way up the Empire State Building, it's way too tall for 'em."
"I reckon that's a mighty interesting question. I ain't no expert, but I've seen armadillos before. They got that hard shell on 'em, and it's pretty tough. Now, I ain't sayin' it's bulletproof or nothin', but it's definitely hard enough to stop some things.

So, if someone was to use an armadillo as a shield, it might just work. I mean, it's better than nothin', right? It's like usin' a big ol' turtle shell or somethin'. Just gotta make sure you're holdin' onto it tight, 'cause them armadillos can roll up into a ball and you don't wanna get squished.

So, I reckon the answer is... (A) Yes."
(B) Yes
(B) No
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen pictures of sloths on the ground and they don't just explode. They can move around on the ground, but they're really slow. I think they just like bein' upside down 'cause it's comfy for 'em or somethin'."
(B) No
"I don't rightly know much about them leopard seals or Sea World, but I've heard some folks say that keepin' wild animals in captivity can be bad for 'em. I think I'd have to say (B) Yes, just 'cause it don't seem right to keep 'em locked up like that."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I don't rightly know. I don't know much about Felicity Huffman or Mike DeWine. Is Felicity Huffman that actress lady? And Mike DeWine, is he a politician or somethin'? I don't know their politics, so I couldn't say for sure."
(B) No
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know about them European wildcats, but I do know black-tailed jackrabbits are from North America, and European wildcats are from, well, Europe. So, I reckon they wouldn't even meet in the wild. I'd say (B) No."
(B) Yes
"(A) Yeah, I think so. I've heard some folks say that. I don't rightly know all the details, but I think it's 'cause of how the Native Americans were treated back when the Pilgrims first came over. Some people don't think it's right to celebrate that, so they call it a day of mourning instead."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I remember learnin' that England used to control some of that area, like Palestine, after World War I. They had a mandate over it from the League of Nations. That's why there's still some connection between England and what's goin' on in Israel and the Arab countries."
(B) No
(B) Yes
"I think I know this one. Tony Bennett's full name is Anthony Dominick Benedetto. I remember hearin' that Dominick Cruz, a former UFC champion, shares that middle name. So, my answer is (B) Yes."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've heard that in the Kingdom of Hungary, the nobles and land owners had a lot of power and they got to choose their king. It was like, they would all get together and decide who would be the ruler."
(B) Yes
(B) No
(A) No
(B) No
"I think it's (B) No. I'm pretty sure the Eighth Amendment is about cruel and unusual punishment, not freedom of speech. I think that's the First Amendment that protects freedom of speech."
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, a triples tandem bike is for three people, but it's still just a bike, right? Apollo 15 was a space mission, and those astronauts were in space suits and all that. I don't think a bike, even a triples one, would work in space. Plus, wouldn't they need oxygen and stuff?"
(A) Yes
"I don't rightly know. I think there was somethin' goin' on with the virus, and a lot of places were closed. I'm pretty sure sports stadiums were closed too. So, I'd say (A) No."
(B) No
A: (A) Yes
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know what you're talkin' 'bout with this armadillo armor business, but I do know that Franz Ferdinand was shot, not hit by somethin' that armadillo armor would protect against. He was shot by Gavrilo Princip in 1914, and them bullets woulda gone right through any armor made from armadillo shells. So, I reckon the answer is (A) No."
(A) No
"I think I know this one. Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat, right? And before him was William Howard Taft, who was a Republican. Then after Wilson, it was Warren G. Harding, who was also a Republican. So yeah, Wilson was sandwiched between two Republicans. 

Answer: (A) Yes"
"I think I can answer that. I've heard of all three, but I don't know much about 'em. Statue of Unity is that big statue in India, right? And Statue of Liberty is that famous one in America. Lighthouse of Alexandria is that old tower thingy in Egypt.

From what I know, Statue of Unity and Statue of Liberty are both statues, so they're kinda similar. They're both big and famous, but in different countries. Lighthouse of Alexandria, on the other hand, is a lighthouse, not a statue. It's like a tower that helps guide ships.

So, if I had to choose, I'd say... (B) Yes. Statue of Unity is more like Statue of Liberty than Lighthouse of Alexandria."
"I don't rightly know what that Abitur thing is, but I do know Moon Jae-in is a South Korean fella who used to be president. I think he's from South Korea, so I'm gonna take a guess and say... (B) No."
(A) Yes
(B) Yes
(A) No
(A) Yes
"I don't rightly know about them Imams or Jesus's disciples. I think Imams are from Islam and Jesus's disciples are from Christianity. I've heard of 12 disciples of Jesus, but I don't know how many Imams there are. I've heard of a few, like Imam Reza, but I don't know the total number. I'm gonna take a guess and say... (B) No."
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I don't rightly know who Julio Gonzalez is or what acetylene is, so I couldn't say."
I don't rightly know what you're talkin' 'bout. What's the Borgia's World of Wonders and Release Therapy? Are they movies or somethin'? How long are they? I don't know how to answer that question.
"I think I can try to figger this out. I don't rightly know how many people were unemployed back then, but I think it was a whole lotta folks. I also don't know how big Tiger Stadium is, but I think it's pretty big. 

I think I remember hearin' that there were like 15 million people outta work back then. And I think Tiger Stadium holds like 80,000 people or somethin'. If that's right, then you could fit all them people in the stadium, but you'd have to have like 187 more stadiums just like it. So, I reckon the answer is... (A) No."
(A) Yes
(B) No
"I think the answer is (B) No. I mean, I've seen pictures of the Obama family, and they got kids and all. The 2020 Jaguar F-Type is a sports car, and it's pretty small. I don't think it's got enough room for the whole family to ride comfortably. It's more like a two-seater, right?"
"I don't rightly know what World of Warcraft is, but I think it might be one of them video games. If that's the case, it's probably just a bunch of computer stuff, so it don't have a weight. A loaf of bread, on the other hand, is somethin' you can hold in your hands, so it's got weight. So, I reckon the answer is (B) No."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that rhinos been around for a pretty long time, like, millions and millions of years. I'm not really sure about mongooses, but I think they came later. My friend's dad is a hunter and he told me that mongooses are pretty common in some parts of the world, but he didn't say they were as old as rhinos."
A: (A) No
(B) Yes
"I think I know this one. Jennifer Lawrence's middle name is Shrader, and I think I heard of a Martin Scorsese collaborator named Paul Schrader. They sound kinda similar, so I'm gonna say... (A) Yes."
A) Yes
(A) No
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. I've heard that Christians believe in goin' to heaven or hell after they die, not Sheol. Sheol's more like somethin' from the Old Testament, right? I don't think it's part of Christian beliefs no more."
"I think I know this one. I'm pretty sure Lil Jon's big hit was ""Turn Down for What""... no, wait, that's not it. I think it was ""Get Low"". And wasn't that with... (thinking) ...Ying Yang Twins? No, that's not it either. I remember now, it was ""Get Low"" with... (thinking) ...Ludacris and... (thinking) ...Ying Yang Twins. But I think I'm wrong about the other one I was thinking of... (thinking) ...Oh yeah, I got it. ""Get Low"" wasn't his only big hit. I think his other big hit was ""Turn Down for What""... no, that's not it. I think it was ""Get Low"" and... (thinking) ...

"I don't rightly know what Dorton Arena is or how big it is, but I do know 30th Street Station in Philly is a mighty busy place. I've been there a few times, and it's always packed with people. I think it's one of the busiest train stations in the country. 

I'm gonna take a guess and say no, all them people wouldn't fit in Dorton Arena. I mean, I don't know how big this arena is, but I'm pretty sure it's not big enough to hold all them people."
(B) No

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen pictures of them old ships, and they're big, but not that big. The Statue of Liberty is huge, right? I don't think any of them old ships could carry somethin' that heavy. Plus, I think the Statue of Liberty is like, made of copper and stuff, so it's gotta be super heavy. I just don't think it's possible."
"I don't rightly know what you're talkin' 'bout. I ain't never heard of no Adamu's tribe or nothin' like that. I don't know nothin' 'bout no Holy Land neither. I'm just a simple fella, I don't know much 'bout history or them fancy book learnin' things.

But if I had to guess, I'd say... (B) No. I mean, I don't know who Adamu is or what tribe he's from, so I don't see how the Holy Land could belong to him. But like I said, I don't know nothin' 'bout it, so I could be wrong."

"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, I don't rightly know what Cerebral palsy is, but I've heard it's somethin' that can happen to anyone, even little kids. So, I reckon a young Scarecrow, if he was a real person, could've gotten it too. But I ain't no doctor, so don't go quotin' me on that."
"I think I 'eard of that Pope Alexander VI fella. He was a Borgia, right? They was a pretty shady family, if ya know what I mean. Anyway, I think I recall that one of 'is kids, or maybe a grandkid, was a saint or somethin'. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Saint Francis Borgia.

A sofer is a Jewish scribe who writes Torah scrolls and other sacred texts by hand. Traditionally, a sofer uses a quill made from a bird's feather, usually a goose quill, and ink that is often made from animal products.

"I don't rightly know much about them fancy birds, but I do know they can live a long time. I think I heard tell of some cockatoos livin' up to 60 years or more in captivity. Now, I ain't no expert, but I looked up this Thirty Years' War, and it says it lasted from 1618 to 1648. That's 30 years, like the name says. 

If a white cockatoo can live up to 60 years, and we're talkin' 'bout a 30-year war, I reckon it's possible for one of them birds to have lived through the whole thing, provided it was born before the war started and lived a good long life. So, I'd say... (A) Yes."

"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, I've seen a lot of Harry Potter movies and they all did really well. My friend's kid loves 'em. They made a bunch of 'em, like 8 or something. And they made a lot of money from the books and toys and stuff too. The Matrix was good and all, but it was just 3 movies, right? And I don't think they made as much from toys and stuff."
(B) No
(A) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen them ballets on TV, and they can go on for hours. My cousin's friend had open heart surgery, and it took like 4-6 hours. But I think the ballet's like 3 hours long, with breaks in between. So yeah, the surgery might be done before the ballet's over."
(B) No
(A) No
"I don't rightly know what you're talkin' about. Who's Lhamo Thondup? I think I've heard of the Dalai Lama, is that who you mean? I don't know much about the Catholic Church or how they decide who's a saint. I don't think the Dalai Lama is Catholic, though. He's a Buddhist, ain't he? So, I reckon the answer would be (A) No."

(B) Yes
(B) No
(B) Yes
"I think the answer is (A) No. I've heard that back in the 80s, China had a one-child policy, which meant most families were only allowed to have one kid. Having more than one child was not allowed, and Pi is like, 3.14, so that's way more than one."
(A) No
"I think sables are pretty small, like weasels and stuff. They don't weigh that much, do they? I mean, I've seen 'em, they're like little furry things. I don't think they'd be good for weighin' down a scale, 'cause they just ain't heavy enough. So, I'd say... (B) No."

"I think it's (B) Yes. I remember hearin' about the Great Recession, and it was a real tough time for a lot of people. I had friends who lost their jobs, and it was hard for 'em to find new ones. I think it was around 2007 to 2009, and it was like, the worst time for jobs in a long time."
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know much about them fancy history things, but I think I heard tell that Japanese serfs, they were called ""shoen"" or somethin', had it a mite better than them English serfs. See, in Japan, they had more rights and could even own some land, whereas in England, they were pretty much stuck to the land and had to do what the lord said. So, I reckon the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States. I don't rightly know what Elagabalus's Emperor number is, but I do know he was a Roman Emperor. I looked it up and Elagabalus was the 25th Emperor of Rome, but his number is based on the list of Roman Emperors, and Andrew Johnson's number is based on the list of US Presidents."
(B) Yes
(B) No
(A) No
"I don't rightly know. I've heard of people with that condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder, but I ain't no expert. From what I've seen on TV and stuff, it seems like they might have some trouble rememberin' things, 'cause of all the different personalities and whatnot. So, I'd say... (B) No."

Now, I remember hearin' that Manuel I was married to Maria of Aragon, and she was the sister of Catherine of Aragon, who was married to Henry VIII of England, who was a Tudor.  So, that means Manuel I was like a brother-in-law to Henry VIII.  So, I'd say the answer is (B) Yes."
"I think I can answer that. Johnny Carson had three kids, but I don't know if that's enough for a water polo team. I think a water polo team has 7 players in the water at a time, and some extra players on the bench. So, I'd say... (B) No."
(B) Yes
(A) No
(B) No
"I think I can answer that. I don't know much about Iran, but I know Sugar Ray Robinson was a boxer. If he stole in Iran, I think he might get in trouble, but I don't think that would stop him from boxin'. So, my answer is (B) Yes."
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, cheetahs are fast and all, but Big Show is huge. I've seen him on TV, he's like a giant. I don't think a cheetah, no matter how fast it runs, can knock him down. Cheetahs are like 100 pounds or something, and Big Show is like 500 pounds. That's just too much for a little cat to handle."
(B) Yes
(A) No
"I don't rightly know. I mean, I've seen frogs eat some pretty weird stuff, like bugs and worms. They don't seem to care what they eat, so I reckon they don't feel disgust like we do. So, I'd say (A) No."

(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know much about them old battles, but I do know the Battle of Actium was a long time ago, like in 31 BC. And the Brazilian Navy, well, they didn't even exist back then, Brazil wasn't even a country. But if we're talkin' about if they could've turned the tide if they were there, I reckon it's a mighty big if.

From what I've heard, the Battle of Actium was fought with old ships and sails, and the Brazilian Navy nowadays has all sorts of fancy modern ships and tech. So, if we're talkin' about a modern Brazilian Navy showin' up in ancient times, I reckon they'd have a mighty big advantage. They'd have better ships, better guns, and all sorts of other fancy stuff that the ancient folks wouldn't know how to deal with.

So, I reckon the answer would be (B) Yes, a modern Brazilian Navy could've turned the tide of the Battle of Actium, but it's all just speculation, and it's a mighty big what-if."
(A) No
"I think I know this one.  I'm pretty sure it's (A) Yes. I remember somethin' about a teacher from Durmstrang, and it was that guy, Karkaroff, but then there was also somethin' about a Death Eater, and I think it was... (A) Yes, I'm pretty sure it was Karkaroff, but then also, there was somethin' about... (A) Yes, I'm pretty sure it was...  (A) Yes, I'm pretty sure it was...  Victor Krum's friend's teacher, Karkaroff, was a Death Eater, and that's the same thing as bein' associated with Lord Voldemort."

7. Alice and Bob swap gifts: Alice now has the red present, and Bob has the brown present.

So, at the end of the event, Claire has the black ball."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

Gertrude and Alice switch partners first. So Gertrude is now with Melissa, and Alice is with Ophelia.

Then Dave and Claire switch partners. So Dave is now with Jamie, and Claire is with Izzi.

Then Bob and Claire switch partners. So Bob is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Sam.

Then Gertrude and Eve switch partners. So Gertrude is now with Lola, and Eve is with Melissa.

Then Claire and Fred switch partners. So Claire is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Sam.

Then Fred and Alice switch partners. So Fred is now with Ophelia, and Alice is with Sam.

Then Gertrude and Dave switch partners. So Gertrude is now with Jamie, and Dave is with Lola.

Now, let's look at Eve. We already know Eve is with Melissa."
"Let's go through the swaps step by step:

1. Fred and Gertrude swap gifts: Fred now has the purple present, and Gertrude has the yellow present.
2. Fred and Eve swap gifts: Fred now has the black ball, and Eve has the purple present.

6. Bob and Dave swap balls: Bob now has the brown ball, and Dave has the blue ball.
7. Gertrude and Bob swap balls: Gertrude now has the brown ball, and Bob has the yellow ball.

Now, let's look at what Claire has. Claire has the blue ball.

The answer is (B) blue ball."
"I don't rightly know how to keep track of all these dancers and their partners, but I'll give it a shot.

At the start, Alice is dancing with Izzi. Then Eve and Claire switch partners, but that don't affect Alice. Then Fred and Gertrude switch partners, still don't affect Alice. Then Eve and Bob switch partners, still don't affect Alice. Then Eve and Alice switch partners, so now Alice is dancing with Patrick. Then Dave and Bob switch partners, don't affect Alice. Then Dave and Eve switch partners, don't affect Alice. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners, so now Alice is dancing with... whoever Dave was dancing with. 

Let me think... Dave was dancing with Rodrigo at the start, but then he switched with Bob, so he was dancing with Jamie. Then he switched with Eve, so he was dancing with... whoever Eve was dancing with. Eve was dancing with Patrick, but then she switched with Bob, so she was dancing with Jamie. Then she switched with Alice, so she was dancing with Patrick. Then she switched with Dave, so she was dancing with Jamie, and Dave was dancing with Patrick. Then Alice and Dave switched partners, so now Alice is dancing with... Patrick.

So, the answer is (C) Patrick."
"Let's go through this step by step. 

At the start, Fred is dancing with Lola. 

First, Dave and Bob switch partners. This doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Still doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Still doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners. Still doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Then, Claire and Dave switch partners. Still doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners. Still doesn't affect Fred, so he's still with Lola.

Finally, Bob and Fred switch partners. Now Fred is dancing with Bob's partner. We need to figure out who Bob's partner is. 

Let's go back to the start and see who Bob's partner was. Bob was dancing with Sam. Then Dave and Bob switched partners, so Bob was dancing with Rodrigo. Then Claire and Bob switched partners, so Bob was dancing with Izzi. Then Eve and Bob switched partners, so Bob was dancing with Karl. Then Gertrude and Bob switched partners, so Bob was dancing with Patrick.

So, when Bob and Fred switch partners, Fred is dancing with Patrick."
"Let's go through the swaps one by one.

6. Alice and Dave swap gifts: Alice had brown, Dave had yellow. Now Alice has yellow, Dave has brown.

7. Claire and Eve swap gifts: Claire had purple, Eve had green. Now Claire has green, Eve has purple.

At the end, Gertrude has the pink ball."
"Let's try to keep track of the partners. 

Claire starts with Jamie. Then Bob and Claire switch partners, so Claire is now with Sam. 

Then Fred and Alice switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. 

Then Bob and Dave switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire either. 

Then Alice and Bob switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. 

Then Alice and Eve switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. 

Then Alice and Dave switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. 

Finally, Gertrude and Eve switch partners, but that doesn't affect Claire either. 

So Claire is still with Sam."

6. Claire and Fred swap gifts: Claire now has the yellow present, and Fred has the orange ball.
7. Alice and Eve swap gifts: Alice now has the red present, and Eve has the white present.

Now, let's look at what Bob has. He swapped his yellow present with Fred's purple present in step 3. So, Bob has the purple present.

The correct answer is (G) purple present."
