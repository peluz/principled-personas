"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount of money she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
  \]

Next, add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:
\[
2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total amount he spent (the purchase price plus the repairs):
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, each day he runs a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters. Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

The final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal. She has a flock of 20 chickens.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. Since each chicken gets 3 cups, the number of chickens fed in the morning is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ cups per chicken}} = 5 \text{ chickens} \]

In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. The number of chickens fed in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ cups per chicken}} = 8.33 \text{ chickens} \]
Since the number of chickens must be a whole number, and typically in such problems, fractional chickens are not considered, we assume she feeds 8 chickens in the afternoon and has 2 chickens left over, or she feeds 8 chickens and has 1 chicken with less than 3 cups (which is not possible in this context, so we assume she feeds 8 chickens).

So, the total number of chickens fed in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ chickens} \]

Since Wendi has a total of 20 chickens, the number of chickens left for the final meal is:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \text{ chickens} \]

Each of these 7 chickens gets 3 cups of feed, so the total amount of feed for the final meal is:
\[ 7 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 21 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair up the glasses:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

4. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60% download: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 + 60 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he already spent 3.5 hours (3 hours + 0.5 hours), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \]

The distance covered during the last 0.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 235 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = \text{Downloads in the first month} + \text{Downloads in the second month} + \text{Downloads in the third month}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance have been accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

125"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, she will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Given that the average speed Marissa wants is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Solving for Total Time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another 1 hour on the next 2 miles. Therefore, the time she has already spent is:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

To find out how much time she has left, we subtract the time already spent from the total time:

\[
3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Now, we need to determine the speed required to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time. The remaining distance is:

\[
12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Marissa has 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles. Therefore, her required speed for the remaining distance is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink remaining is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[
\text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to sum up the DVDs bought by each group of customers.

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total decrease in length.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total decrease in length over 4 hours is:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He first stopped after traveling 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he traveled \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles before his second stop. Therefore, the distance he traveled between his first and second stops is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
- The first guess is 80.
- The second guess is 60.
- The third guess is 100.

The sum of the guesses is \(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\).

The average guess is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of guesses, which is 3:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
80

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, calculate the total time John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, we multiply the time spent on one dog by the number of dogs:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on all the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily hours by 7:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
\[
35 \text{ hours/week}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scored is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:

\[
\frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:

\[
2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry to buy 2 yogurts each day is:

\[
2.50 \times 30 = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can verify that the remaining $5 is indeed the difference between the money he made from selling the lego sets and the money he spent on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we know that on the first day, he runs 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half as much as he does on the first day. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Servings you can eat} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500g (because 300g is 5 servings), the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ \text{Grams you can eat} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:
  \[
  5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
  \]
- Total hours spent writing articles:
  \[
  26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
  \]

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package and subtract the 23 she had left.

The total number of post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the number of post-it notes she used plus the number she had left:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Since she originally had 80 post-it notes and ended up with 243 post-it notes after purchasing the new package, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen and he sells them for $2 per dozen, we can calculate the daily revenue from eggs as follows:

\[ \text{Daily revenue} = \frac{\text{Number of eggs per day}}{\text{Eggs per dozen}} \times \text{Price per dozen} \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = \frac{252}{12} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 42 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = \text{Daily revenue} \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = 42 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = 294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, we first need to know the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Since the problem does not specify the distance, let's assume the distance to the destination is \(D\) miles.

Given:
- Speed from 1 to 4 PM: 10 miles per hour
- Speed on the return trip: 6 miles per hour

The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{out}} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

The time taken to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not specify the distance \(D\), we cannot determine the exact numerical value for the return trip time without additional information. However, if we assume the distance \(D\) is known, the return trip time can be calculated using the formula above.

If we assume the distance \(D\) is the same for both trips, the return trip time would be:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{D}{6} \]

Since the problem does not provide the distance \(D\), we cannot provide a numerical answer. The return trip time in terms of \(D\) is:
\[ \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined without the distance \(D\)."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the maximum additional weight the bridge can support.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

First, we find the maximum additional weight the bridge can support:
\[ \text{Maximum additional weight} = \text{Bridge's weight limit} - \text{Weight of the driver and the empty truck} \]
\[ \text{Maximum additional weight} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine how many boxes can be added to the truck:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Maximum additional weight}}{\text{Weight of each box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the additional fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original total of $40.00.
2. Add the 25% delivery fee to the original total.
3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee.
4. Add the $4.00 tip.

First, calculate the 25% delivery fee on the original total:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

Now, add the 25% delivery fee to the original total:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Next, add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 1
- Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Number of sour oranges = 2

Now, let's calculate the number of good oranges. We know that the good oranges are the total number of oranges minus the bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges + Number of sour oranges)
Number of good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Number of good oranges = 25 - 8
Number of good oranges = 17

So, the final numerical answer is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the jeweler is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost of the brooch. We find 10% of $1300 by multiplying $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of the brooch to find the final amount Janet paid:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children:

\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 225 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we add the number of pets each has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how long it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the information, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his new diet. To find out how much faster Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we calculate 10% of his original time:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Subtracting this improvement from his original time gives us Gerald's new time:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know that there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given that there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
   - First, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
     \[
     \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
     \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we calculate:

Next, we find the difference in the number of hours Harry slept compared to James:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges tomorrow. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the rings from each friend:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} = 175

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday are:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{115}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The price per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

To find the total cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost before cashback:

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's determine the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ 6 \times \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold)} = 1800 \]

Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 300 = B + 50B \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 300 = 51B \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{300}{51} = \frac{100}{17} \approx 5.88 \]

Since the number of birds must be a whole number, and given the context of the problem, we can conclude that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 5 (as it is the closest whole number that fits the context of the problem).

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber:
- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 = 42 \]

So, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is 42 hours."
"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After running for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, Rosie has 4 hours left to run at 5 miles per hour. Now, let's calculate the distance she can run in the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which means she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

This means that out of the 60 letters needing stamps, 20 have been stamped, leaving 40 letters still needing stamps.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and we know that 20 of these were already stamped by Jennie, the remaining letters in the pile of already-stamped letters must have been there before Jennie began her work.

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

The final numerical answer is 10."
"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

1. Julia originally had \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought and gave her 5 more spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After these actions, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Three times the cost of a pepper.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: 5 less than the cost of a watermelon.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day = 500 people * 0.4 hours/person = 200 hours.

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the total revenue from patients minus the total revenue from doctors:
- Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total revenue from doctors = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit after children vomit on them, which means \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Wednesday is:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (total from Monday to Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday and Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

"First, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so we calculate:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know Brian has 15 video games. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of video games Bobby has} = 3 \times (\text{Number of video games Brian has}) - 5 \]

Substituting the number of video games Brian has (15) into the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Number of video games Bobby has} = 3 \times 15 - 5 \]

First, we calculate \(3 \times 15\):

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from 45:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal gives:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, we need to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70

"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), then \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- Number of baby bees \( B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).
- Number of worker bees \( W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is $15, and there is no tax on food items. Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

Total cost = Cost of nonfood items + Cost of food items = $16.50 + $15 = $31.50

The final numerical answer is $31.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to calculate the number of bees that are in the hive at the end of the first 6 hours, before the last 6 hours. Initially, there are no bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave, there are 0 bees in the hive. Then, 15 bees return, so there are 15 bees in the hive. Finally, 60 bees return, so there are 15 + 60 = 75 bees in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, all 30 bees that left will return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

"First, we need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires that were inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so the total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.

Next, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.

Finally, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
- Total tires = bicycle tires + tricycle tires + unicycle tires
- Total tires = \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find out how much she made, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire:
- Total earnings = \(20 \times 25\) cents
- Total earnings = \(500\) cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total earnings to dollars:
- Total earnings = \(\frac{500}{100} = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. Since the final answer is required in feet, we will convert the lengths of the croissants and baguettes from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Next, we calculate the total length of each type of baked good if they are all laid end to end:

- The total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- The total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- The total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Now, we sum these lengths to find the total length of all the baked goods laid end to end:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when laid end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"

\[ \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34 \]

So, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \$34 \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the calculation is:

11 + 6 - 2 = 15

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can generalize the price after 36 months as follows:

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1 + \frac{20}{100})^{18}
\]

Calculating the exponent:

\[
(1 + \frac{20}{100})^{18} = 1.2^{18}
\]

Using a calculator to find \(1.2^{18}\):

\[
1.2^{18} \approx 10.51
\]

Now, multiply by the initial price:

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.51 = 210.2
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{210.2}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the amount of missed income Jackie would incur if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the amount of money Jackie will have more if she hires the accountant is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

The final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
   - Each flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs.
   - Each babysitting session provides 9 eggs.
   - To find the number of babysitting sessions required, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs provided per babysitting session: \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \).

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation \( S = 2B \):

\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants together:

\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

\[
\boxed{150}

"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:

"First, let's establish the ages based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, we need to calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than the minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment for student loans = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than the minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment for credit card = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than the minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment for mortgage = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, we add up the monthly payments for all debts:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is $18000."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they sold in total to make a $25 profit. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they sold. The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$10x \]

The cost to make \( x \) gallons is the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]
Thus, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$5x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Given that the profit is $25, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is $350."

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old two years ago.

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 years old two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the faster team and the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, so the profit can be expressed as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of these expenses:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:

- Total cost of rides = 2 rides * $33/ride = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:

- Total amount spent = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by 3:

- Amount each person paid = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We do this by multiplying the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is 5 pounds. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die**
Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees increases by 8 trees each year.
Total increase in trees over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

**Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years**
Number of trees left = Total number of trees after 10 years - Number of trees that die.
Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors paint these 6 pink flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos.

3. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

4. **At noon on Sunday:**
   - The number of white flamingos is 6.
   - The number of pink flamingos is 30.
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives the total amount Mark earns in a week:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Thus, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise. His original salary is $2000 per week. A 5% raise on $2000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Additionally, he receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, his total earnings for the year, including the reward, are:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score Needed on Sixth Test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:

\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, so the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:

\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, since that's the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month.

The total amount paid over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their ages in three years. Finally, we will calculate the average age of the three in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \( 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \).

The final numerical answer is 70."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there were 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers planted by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000.

The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's amount, which is \(\frac{15000}{3} = 5000\).

Adding the amounts from both years gives us the total amount spent:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos = $30 * 3 = $90

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The travel time for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester and back) is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.
   - Total travel time = travel by bus + travel by car (to Rochester) + travel by car (back to New Jersey)
   - Total travel time = 6 days + 3 days + 3 days = 12 days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for the upgrade:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Initially, there are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump into the ocean to swim, which means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go swimming. Another one-third go into the cave to eat their dinner, which also means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go into the cave.

So, the total number of penguins that leave for the ocean and the cave is \( 12 + 12 = 24 \).

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \( 36 - 24 = 12 \).

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve and his girlfriend together eat:

\[ \text{Total weekly consumption} = (6 + 3) \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of one vine:

"First, let's determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given:

1. Jessa is 20 years old.
2. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She requires makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time, so in one week she works:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works for the movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, the number of boys in the third class is:

The final numerical answer is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27
   - Total animals killed: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73

The final numerical answer is 73."

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = \text{Anne's rides} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 21 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight of the tree as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.
- Each book costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the books is \( 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Next, add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, add the cost of the books to the flat fee:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Flat fee
- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

\[
\boxed{6.00}

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( A \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( B_A = \frac{1}{2} J_b \), where \( B_A \) is the number of bananas Andrea has.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has using the first piece of information:
\[ A = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the fourth piece of information:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the third piece of information:
\[ B_A = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ B_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ B_A = 24 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A + B_A + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the 9,300 pennies.

First, calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[
\text{Number of pennies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount for 6,200 pennies is:
\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

So, the final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the sleeves is:
\[ \text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 765 \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by defining their current ages as \( M \) and \( C \) respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be written as:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

\[ M + C + 10 + 10 = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 40 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can check the conditions of the problem:
- If Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old.
- In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old.
- Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, which satisfies the second condition of the problem.

Thus, the final answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Calculate the remaining length for sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = Remaining length / Length per bead = 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

The total amount of money Kelly has is the sum of the value of the quarters and the dimes:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ stars/row} = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ stars/row} = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. Add the stars from the rows with 8 and 6 stars:
   \[
   24 \text{ stars} + 12 \text{ stars} = 36 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. Subtract the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the rows with 5 stars:
   \[
   76 \text{ stars} - 36 \text{ stars} = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

5. Determine the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the number of 5-star rows by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows}
   \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the slow lane car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals for Ali and Izzy} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals for Ali and Izzy} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \text{ dollars per minute}
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 150 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars per minute} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:

Total count of activities = Total pushups + Total squats + Total dumbbell presses
Total count of activities = 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

\[ \text{Daily consumption per person} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption for 5 people} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money she bid, considering that she bid after each of the 3 other people and the bids increased by $50 each time.

1. The first person's bid is $200.
2. Carmen's first bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second person's bid is $250.
4. Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
5. The third person's bid is $300.
6. Carmen's third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- First bid: $250
- Second bid: $300
- Third bid: $350

Total amount Carmen paid = $250 + $300 + $350 = $900.

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: The pages are printed in a specific order: page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages, one on each side of the fold.

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper prints 2 pages.
- Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April, given that the company performed very well for the whole month, is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he competed against 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent events, we can simply add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs.

- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \$1950 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1950 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs per day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs per day.
- Therefore, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs are consumed in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly egg consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."

- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).

6. **Solve for the current population \(P\):**
   \[
   P / 2 = 60000 \implies P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So we have:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who showed up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Calculate the cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of boys in the classroom is 30.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Therefore, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can find the number of electric poles by setting up a proportion.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by dividing the number of wires by 3.

Let's calculate the number of electric poles:
\[
\text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if Meg also has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since the problem does not specify the capacity of each box, we can assume that each box can hold 12 pencils (as 72 divided by 6 equals 12, and 72 divided by 12 equals 6, but the simplest and most straightforward assumption is 12 pencils per box).

So, the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils is:

\[ \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:
\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to account for the addition of 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the total weakening of the coffee.

Thus, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the addition of cream (which is 0 in this case):
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[
2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Since we need the final answer in hours, we convert 120 minutes into hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $43 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they get $2 off their next purchase.

However, they used their rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the $2 rewards were reduced by $4 (twice the amount of rewards).

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid after applying the rewards and the coupon:

1. Subtract the rewards from the total spent:
\[ 43 - 2 = 41 \]

2. Subtract the amount taken off by the coupon:
\[ 41 - 4 = 37 \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{37}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Job B has an additional 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8400 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

Next, we need to divide this total number of guns equally among the four people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ).

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches of suckers, the sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch of fudge, the sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 \) ounces.

Now, sum the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = (Sugar for 8 batches of suckers) + (Sugar for 1 batch of fudge).

Let's do the calculations:
- Sugar for 8 batches of suckers: \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.
- Sugar for 1 batch of fudge: \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.
- Total sugar needed: \( 240 + 70 = 310 \) ounces.

So, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is 310 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. She initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value of her shares is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. So, he would have started juggling with \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls. However, when he slips and drops 3 balls, he loses 1 completely and 2 are caught by people in the crowd. Therefore, the number of balls he has left to juggle is \(7 - 1 - 2 = 4\).

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds more than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 - 10 = 40\) pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Weight of the pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of the blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of the green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of the yellow snake: 40 pounds
- Weight of the red bird: 30 pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 = 240 \]

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice.
2. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
3. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day, the additional distance he should run is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson runs is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance he runs in June is:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is 2."
"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then sum the results for both types of tables.

\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the two results together to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies given to her son and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractor production:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractor production is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silo production:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silo production is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself:

- Remaining budget after mini-golf and go-karts: $90 - $25 = $65

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this amount from the remaining budget:

- Remaining budget after arcade tokens: $65 - $5 = $60

This remaining amount of $60 is what she can spend on her friends. Since each friend gets $5, we divide the remaining budget by $5 to find out how many friends she can invite:

- Number of friends she can invite: $60 / $5 = 12

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves in total over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, second to third, and third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find the number of days between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is:

\[ 49 \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we sum up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
\[ C + \text{shoplifting} + \text{violence} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 19. \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate how many points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points is:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost for one picture frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for all the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"

1. **Friday Sales:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
- On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which means she had \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours of practice.

Now, we add up the hours for each day:
\[ 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then find out how many of those pieces were faulty and how many were functioning.

First, let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).

Given that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is:
\[ 0.4N \]

Therefore, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is:

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is:

\[
\text{Pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. The number of socks she has missed is the total number of socks minus the number of socks she has washed:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then determine the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (R) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 150 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. If he had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then the 12.8 hectares represent the remaining 2/5 of his land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \). According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \) hectares.

To find \( L \), we can set up the equation and solve for \( L \):

\[
\frac{2}{5}L = 12.8
\]

To isolate \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the performance is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so the total cost for both is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

With a 20% savings on bundling, the cost is reduced by:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, so recording takes 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

Editing takes 90 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time spent}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system. Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. Let's denote the number of books in the shelving system as \( B \). Therefore, the number of books Wendy wants to place is:
\[ 2B + 20 \]

Since the shelving system has 36 slots, we set \( B = 36 \):
\[ 2B + 20 = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Thus, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before giving any away is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She gave 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she had initially:
\[ 50 - 24 - 5 + 17 \]

Let's perform the calculation step by step:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is:
\[ 38 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. The bike costs $300, so he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to work to earn $250 is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final numerical answer is 12."

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"First, let's determine the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour and per day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the air conditioner uses 0.9 kilowatts (kW) per hour.

If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the new daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original daily consumption and the new daily consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} - 2.7 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \times 30 = 135 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 135 \]"

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[ \text{Total sandwiches needed} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

**Total cost:**
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"

So, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the house as soon as he finishes the book, which will take 30 minutes. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet - 6,000 feet = -3,000 feet. However, since we are asked how many feet Oliver must climb, and climbing downward is considered negative climbing, the answer is -3,000 feet. But if we interpret the question as how many feet Oliver must travel to reach Stanley's comb, the answer would be 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3,000 feet."
"First, we need to determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **\$324**."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the soup is:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the cake is:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with \( x = 100 \) cards.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 36 guests would eat two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{36}{2} \times 2 = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each wanting a second hotdog, is:

\[
40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer only had 36 hotdogs initially. Therefore, the number of hotdogs short of what was needed is:

\[
80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the number of guests who wanted a second hotdog minus the number of hotdogs available:

\[
40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set cost $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The items are 20% off, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5.

2. **Determine the amount of money George had left:**
   Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount he had left is:
   \[
   0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of money spent on chips:**
   Since he spent $5 in total and had 5 cents left, the amount spent on chips is:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} = 495 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags of chips George bought:**
   Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{495}{40} = 12.375
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the chips:**
   The cost of 12 bags of chips is:
   \[
   12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   The total amount spent on chips and candy bars is 495 cents. Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is:
   \[
   495 - 480 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

7. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. We do this by subtracting the time Bernadette takes to drive from the time Wayne takes to drive:

\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Time for Wayne's drive} - \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 - 16 = -12 \text{ minutes}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can find the width using the area formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the temperature increase from the oven to the initial temperature and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(100 + 5 = 105\) minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 105 + R = 141 + R\]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[141 + R = 190 + 10\]
\[141 + R = 200\]
\[R = 200 - 141\]
\[R = 59\]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, for 16 miles the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of one popcorn with a soda with the super ticket is $21 (since the popcorn and soda cost $1 extra).

The cost of a movie ticket is $12, and the cost of one popcorn and one soda is \( P + 3 \). According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and the regular price of the popcorn and soda is $18.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 18 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 18 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 18 - 15 \]

\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $3.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050

- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many rubies Jenna has after the trade. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she has 2 rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

The number of yellow cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"First, let's determine how many fairies joined the original 50 fairies that Katelyn saw. According to the problem, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that number is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, 25 fairies joined the original 50 fairies. Now, we need to calculate the total number of fairies after these 25 fairies joined:

\[
50 + 25 = 75
\]

Next, the problem states that 30 fairies flew away ten minutes later. To find out how many fairies are remaining, we subtract the 30 fairies that flew away from the 75 fairies:

\[
75 - 30 = 45
\]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:

"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from aluminum cans + Earnings from plastic bottles
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:

- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final numerical answer is 84 cents."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of each remora is 6 inches, which is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the cost before any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. Since she is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs for free. Therefore, she only pays for 2 packs, which is still $8.00.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $8.00 cost:

- The total cost after applying the coupon is \(8 - 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

Finally, we calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the number of razors:

- The cost per razor is \(\frac{6}{8} = 0.75\) dollars.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

- \(0.75 \times 100 = 75\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 75 cents."

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the total number of oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, we substitute \( D = 9 \) into the expression:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Together, they used:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of a skein} \]

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the total yards of yarn used is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, the total yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each.

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Couch's length} = 2 \times \text{Rug's width} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost \( \frac{2}{2} = $1 \).

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the bus pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day and does this 5 days a week. So, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of the bus pass is $20 per week.

To find out how much she would save by buying the bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

  - 4 skeins per scarf
  - Total skeins for scarves = 3 scarves * 4 skeins/scarf = 12 skeins

- Sweaters: 3 grandchildren * 1 sweater each = 3 sweaters
  - 12 skeins per sweater
  - Total skeins for sweaters = 3 sweaters * 12 skeins/sweater = 36 skeins

- Mittens: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair each = 3 pairs
  - 1 skein per pair
  - Total skeins for mittens = 3 pairs * 1 skein/pair = 3 skeins

- Socks: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair each = 3 pairs
  - 2 skeins per pair
  - Total skeins for socks = 3 pairs * 2 skeins/pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins:
- Total skeins = 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks)
- Total skeins = 63

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on each day.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Tuesday.

Initially, Chris has 100 problems. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is:
\[100 - 12 - 36 = 52\]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. One-quarter of 52 is:
\[\frac{52}{4} = 13\]

So, after Wednesday, the number of problems left is:
\[52 - 13 = 39\]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39.

\[
\boxed{39}

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

1. Start with the initial number of loaves baked: 200 loaves.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning: 200 - 93 = 107 loaves.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon: 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, we divide the total number of red tulips by 6:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips}
\]

Next, we calculate how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, we divide the total number of blue tulips by 8:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips}
\]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[
6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows of flowers}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will have for the cookies after dividing the bag equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix.

The total amount of raisins is 27 cups. If she divides the raisins equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost: \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost: \( 14 \times 1.50 = 21 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before adding the new device:**
- Weekly cost: \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars

**Weekly cost after adding the new device:**
- Weekly cost: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bills before and after adding the new device.

**Difference:**

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much one person can paint in one hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \div 24 \text{ hours per day} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the amount of house they can paint in one hour is:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{5}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}
\]

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the rate:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:
\[
48

"First, let's determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[
\text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[
\text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[
\text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84
\]

The total number of chairs is:

\[
\text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88
\]

Adding the total number of sofas and chairs together, we get:

\[
\text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, considering the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out. According to the information provided, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours in one week. So, we add these extra hours to the total:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the extra hours to the initial total:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 80\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(80 - 21 + 7 = 66\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then Jame's cousin's current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.
   - The age difference between them is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April and then figure out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month.

April has 30 days. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, he needs to save $1125 in April.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the number of days in the second half of April would be \( 30 - x \).

According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( y \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2y \).

The total savings for the first half of the month would be \( x \cdot y \), and the total savings for the second half of the month would be \( (30 - x) \cdot 2y \).

The sum of these savings should equal Elvis's monthly target:
\[ x \cdot y + (30 - x) \cdot 2y = 1125 \]

We can simplify this equation:
\[ x \cdot y + 60y - 2x \cdot y = 1125 \]
\[ 60y - x \cdot y = 1125 \]
\[ y(60 - x) = 1125 \]

To find \( y \), we need to determine \( x \). Since \( x \) must be a whole number between 0 and 30, we can test values to find a suitable \( x \).

Let's test \( x = 15 \):
\[ y(60 - 15) = 1125 \]
\[ 45y = 1125 \]
\[ y = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ y = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars per day.

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50 \]

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is 80."

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

1. Commission on the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission on first } \$1000 = \$1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. Commission on the amount over $1000 ($1500):
\[ \text{Commission on } \$1500 = \$1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

3. Total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles of water:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we can find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the total number of bottles he needs:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice as long as 16 minutes is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can find this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

160"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons that have 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes from the buttons with 2 holes and the holes from the buttons with 4 holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia is \( R \), and Juan's current intake is \( 5R \), we need to express the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups. The reduction in cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, we need to find out how many cups this reduction is in terms of the daily recommended cups \( R \). Since \( 5R \) is 5 times the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

To find the exact reduction in terms of \( R \), we can express it as:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups is \( R \), the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Given that \( R \) is the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups is \( R \), the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

To provide a specific numerical answer, we need the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommended cup amount), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles James needs. Since he needs one candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to calculate how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age. According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the fourth tooth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \) dollars.
   - For the fifth tooth, the tooth fairy again gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \) dollars.
   - Total for these two teeth: \(0.5 + 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. This is 4 days, so he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After spending $40 on wooden action figures, Peter has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the price of Juan's house by finding 30% of Herb's house price and subtracting it from Herb's house price.

The price of Herb's house is $76,000. To find 30% of $76,000, we use the following calculation:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Subtracting this amount from Herb's house price gives us the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we need to find the combined value of both houses. We add the price of Herb's house and the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of contacts Pete will get with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs Pete will get is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

On Saturday, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

On Sunday, John worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's total earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's total earnings:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

"First, let's determine the increase in Jared's typing speed. He starts at 47 WPM and increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. The increase in speed is:

\[ 52 - 47 = 5 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, if he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. The average is calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

First, we sum the values:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Then, we divide by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the weekly protein intake is:
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
- One of the implants has an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much more money George needs after his deposit.

- George has already put down a deposit of $600.
- The total cost of the dental work is $4500.
- So, the remaining amount George needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining $3900.

- George earns $15 per hour.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine how many gumballs Colby can buy based on the value of his coins.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01 = $0.15

Total value of Colby's coins: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05, we can calculate the number of gumballs he can buy by dividing the total value of his coins by the cost of one gumball:

Number of gumballs = $3.45 / $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump in dollars, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the funding per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - The total cost for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The final numerical answer is $1,450,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

The total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days it will take to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.
- Therefore, the amount of meat sold per day is \( 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, we know the total amount of meat from the bull is 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell this amount, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount sold per day:
- Total meat from the bull: 750 kg.
- Meat sold per day: 150 kg/day.
- Number of days to sell the meat: \( \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \).

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school, we get:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ \text{Pieces left} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 classes:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per class if the total cost is more than $10 per class. We set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} > \$10 \text{ per class} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \$6 > \$10 \text{ per class} \]

This inequality is false, which means the total cost of $60 is not more than $10 per class. Therefore, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the given condition.

Since the total cost of $60 is not more than $10 per class, Manny can miss all 10 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, assuming they work all days of the week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

The total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{216}{60} = 3.6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer in seconds is:

\[ 216 \text{ seconds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \) dollars
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's sum up the costs of these features:

\[ 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 13500 \]

The base price of the truck is $30,000. Adding the cost of the additional features to the base price gives:

\[ 30000 + 13500 = 43500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the promotion, we need to consider both the raise and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \).

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
- \( 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( 20000 \times 0.5 = 10000 \).

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- \( 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, to find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:

Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so his age is:
\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 29 \]"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine the amount of flour in one bag.

Given that one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales from green hats in the second month:**
   - The sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Sales from red hats in the second month = 1/2 of the sales from red hats in the first month = $400 * 1/2 = $200.
   - Total sales in the second month = $200 + $900 = $1100.

5. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $1100 = $2300.

The final numerical answer is $2300."
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - This is a total of 4 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours).

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Therefore, the paid hours are 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.
   - The cost for the second hour is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.
   - The cost for the third hour is \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \) dollars.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: $30

   - Total cost: \( 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{105}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. Therefore, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week:

\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Weekly wage} - \text{Amount earned this week} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \$300 - \$220 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \$80 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike plans to read per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rental cost for the hanger, and the monthly cost for fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Rental Cost for the Hanger**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel**: Twice the rental cost for the hanger, which is \(2 \times 5000 = 10,000\)

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:

- **Total Rental Cost for the Hanger in a Year**: \(5000 \times 12 = 60,000\)
- **Total Fuel Cost in a Year**: \(10,000 \times 12 = 120,000\)

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20, so \( S + G = 20 \).
4. The total number of animal legs is 70, so \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina had twelve good days and eight bad days, which means the number of neutral days is:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days} \]

Next, we need to check the distribution of good, bad, and neutral days over the first thirty days:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were bad.
- The last eight days were neutral.

This distribution matches the given numbers:
- Good days: 8 (first eight days) + 4 (from the remaining 12 good days) = 12
- Bad days: 8 (second eight days) = 8
- Neutral days: 8 (third eight days) = 10

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. James then finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs in the shelter. This means he needs to buy toys for 24 - 12 = 12 more dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 12 more dogs} = 12 \]

So far, James has bought toys for 4 dogs and then for 12 more dogs, which totals:

\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he no longer needs the 3 toys.

\[ \text{Final total of toys needed} = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"

"To solve this problem, we can first determine the number of hash browns that can be made from one potato. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato as follows:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:

\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total weight that Jack and the 8 other adults will be carrying in the elevator.

The weight of Jack is 80 kg.
The weight of each of the 8 other adults is also 80 kg.

So, the total weight of the 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem, Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ 298 \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn, we add the time taken in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station, which is the sum of the time it takes to get to the corner and the time it takes to get to the fire station from there.

Time to get to the corner = 6 minutes
Time to get to the fire station from the corner = 13 minutes

Total time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. So, the remaining time they have to get to school without being late is:

Remaining time = Total time available - Total time to get to the fire station
Remaining time = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

The final numerical answer is 11."

Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times \text{Cookies baked by Greta} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = \text{Cookies baked by Greta} + \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Then, we account for the cookies that Greta and Celinda eat while the cookies are cooling. They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = \text{Total cookies baked} - \text{Cookies eaten} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets is 6, we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13. The final numerical answer is:

- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for nap
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years, Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"First, let's determine the number of each colored square on Brittany's quilted comforter.

- The number of red squares is given as 14.
- The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
  \]
- The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
  \]
- The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
  \]

Now, let's find the total number of squares on the comforter by summing up all the squares:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 (\text{red}) + 18 (\text{blue}) + 24 (\text{green}) + 12 (\text{white}) = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is equal to the total number of squares:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise this remaining amount at a rate of $2100 in 3 hours, which means they raise $700 per hour (since $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour).
5. To find out how many hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at this rate, we divide $4200 by $700 per hour, which gives us 6 hours.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

The final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost of 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

With the deal, for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free). Now, let's see how many sets of $3.00 Erin can spend with her $6.00:

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops with her $6.00. Therefore, the total number of scoops she can buy is:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats as follows:

\[ \text{Ginger's candy eaten} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 56 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ \text{Ginger's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 56 \, \text{pieces} = 44 \, \text{pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats as follows:

\[ \text{Amy's candy eaten} = 3 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 42 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ \text{Amy's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 42 \, \text{pieces} = 58 \, \text{pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 58 \, \text{pieces} - 44 \, \text{pieces} = 14 \, \text{pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the total cost James incurred from the total cost at the store:

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price was 10% higher than this amount. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 \]

Let's calculate this product:

"First, let's calculate the total calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the total calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- Total time with arms at her sides: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Total taps with arms at her sides: \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- Total time with arms raised: 2 minutes.
- Total taps with arms raised: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps.

Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios:
- Total taps with arms at her sides: 1650 taps.
- Total taps with arms raised: 800 taps.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
3. The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets, it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[ 450 + 120 + 75 = 645 \]

So, the total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is $645.

Since the pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is:
\[ 450 - 645 = -245 \]

However, since the question asks for the amount of money saved, and the negative value indicates a loss, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

- Therefore, the number of windows she smashes in the teachers' cars is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

The final numerical answer is 112."
"To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to determine the total number of spools of thread and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]
\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, we need to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 54 students each is not possible. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can accommodate all 54 students with each group having an equal number of students.

To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we need to find the divisors of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.

Since we are forming 12 groups and need to find out how many more groups are needed to form, we need to determine the smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students. The smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students is 54 groups (each with 1 student).

Given that we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 54 groups:
\[ 54 - 12 = 42 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, we need to determine how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, we need to determine how many small stickers she has left after trading 27 small stickers. She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ small stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 3 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 3 small buttons from trading 3 small stickers. Each small button is worth \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button, so 3 small buttons are worth:

\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ large button} \]

Adding the large buttons she received from trading large stickers and the small buttons she received from trading small stickers, we get:

\[ 20 \text{ large buttons} + 1 \text{ large button} = 21 \text{ large buttons} \]

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \).

\[
\boxed{22}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song in hours} \]
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since these 18 Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of all the puppies Jana has, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( x \)):
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 18 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ x = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

\[ \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time he spends driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours, to the time spent driving to and from the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars.
\[ 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 57 \text{ cars} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles.
\[ 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} \times 73 \text{ motorcycles} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find 20% of $1000:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1000 = \frac{20}{100} \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = \$200 \]

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

\[ \$1000 - \$200 = \$800 \]

So, the final amount you have to pay is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

Next, we find the number of movies that are not in series:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Now, we calculate the number of older movies among the non-series movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older:

\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, and the cost for the non-series movies is $10 each. The cost for the older non-series movies is $5 each.

\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
\[ \text{Cost for non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
\[ \text{Cost for older non-series movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score can be represented as \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score can be represented as \( S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for \( E_a \) and \( B_a \) into Ava's score equation, we get:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Since Emma's score is \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), the difference in their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. We know the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on 5 days.
   - Twice the usual times on the other 2 days.

2. **Usual Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Usual daily biking frequency = 3 times.

3. **Biking Frequency on Special Days:**
   - On special days, they ride twice the usual times.
   - Twice the usual times = 2 * 3 = 6 times.

4. **Total Biking for Usual Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Total biking for usual days = 3 times/day * 5 days = 15 times.

5. **Total Biking for Special Days:**
   - They ride 6 times a day for 2 days.
   - Total biking for special days = 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

6. **Total Biking in a Week:**
   - Total biking in a week = Total biking for usual days + Total biking for special days.
   - Total biking in a week = 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, the total distance he drives in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons he consumes in a week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas he consumes in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money spent is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. So, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the next week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the next week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[
20

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{780} = 1 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 100%.

The final numerical answer is:
100%"
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 (total ordered) - 150 (already sold) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches he climbed in a week (7 days), to find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide the total branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 flower of each type, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Therefore, the number of petals remaining in the vase is:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total playtime for each person in minutes. Since they play for 4 hours, we convert this to minutes:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. Therefore, the number of quarters Jack uses is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

One of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of quarters this friend uses is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \]

Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of quarters this friend uses is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \]

The remaining friend is significantly worse and can only play for half as long as Jack, which is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of quarters this friend uses is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \]

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used by all four friends:

\[ 12 + 24 + 8 + 24 = 68 \text{ quarters} \]

Since each quarter costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is:

\[ 68 \text{ quarters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Calculate the total time in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   
   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the total time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the initial items (4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures) is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The number of additional mirrors needed is \(6 - 4 = 2\).
   - The number of additional chandeliers needed is \(2 - 1 = 1\).
   - The number of additional pictures needed is \(20 - 10 = 10\).

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - The cost for the additional mirrors is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - The cost for the additional chandeliers is \(1 \times 15 = 15\).
   - The cost for the additional pictures is \(10 \times 15 = 150\).

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the base cost and the additional cost.

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $224.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the information given, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony has saved:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"First, let's establish the relationships between the heights of the mountains each person can lift:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Now, we need to convert the height Naruto can lift a mountain from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the height in inches by 12:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours initially, so the distance covered in the first part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he travels for another 6 hours at the same rate, so the distance covered in the second part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding both parts of the journey together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to complete the journey.

First, let's establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos and the time it takes for them to cross the highway. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, then the total ""kangaroo-hours"" required to cross the highway is:
\[ 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours} \]

This means that the total distance \(D\) to cross the highway is 54 kangaroo-hours. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

Since the speed of each turtle is half that of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is \(\frac{1}{2}\) the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the time it takes for one turtle to cover the distance \(D\) is:
\[ \text{Time for one turtle} = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} = \frac{D}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ speed of a kangaroo}} = 2 \times \text{Time for one kangaroo} \]

Since the total distance \(D\) is 54 kangaroo-hours, the time it takes for one kangaroo to cover the distance is:
\[ \text{Time for one kangaroo} = \frac{54 \text{ kangaroo-hours}}{3 \text{ kangaroos}} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for one turtle to cover the distance is:
\[ \text{Time for one turtle} = 2 \times 18 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 turtles, the total time for 4 turtles to cover the distance is:
\[ \text{Total time for 4 turtles} = 4 \times 36 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours it will take for four turtles to cross the highway is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine how many dishes each person made based on the information provided.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes} \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we add the number of dishes each made:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[ 140 \]"
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price of the laptop is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money she has is:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam decides to slice 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam decides to slice 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
\[ \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
\[ \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
\[ \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths:
\[ \text{Total remaining length} = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Gabriel has a total of $5000 from working on weekends plus $200 from his brother, which sums up to $5200. The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800. Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons combined:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons from the initial amount of money he had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as he had socks. If Jack collected 60 dishes, then he had:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many socks Peter has. The problem states that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together. Jack has 60 dishes and 30 socks, and Peter has 60 socks and 0 dishes (since the problem does not specify any dishes Peter has). Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes is:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 0 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students is 20.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, the total number of students good at math (which includes those who are good at both math and English) is:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

The time for one group is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for one group including the intermission is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since 225% is equivalent to 2.25 in decimal form:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is:

30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats, and after selling 10 goats, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats, and after selling 20 goats, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you are buying 3 baskets, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. Therefore, the effective cost per basket of red food is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ \boxed{123} \]"

2. Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms: Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.
- Let \( Y \) be my age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), we substitute \( B = Y + 3 \) (since \( Y = B - 3 \)) to get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B + 6 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B = 81 \]

Since \( B = Y + 3 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5Y + (Y + 3) = 81 \]
\[ 6Y + 3 = 81 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Since Claire takes 1 month, Amber takes:
\[ 2 \times 1 \text{ month} = 2 \text{ months} \]
to earn a badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, subtract the total number of burritos given to the students and the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{28} \]"

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost that Madeline pays.
2. Calculate the total monthly cost that Keenan pays.
3. Determine the weekly cost that Keenan pays.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost. So, we calculate Madeline's share as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400, Keenan's share is:
\[ \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will have is:

\[
\text{Total money Sarah will have} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left after she buys the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she needs 20 meters of it:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that she earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and assuming she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns were $80. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales can be calculated by subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6x \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of times \( x \) she mowed Joe's lawn, we can't determine the exact numerical value of \( x \). However, we can express the earnings from lemonade sales in terms of \( x \):
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6x \]

Without the specific value of \( x \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( x = 1 \) (which is a reasonable assumption given the problem's context), then:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6 \times 1 = 74 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. His profit is the total earnings minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's total notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of bowls that can be filled from the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill 8 child's bowls.
   - Therefore, the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls.

4. **Calculate the number of leftover bowls after the family has eaten:**
   - The family needs 4 bowls in total.
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, all 4 bowls will be used up by the family.

5. **Determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and the pot can fill 8 child's bowls.
   - Therefore, the 8 child's bowls can be distributed among the 2 children, allowing each child to have 4 bowls.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to 26:
\[ \text{Adam's current age} = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Let's calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we will calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \$11 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons:
\[ \text{Cost per 2 balloons} = \$0.5 \]
\[ \text{Number of sets of 2 balloons in 12 balloons} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the balloons} = 6 \times \$0.5 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7:
\[ \text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of the cake} + \text{Cost of the balloons} + \text{Cost of the ice cream} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend this total amount, the amount each received is half of the total amount spent:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. Since she has 27 cups and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since she divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row is:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information given:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ berries} \]

So, the sloth picks up 12 berries in 4 hours. To find out how many berries he picks up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Thus, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{12 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 6 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4 \text{ R } 2\]

This means he can buy 4 more full-priced tickets, and he will have $2 left over, which is not enough to buy another full-priced ticket.

Therefore, the number of additional movies Colby can see is:

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Adding these together gives us the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also received 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons at this point is 8 (for her friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 additional balloons.

Adding the additional balloons to the initial total, we get 10 (initial total) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff. So, the total number of boxes donated is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. So, the total number of boxes available is:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are needed to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

3. The number of tables needed to fit 60 boxes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

4. The number of new tables needed is:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables needed} - 15 \text{ tables owned} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
15

"First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spits:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people:
- Number of people = 2
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 12-hour stay plus additional hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1600 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for this option is 1600 + 350 = 1950 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be 2440 - 1950 = 490 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
490"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of hay needed for all the livestock, we add the hay needed for the goats and the hay needed for the sheep:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig to the total number of letters spelled out by his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

Here's the calculation:

- Number of children in each row = 8
- Number of rows per school = 7
- Number of schools = 5

Total number of children = Number of children in each row × Number of rows per school × Number of schools

Let's calculate this:

\[
\text{Total number of children} = 8 \times 7 \times 5
\]

First, calculate \(8 \times 7\):

\[
8 \times 7 = 56
\]

Next, multiply the result by 5:

\[
56 \times 5 = 280

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles obtained from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged \(\boxed{178.75}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up all the earnings.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for him to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance to be swum, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time taken to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, rest time, and the time to swim the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had 70 loaves, we calculate:

\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission from NYT} + \text{Commission from WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age based on the information given.

1. We know that Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years.
3. Marcus is also half of Leo's age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the second equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

"First, we need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this into minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, we subtract these 6 spoons from the original number of measuring spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people at the concert. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we will call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \).

So, \( 4 \times H_1 = 31 \).

Solving for \( H_1 \):
\[ H_1 = \frac{31}{4} = 7.75 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the problem's setup or interpretation. However, we can proceed with the given numbers and assume the problem is correctly set up.

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes at the end of the third day was 31, and the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the number of holes at the end of the third day before filling was:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the first day was 7.75, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day was 31, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the information given.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

Let's calculate the total number of corn chips:

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = \text{Amora's chips} + \text{Lainey's chips} + \text{Collins' chips}
\]

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85
\]

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 225
\]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

\[
\boxed{225}

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the additional cost for the travel tickets is $200. Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

     \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies she received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. We need to convert this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes this represents, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and the remaining boxes were sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges sold is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Since 1.5 feet is equivalent to 18 inches, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

The total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can calculate how many such units fit into the flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/unit}} = 44.4 \text{ units} \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a unit in this context, we take the whole number part, which means 44 units can fit, and there will be some space left over. However, we need to consider the 17 plants Pat already owns. Each of these plants takes up 12 inches, so the total space taken by these plants is:

\[ 17 \text{ plants} \times 12 \text{ inches/plant} = 204 \text{ inches} \]

Subtracting this from the total length of the flower bed gives us the remaining space:

\[ 1332 \text{ inches} - 204 \text{ inches} = 1128 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can determine how many additional plants can fit in the remaining space:

\[ \frac{1128 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/unit}} = 37.6 \text{ units} \]

Again, taking the whole number part, we can fit 37 additional plants. Therefore, the total number of plants Pat will have is:

\[ 17 \text{ (already owned)} + 37 \text{ (additional)} = 54 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 54 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 324 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No cooling, so the temperature increases by 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is:
- Net change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 4 degrees during this period. Therefore, the final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The room was initially 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, but since it warmed up by 4 degrees, the final temperature is 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

3. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88. \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by calculating \( \frac{1}{4}F \):
\[ \text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to the $30 he bought the trousers with:

\[ 30 + 6 + 12 = 48 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $0 from his savings because the total amount he received from his mother and father was enough to cover the $30 he spent on the trousers.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the average age of the group:**
   - The total age of the children is 20.
   - There are 4 children.
   - The average age is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Use the information about Helene's age:**
   - Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
   - Therefore, Helene's age is:
     \[
     \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Wilfred:**
   - The total age of all four children is 20.
   - Akbar is 3 years old.
   - Alessandro is 4 years old.
   - Let Wilfred's age be \( W \).
   - The combined age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Wilfred is:
     \[
     3 + 4 + W = 7 + W
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total age:**
   - The sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred is 20.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     7 + W + 10 = 20
     \]

5. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     17 + W = 20
     \]
   - Subtract 17 from both sides:
     \[
     W = 20 - 17 = 3

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare it with the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time Doctor Jones works:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining time from minutes to hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, let's calculate the total earnings per week:
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, let's calculate the total earnings per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate the volume in gallons:

\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the total cost:

\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \approx C \times 0.531 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.531 = 0.28 \]

To find the initial charge \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.531} \approx 0.528 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.528 \) or 52.8%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we calculate the number of pieces each friend received by multiplying the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures, but we don't need to know the exact number of those for this calculation.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are divided equally among 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
2. **Guests who checked out early**: 24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, after the early checkouts, there are 76 guests remaining.
3. **Guests who checked out late**: 15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   So, after the late checkouts, there are 61 guests remaining.
4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   So, after the new guests checked in, there are 91 guests.
5. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]
   So, after the additional guests checked in, there are 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is \(\boxed{98}\)."

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding the number of questions she is sure to get correct from the easy, average, and difficult questions:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from the cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the cupcakes. Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from the cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total earnings from both the cookies and the cupcakes:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so the total amount she gave away is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - A month has 30 days.
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \( 18 \) pounds per day.
   - In 30 days, one dwarf mines \( 18 \times 30 = 540 \) pounds of ore.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 40 dwarves.
   - Each dwarf mines 540 pounds in a month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{8} = 1.5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
x = 1.5 \times 8 = 12
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher will not collect the homework. This means there's a 50% chance the normal teacher will collect the homework.
   
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension**: If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.
   
3. **Personal Extension**: If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

We can break down the scenarios as follows:

- **Substitute Teacher and No Extension**: 50% chance * 60% chance = 30% chance.
- **Normal Teacher and No Extension**: 50% chance * 80% chance = 40% chance.
- **Normal Teacher with Extension**: 50% chance * 40% chance = 20% chance.

The only scenario where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is if the substitute teacher comes in and he doesn't get an extension, or if the normal teacher comes in and he doesn't get an extension and he doesn't get a personal extension. The probability of this scenario is 30% + 40% = 70%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 70% = 30%.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place the candy in each bottle.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time it will take to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and place the candy, and he needs to do this 7 times (from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh bottle to the eighth), the total time is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and worked the entire time. This would be his original income over the 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total income he earned during his college years is his new income over the 4 years:

\[ 75,000 \times 4 = 300,000 \]

The total income he lost by going to college is the difference between the income he would have earned if he had not gone and the income he earned during his college years:

\[ 300,000 - 100,000 = 200,000 \]

This $200,000 is the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans he took out, plus the $100,000 in income he lost by not working during his college years. Therefore, the total amount he needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since his new income is $75,000 per year, the number of years it would take him to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it would take him 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
- Width: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Then, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.50

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\$21.50}{3} = \$7.1667 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.17} \]"

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
1.96875

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Now, we substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.491009 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.491009 = 9820.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9820} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already traveled. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther she needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already traveled from the total distance.

\[ \text{Distance remaining} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already traveled} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase is 60% of the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of loads for twin beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

2. **Determine the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the amount of cat food one cat consumes per day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, the total amount of cat food consumed by all 3 cats per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per day} \times 3 = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost of the cast: $200

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change. The change she receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."

Given:
\[ B = 90 \]
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Now, substitute Binkie's score into the equation for Frankie's score:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = $250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = $32,500 \)
- Earnings from BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = $11,250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = $67,500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales made by farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales picked up by truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
\[ \text{Bales left in the field} = 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

"To determine how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of periods John attends each day.
2. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day.
3. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week.
4. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time each week.
5. Sum the minutes spent in class and on extra learning time to get the total weekly minutes spent learning.
6. Convert the total weekly minutes spent learning into hours.

Let's go through each step:

1. John has 6 periods in a day and takes 2 extra classes, so he attends \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.
2. Each period is 40 minutes long, so he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.
3. He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.
4. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the extra learning time each week is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.
5. The total weekly minutes spent learning is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.
6. To convert the total weekly minutes spent learning into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling the apples."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which is \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:

   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to determine how many more years she needs to work beyond the initial 20 years to reach the total of 40 years.

\[
\text{Additional years needed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

There are 3 women wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of all the heels is:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of 6 heels (3 from the 4 inch heels group and 3 from the 2 inch heels group).

The average height of the heels is:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

First, we know that Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

Next, we calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day:
\[ \text{Additional miles per day needed} = 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her at least \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 5 hours).

Now, we sum the time each person took to complete their chores:
\[ 4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to find out how far Sofie will walk in seven days and then use that information to find out how far Brian will walk.

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Therefore, in 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by all four workers in one hour:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in one shift is:
- \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
- \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

However, we calculated that the four workers produced 200 toys in one shift. This discrepancy indicates that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions, but based on the given information, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up the difference:
- The total number of toys needed is 400.
- The number of toys already produced is 200.
- Therefore, the fifth worker needs to produce \(400 - 200 = 200\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour, we divide the total number of toys needed by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
- \(200 \div 10 = 20\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker needs to produce \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

2. According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince:
   - Let Vince's age two years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(14 = 2x\).

3. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{14}{2} = 7

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since there are 25 groups, there will be 25 boxes, each weighing 8 ounces. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate how much money John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, we can calculate the distance she covers on the beach as follows:
\[ \text{Distance on the beach} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 40v \text{ miles} \]

Since the total distance on the beach is 2 miles, we have:
\[ 40v = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up the birds in each tree:

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring out 4 ounces. Since the temperature of the water is uniform throughout the mug, the temperature of the remaining water in the mug will still be 33 degrees.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the second mug after pouring out 1 ounce. The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug will still be \( T \) degrees.

Now, we need to find the average temperature of the water in the water bottle after Donny pours the water. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the water in the water bottle will be the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from the two mugs. The formula for the weighted average temperature is:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell is getting in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he is ordering 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

First, calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Finally, subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

The number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a decade.
2. Multiply the number of lemons from one tree by the number of trees Tim grows.

First, since each tree yields 6 lemons per year, in a decade (which is 10 years), one tree will yield:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, since Tim grows 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in a decade is:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \text{Number of passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
- Number of men = 5 parts * 6 passengers per part = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 parts * 6 passengers per part = 54 women

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"First, let's determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day from selling the sunflowers individually. Since each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers per day}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, let's determine how many bouquets of sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per day from selling bouquets is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from individual sales and the sunflowers sold from bouquet sales:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales} + \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquet sales} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
291

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

The cost to buy 20 rocks is $100. The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

The loss Adam incurs is the difference between the cost of the rocks and the revenue from selling them:

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$16 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. So, the total land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each transaction:

1. From the first transaction: $50
2. From the second transaction: $30
3. From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3/square meter = $60

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment in all complexes, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \text{ collections} \times \$0.40 \text{ per collection} = \$1248 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1248 \]"
"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850 \]

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) \]

The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope \( Y \) is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa originally had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - So, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - So, Ronnie is left with \(5\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the information given:

- The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since the mural is divided into four parts and half is yellow, the other half is divided into three parts (red, white, and purple). This means that the red, white, and purple parts together make up half of the mural.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), and purple paint as \( P \). According to the problem, \( R = W = P \).

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow parts:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \):
\[ R + R + R + Y = 12 \]
\[ 3R + Y = 12 \]

We also know that the yellow part is half of the mural:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]
Substituting \( Y = 6 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is \( 2 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find out how many puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 puffs

The final numerical answer is 93."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pods in the new box and then calculate how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. Since the regular box has 100 pods, the new box will have:

\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, $1 worth of pods will allow us to run 1 cycle.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with $1 is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which means team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The values satisfy both equations, confirming that Colin is currently 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total and that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can calculate the number of $500 units in $27,000 and then multiply by 100.

The number of $500 units in $27,000 is:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes this amount of money between 3 schools, so the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Similarly, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt 4 times in an hour. Therefore, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the number of snowballs Jay actually makes in an hour is:
\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs. Since he makes 12 snowballs per hour, the number of hours required to make 60 snowballs is:
\[ \frac{60}{12} = 5 \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or an additional constraint not considered. Given the problem's constraints and our calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final numerical answer is 100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Over 4 weeks, the total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$40 = \$310 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. This means she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of 6 colors is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one of the makeup sets. Therefore, the number of colors left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"First, let's determine Mattison's height in inches:
\[ \text{Mattison's height} = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the height of the first floor. According to the problem, the first floor's height is three times Mattison's height:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor to the roof of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height from the floor to the roof of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells that team Gogetters found is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles for all four dogs. Finally, we can subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average distance walked per dog is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{side length}^2 \times \text{height} = 6^2 \times 15 = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years:**
   - The original cost of one visit is $2.
   - The cost increased by 150%, so the increase is \(2 \times 1.5 = 3\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is \(2 + 3 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - Over 5 years, she visits \(3 \times 5 = 15\) times.
   - The total cost for the first 5 years is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**
   - Over the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The total cost for the next 3 years is \(9 \times 5 = 45\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so the number of groups needed is:
   \[
   \lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \rceil = \lceil 3.75 \rceil = 4 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. Each group spends 45 minutes in the escape room, so the total time required is:
   \[
   4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. Since she has 10 fingers (2 hands), the cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:

"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues per year, and we are asked for the total number of magazines, we need to consider that each magazine is counted once regardless of the number of issues it sends. Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

The final numerical answer is:

An 80% increase on $40 is calculated as:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, we need to calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price of $72.

A 50% decrease on $72 is calculated as:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discount in January is:

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we need to find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels every day without rest, he travels for 24 hours each day.

\[ \text{Total hours traveled} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in 72 hours at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

\[ \text{Distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that 3600 km represents.

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline. She ate 6 grapes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used by her brother to make the grape juice. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Thus, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours they work in a day:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

However, the custodian only has 5 days to complete the cleaning. This means that the 2.5 days of cleaning time is spread over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:

\[ \frac{2.5 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ days} \]

To find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning, we convert the fraction of the day spent cleaning into a percentage:

\[ 0.5 \text{ days} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms is:

So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct to pass:

\[ \text{Total correct answers needed} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ \text{Correct answers needed on the second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. The total number of ice cubes is \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \), we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the first equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

\[
5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) robots.

Since Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, and there were 20 helmets, then there were \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is \( 20 \) (helmets) + \( 10 \) (robots) + \( 40 \) (footballs) = \( 70 \) items.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim works in a week. Since he works 5 days a week and each day he works 6 hours, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total hours worked in a week into minutes because the time it takes to deal with a call is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a week, we divide the total minutes he works in a week by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the additional phones and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial 200 kernels, the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the number of hot dogs he still needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

For the cookies:
- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both cupcakes and cookies:
- Total revenue = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of food:
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost of trays = 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, let's calculate the money Frances has left after her expenses:
- Money left = Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60.

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals planned to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents

So, the final numerical answer is 105."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to calculate the ages of all the family members and then sum them up.

1. The ages of the sisters are all 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, the total age for the sisters is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the time she spends meditating in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks contain \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. Therefore, the total time spent meditating in 4 weeks is \(28 \times 30 = 840\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga. She practices yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) every day she practices yoga, and she practices yoga 5 days a week. So, in 4 weeks, she practices yoga \(4 \times 5 = 20\) days. Therefore, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) minutes.

Finally, to find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we add the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga:
\[840 + 1200 = 2040\]

So, the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

For the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

For the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we sum up the square footage from all the t-shirts:

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pens Timothy has. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Since George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

**Step 1: Number of bars produced in one day**
The company produces 5000 bars per day.

**Step 2: Number of bars produced in two weeks**
There are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

**Step 3: Total revenue from selling the bars**
The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price. The discounted price for the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

The profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   \[
   32 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   \[
   95 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would contain 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy. Therefore, the earnings from the first half would be:
6 toy soldiers * $5/toy = $30

For the second half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy. Therefore, the earnings from the second half would be:
6 toy soldiers * $7/toy = $42

Adding the earnings from both halves of the collection, we get:
$30 + $42 = $72

So, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Aaron runs 8 miles in 16 minutes, it means that running 4 miles (half the distance) would take half the time. Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes / 2 = 8 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per week:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per week is:
   \[
   6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

Adding this profit to the original cost price gives us the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the 56 slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
