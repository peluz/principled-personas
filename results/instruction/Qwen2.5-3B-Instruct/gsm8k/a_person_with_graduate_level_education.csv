"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe. We know that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber needed:
\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Next, add the blue and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts:
\[ \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh then adds $50,000 in repairs, and this increases the value of the house by 150%.

The increase in value is calculated as:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh then sells the house for $200,000. The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost (the original price of the house plus the cost of repairs) from the selling price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:
   \[
   \text{Distance per sprint} = 60 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. Determine the total distance James runs in one week for one sprint:
   \[
   \text{Distance per week per sprint} = 60 \text{ meters} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for all sprints:
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 180 \text{ meters} \times 3 \text{ times a week} = 540 \text{ meters}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 glasses / 2 glasses per pair = 8 pairs).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we will sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep.

\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Seattle}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{475}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

students remaining. Next, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the profit the merchant would make from each purchase plan, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market increase and then subtract the initial purchase price.

For the jewelry:
- Initial value: $5,000
- Expected increase: 2.5%
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value: $8,000
- Expected increase: 1.2%
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan with the higher profit. Therefore, the profit would be $125 if the merchant chooses the jewelry.

The final numerical answer is:
125"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs used in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Let \(d\) be the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk, and let \(v\) be the speed she needs to walk this distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12 miles.

The total time for the entire hike should be:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

The time spent hiking the remaining distance \(d\) at speed \(v\) is:
\[
\text{Time for remaining distance} = \frac{d}{v}
\]

The total time spent hiking is the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
\[
2 + \frac{d}{v} = 3
\]

Solving for \(\frac{d}{v}\):
\[
\frac{d}{v} = 3 - 2 = 1
\]

Thus, the remaining distance \(d\) is 1 mile. To find the required speed \(v\):
\[
v = \frac{d}{\text{Time for remaining distance}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
\]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 1 mile per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After pouring the orange drink, we spill one liter, so the remaining amount of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Remaining orange drink} = 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture. The amount of water from the remaining orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water from remaining orange drink} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water from the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water from pineapple drink} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, his son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son was born \(25 - 23 = 2\) years ago.

"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to sum up the number of DVDs bought by each group of customers.

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate of melting to find the total decrease in length.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total decrease in length as follows:

\[
\text{Total decrease in length} = \text{Rate of melting} \times \text{Total time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total decrease in length} = 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

The cost of the pants is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

The cost of the shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of:
\[ \$243 \]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
80

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   \text{Hours per dog per day} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per day} = 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scores is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed.**

Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed for 60 yogurts is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
\text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
\text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
\text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or given away any lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To determine John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the time he spends running each day. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on the first day} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time on the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her running speed is four times her walking speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 4 \times \text{Walking speed} \]
\[ 6 = 4 \times \text{Walking speed} \]
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we can calculate the distance walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age**: We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[
   \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone Age**: Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. This means Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. This means Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin in this condition.

Given:
- Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can still consume to meet your daily target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings you can consume is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can consume is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. Given that the cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, the cost for 2 pounds will be:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the candles. If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes 20 candles, the total revenue will be:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:
  \[
  5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}

  \]

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the new package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes and having 23 remaining, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 220 = 23 - 80 \]
\[ x - 220 = -57 \]
\[ x = -57 + 220 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the time it takes for him to travel back.

Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( D \) miles. The time it takes to travel from the starting point to the destination can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the trip to the destination, the time taken is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to}} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

For the trip back, the speed is 6 mph, so the time taken for the return trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance \( D \) is not provided, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to get back. Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined with the given information.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each charged at $40.

The total charge for truck tires on Thursday is:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60/\text{truck tire} = \$360 \]

The total charge for car tires on Thursday is:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40/\text{car tire} = \$160 \]

The total revenue on Thursday is:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each charged at $40.

The total charge for car tires on Friday is:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40/\text{car tire} = \$480 \]

The total revenue on Friday is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 1
- Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Number of sour oranges = 2

We need to find the number of good oranges. To do this, we can subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges + Number of sour oranges)

Let's calculate this:

Number of good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

Final numerical answer:
17"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the jeweler is $800. Adding these together gives:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the monthly payment for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, the total for the first half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount, so the new monthly rate is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
The total for the second half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the payments from both halves of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Additionally, the total number of games played is 22, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]

So:

\[ W = 15 \]

The number of games they won is 15."

Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad consumed by adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad consumed by children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Adding the amounts consumed by adults and children gives the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we add the number of pets each has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey is 2 years older than Amy).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Now we can set up the equation for Corey's age:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

First, we know that Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee runs it in 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time is:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement means Gerald can now run the hurdles in 90% of his original time. Therefore, we calculate his new time as follows:
\[ 40 \times 0.9 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the volume of tomatoes was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes before cooking = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans needed = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
- In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \(x + 20\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits, we can set up the equation:
\[x + 20 = 25\]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day. The final numerical answer is:

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, Henry baked \( x = 100 \) cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To calculate the final cost after applying the cashback, we first need to determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

To find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times \frac{20}{5} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

However, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this time. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:

\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of water taken on during the 64 seconds rowing time:

\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 64 \text{ feet} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total quantities given. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Given that the total number of parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water) is 120, we can determine the value of one part by dividing the total number of parts by the total number of parts given:

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar corresponds to 7 parts of the ratio, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially counted by the customs officer.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the initial number of vehicles.
3. Use the difference to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 7 = 34 \]
\[ 34 + 8 = 42 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began plus the 20 letters she stamped equals 30. Let's denote the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10

"To determine the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day = 500 people * 0.4 hours/person = 200 hours.

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the total revenue from patients minus the total revenue from doctors:
- Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total revenue from doctors = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation for \( W \):
  \[
  W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q
  \]
- Now, substituting \( W \) and \( B \) in the total number of bees equation:
  \[
  W + B + Q = 4Q + 2Q + Q = 7Q = 700
  \]
- Solving for \( Q \):
  \[
  7Q = 700 \implies Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
  \]
- Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
  \[
  B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is $15, and there is no tax on food items. Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)

Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Time for Steve to bike home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to skateboard home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Tim takes longer to reach his house, he will be the one waiting at his house before Steve finishes the race. The difference in time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

   - Total tires for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
   - Cost per tire = $0.25.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 10 tires * $0.25/tire = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Total tires for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
   - Cost per tire = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
- Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for the unicycle
- Total cost = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cookies per pack} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total number of cookies} \times \text{Cost per cookie} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6.00 \]

Finally, we determine the change Carl receives when he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. An ant then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 20 = 15 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 35.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days in one week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}.\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days in one week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}.\]

Now, we add the hours spent on the days with 3-hour classes and the days with 4-hour classes to find the total number of hours he spends in class each week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}.\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}.\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}
\]"
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this purpose.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. Therefore, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. Therefore, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas required is:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[3000 - 2720 = 280\] yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[280\]"

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Anakin's total:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
- Total for Anakin: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish

Locsin's total:
- Starfish: 5
- Sea horses: 3
- Clownfish: 5
- Total for Locsin: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish

Finally, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after each two-month period, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. The price increase is 20% of the original price, which is:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the price after each two-month period increases by $4. We need to find the price after 36 months, which is 18 two-month periods.

Let's denote the price after \( n \) two-month periods as \( P_n \). The price after the first two months is:
\[ P_1 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

The price after the second two months is:
\[ P_2 = 24 + 4 = 28 \]

The price after the third two months is:
\[ P_3 = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

We can see that the price after each two-month period increases by $4. Therefore, after 18 two-month periods, the price will be:
\[ P_{18} = 20 + 18 \times 4 = 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:

Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Next, we need to find the cost of one red car. The problem states that one red car costs $4. Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:

- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

- The cost of the doll is:

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the necessary 45 eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

According to the problem, Ethel has $8, so:
\[ E = 8 \]

The problem also states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Now, substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total number of miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs contributed by each group of creatures and then sum them up.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and the other bird (Sally Four), and then sum these ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's Age**: The same as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's Age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's Age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- The Caboose (which is implied to be a bird): 4 years (since it is mentioned as a bird and the problem implies a numerical value for it)

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]

So, the total monthly payment Jessica wants to make is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

- Total time in minutes = 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes

Thus, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue is \( \$10x \) and the total cost is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost is:
\[ 3x + 2x = 5x \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10x - 5x \]
\[ 25 = 5x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. Given that the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes and the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"To determine Jean's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Jan's Age**: Jan is 30 years old.
2. **Mark's Age Two Years Ago**: Two years ago, Mark's age was \(M - 2\).
3. **Jan's Age Two Years Ago**: Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
4. **Mark's Age Two Years Ago**: According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
   Solving for \(M\):
   \[
   M = 19 + 2 = 21
   \]
   So, Mark is currently 21 years old.
5. **Jean's Age**: Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's age is:

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll} \mid \text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The combined probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll} \mid \text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 in decimal form.

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the original amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- Total cost including rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and the rate at which he collects peaches.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly consumption of insects for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week to find the daily consumption.

First, the total weekly consumption for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, to find the daily consumption, we divide the total weekly consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net Increase in Trees Each Year**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Number of Trees After 10 Years**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees That Die After 10 Years**

30% of the trees die after 10 years. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years gives:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - The neighbors take back 6 pink flamingos and paint them white.
   - The number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors then put the 6 white flamingos back out.

3. **Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 12 \text{ (remaining pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 30 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **Cards collected in the first month**: She collected three times the initial number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. **Cards collected in the second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. **Cards collected in the third month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards in the third month.

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards from the first month: 60
- Cards from the second month: 40
- Cards from the third month: 200

Total number of cards = \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\).

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Therefore, the total sum of the six test scores needed is:
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. We subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\).

2. **Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\).

3. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   - The total cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   - The cost of each cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Now, let's perform the division to find the cost of each cup.
```python
# Total cost of twenty dozen cups
total_cost_cups = 34800

# Number of cups
number_of_cups = 240

# Cost of each cup
cost_per_cup = total_cost_cups / number_of_cups
cost_per_cup
```
```output
Done
```
The cost of each cup is \( \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\) dollars. Adding the $10 she already has, the total amount of money Sara will have is \(10 + 4x\).

We need this total amount to be at least $70:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides of the inequality:
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amounts of water in the pools are related by the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set the right-hand sides of these equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Rearranging terms to solve for \( S \):
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool, and the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. Let's solve it again with the correct setup:

From \( B = 4S \) and \( B = 2(S - 16) \), we substitute \( B = 4S \) into the second equation:
\[ 4S = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 2S = -32 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Let's verify:
4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons (which is not possible, so we need to recheck the setup again correctly):
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 2S = 32 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 16 \) gallons. Let's verify:
4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 16 - 16 = 0 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons, which is twice the small pool.

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{16} \) gallons."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount. 

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we can find the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles.
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The number of days for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Days:**
   - The total number of days Andrew will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the first batch home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Since each car sells for $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

After adding the tax, the total cost of the cars becomes:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, so for 12 cars, the total registration fee is:
\[ 1,000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Finally, the total amount Mark pays for everything is the sum of the total cost of the cars after tax and the total registration fees:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve's weekly consumption is:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes} \]

And his girlfriend's weekly consumption is:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, their combined weekly consumption is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has initially:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process of making new pens from the empty ones. However, since he only has 5 empty pens now, he can only make one more pen from these 5 empty pens:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, after making the additional pen, Ram will have:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{John's candies} = 2R \]

We are given that John has 54 candies:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on the makeup over the course of the movie.

The makeup artist requires 6 hours each day and needs the makeup done 4 times a week. Therefore, the total hours required per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours required over the entire duration of the movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Jean pays:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 27000 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies. Since she split the cost evenly with her two parents, the total cost is divided among three people. Therefore, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[
96 \div 3 = 32
\]

Each person paid $32. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5600 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys} \]
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ girls} \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since the total number of students in the third class is 20, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as \( W_{\text{last}} \) and the number of cougars killed last night as \( C_{\text{last}} \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ W_{\text{last}} = 10 \]
\[ C_{\text{last}} = 15 \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which we can denote as \( W_{\text{today}} \) and \( C_{\text{today}} \) respectively. We also know that today he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so:

\[ C_{\text{today}} = C_{\text{last}} - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Since today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, we have:

\[ W_{\text{today}} = 3 \times C_{\text{today}} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed by Rick:

\[ \text{Total animals killed} = W_{\text{last}} + C_{\text{last}} + W_{\text{today}} + C_{\text{today}} \]
\[ \text{Total animals killed} = 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total animals killed} = 73 \]

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = \text{Anne's rides} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 21 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites, which ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find the weight of the remaining wood, we calculate 70% of the original weight (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

\[
\text{Weight of the remaining wood} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

First, calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.
- Each book costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the books is \(8 \times 0.50 = 4.00\) dollars.

Next, add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, add the cost of the books to the flat fee:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Flat fee
- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 towards the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan payment from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Thus, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, the total time from starting to heat the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time to cook the chicken:

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

1. **Windows in bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows.
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us \(12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Thus, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 765 \]"
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of packets of tomato seeds: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
\[ \text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of packets of celery seeds: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
\[ \text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400 \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[
\text{Total lines Sean has to memorize} = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{138}

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards}
\]

After removing the 32 cards with the letter A, we have:

\[
80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
\]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards}
\]

After removing the 24 cards with the letter B, we have:

\[
48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
\]

Now, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards}
\]

After removing the 15 cards with the letter C, we have:

\[
24 - 15 = 9 \text{ cards}
\]

The remaining 9 cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of hole separately and then sum these times.

First, calculate the time taken to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the time taken to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

Now, sum the times for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by defining their current ages as \( M \) and \( C \) respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be written as:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

\[ M + C + 10 + 10 = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much length is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads:
- Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
- The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
- Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \).

The final numerical answer is:
68"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

The total value of the coins Kelly has is:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of cents she will have left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of 5-star rows.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. The flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. We can calculate the total number of stars in these rows as follows:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

This means that 36 stars are accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars make up 40 stars. We do this by dividing 40 by 5:

\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are sufficient to transport the 80 flagstones. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the slow lane car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Susan earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount of money she earns is:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Let's sum these up:

\[
15 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

Adding the weekend sales to the weekday sales:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

3. **Third Bid by Carmen**: $250 + $50 = $300
4. **Fourth Bid by Carmen**: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen bids four times in total. Now, we sum up all her bids:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the sum of the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800/year.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper, when folded, can print 4 pages (2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back).

2. **Pages in a 32-page tabloid**: A 32-page tabloid has 32 pages in total.

3. **Calculating the Number of Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper can print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages that can be printed on one piece of paper:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8."
"First, we calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we have:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the amount of money she has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25, we get:

\[
25 - 10 = 15

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Verify the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books sold over the three years should equal the total number of books, which is 250.
   - Books sold in the first year: 400
   - Books sold in the second year: \( x \) (unknown)
   - Books sold in the current year: 200
   - Total books sold:
     \[
     400 + x + 200 = 250
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     600 + x = 250 \implies x = 250 - 600 \implies x = -350
     \]
   - This indicates an inconsistency, suggesting a re-evaluation of the problem constraints. Given the problem's context, it seems the number of books sold in the second year should be consistent with the total books available.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem constraints:**
   - Given the current year's sales are 45 books, and the total books sold over three years should be 250.
   - Books sold in the first year: 400 (as calculated)
   - Books sold in the second year: \( x \)
   - Books sold in the current year: 45
   - Total books sold:
     \[
     400 + x + 45 = 250
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     445 + x = 250 \implies x = 250 - 445 \implies x = -195
     \]
   - This still indicates an inconsistency, suggesting a re-evaluation of the problem constraints.

Given the problem constraints and the provided data, it seems there is an inconsistency. However, if we assume the problem constraints are correct and the number of books sold in the second year is indeed 45, then:

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     45 \times 20 = 900
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beats 16 people. Since he competed against 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since the bakery produces 60 loaves each day and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price for one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price for one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for an arm.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra arms} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing the total days by the growth interval for a leg.
   \[
   \text{Number of extra legs} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   \text{Total new limbs} = 5 + 3 = 8
   \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on his trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the amount he can spend on the trip:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2050 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total egg consumption for a week (7 days):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).

6. **Solve for the current population \(P\):**
   \[
   P / 2 = 60000 \implies P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people had previous commitments.

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet. The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people remaining at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people remaining is 30, the number of women remaining can be calculated by subtracting the number of men remaining from the total number of people remaining:

\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils they have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to account for the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes used is:
\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to account for the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, this will also weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out corresponds to 2 old records traded in, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[
\text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}\):

\[ \text{Time required in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
\]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. Using the same reward system:

\[
\frac{43}{20} = 2.15
\]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they can get $2 off their next purchase.

The customer used their rewards from the previous trip, which is $4 off, and applied a coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the coupon amount is:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount the customer paid after applying the rewards and the coupon. The total amount spent is $43. After applying the $4 rewards, the amount becomes:

\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, the coupon of $8 is applied to this amount:

\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid:

\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the state tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Job B has a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8400 \]"
"First, we need to find the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for Furniture United is:
\[ \text{Total cost for Furniture United} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) \]

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for Cozy Homes is:
\[ \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes} = 1100 + (9 \times 250) \]

Now, let's calculate these values.

For Furniture United:
\[ \text{Total cost for Furniture United} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) = 1350 + 2100 = 3450 \]

For Cozy Homes:
\[ \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes} = 1100 + (9 \times 250) = 1100 + 2250 = 3350 \]

Finally, the cost difference between the two offers is:
\[ \text{Cost difference} = \text{Total cost for Furniture United} - \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes} = 3450 - 3350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to determine the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have combined. We know the following:

- DJ (Jason) has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together gives us the total number of guns:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to divide this total number of guns equally among the four individuals. To find out how many guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by 4:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have \(\boxed{6}\) guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

For the suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, the total sugar required is \( 8 \times 30 \) ounces.

For the fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar required is \( 1 \times 70 \) ounces.

Now, let's perform the calculations:

For the suckers:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

For the fudge:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the sugar required for both:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is 310 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares. She buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares at the end of the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares at the end of the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have the equation:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so:
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

   - Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
- Total weight of the animals: \(50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240\) pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

"First, we calculate the number of outfits Laurel received at her baby shower. Since she received twice the amount of outfits her friend gave her, we multiply 24 by 2:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Next, we add the outfits given by her mom to the total. Her mom gifted her with 15 outfits, so we add 15 to the 48 outfits she received at the baby shower:

\[ 48 + 15 = 63 \]

Finally, we add the 24 outfits given by her friend to the 63 outfits she has after receiving the gifts from her mom:

\[ 24 + 63 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is:

"First, we need to determine how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day, the additional distance he should run is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson runs is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month of June. June has 30 days, so the total distance he runs in June is:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 180000 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractor production:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractor production is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silo production:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silo production is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we first need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do for herself and her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Since she wants to play one round of mini-golf, the cost is $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: She wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens, so the cost is $5.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the cost is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we sum up these costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget for the party is $90. After accounting for the costs of the activities, the remaining budget is:

"First, let's calculate the daily expenditure on lollipops. Marisa buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, her daily expenditure on lollipops is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 100 cents to dollars:

\[ 100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops every day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount of money she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \). According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \). The problem also states that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:

\[ C = 2S - 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city, and then calculate the total distance for three trips. After that, we can determine how many days the train goes between services based on the distance traveled.

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city.
   \[
   \text{Distance from third city to first city} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete round trip:**
   The total distance for one complete round trip (first city to third city and back to first city) is:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for three trips:**
   Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance for three trips is:
   \[
   225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of days between services:**
   The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the total distance by 18,000 and round up to the nearest whole number (since the train needs service after completing the distance, not at the end of each day).
   \[
   \frac{675}{18000} = 0.0375
   \]
   Since 0.0375 days is less than 1 day, the train does not need service within a single day. Therefore, the train goes between services after completing the distance of 675 miles, which is within the first day.

Thus, the train goes between services every day. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. Therefore, the stuffing for a collie bed is:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the overall total:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time John spent driving home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time on the detour, and the time home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 hours to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip time is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \text{ hours} \]"

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters and physical violence offenders:
\[ C + \text{shoplifters} + \text{physical violence} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin now has 24 points and she scored 14 points, the points Erin had before scoring 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment purchased and then calculate the value of the faulty pieces, which can be subtracted from the total cost to find the amount spent on functioning pieces.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of equipment:**
   Let the total number of pieces of equipment be \( N \).

2. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces:**
   Since 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

3. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces:**
   The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces, which is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

4. **Calculate the total cost of the faulty pieces:**
   The cost of each piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \). Therefore, the total cost of the faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.4 \times 400000 = 160000 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   The total cost of the functioning pieces is the total cost of all pieces minus the cost of the faulty pieces, which is \( 400000 - 160000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \( 240000 \).

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of sheep that provide 1 kg of milk each:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep provide 1 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 1 kg of milk is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

2. **Determine the number of sheep that provide 2 kg of milk each:**
   - The other half of the sheep provide 2 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 2 kg of milk is also \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 1 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 1 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

4. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 2 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 2 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

5. **Calculate the total milk collected every day:**
   - Add the milk from both groups of sheep.
   - Therefore, the total milk collected every day is \( 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \).

Next, we find the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the number of apples picked on Monday is 14, and the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday are 12 and 24 respectively, we have:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (\(r\)) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (\(t\)) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Let's compute the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.083333 = 304.1667 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 304.1667 = 3954.1667 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} = \frac{3954.1667}{5} = 790.8333 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 790.83 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for Millie to sell all 36 cups. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time required to sell all 36 cups is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find the profit per hour, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue and then divide by the number of hours the stand is open:
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Hours}} = \frac{\$36 - \$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, the female members decide to perform. However, half of the female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who can make it to the performance is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to join them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who can make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio and then multiplying by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we find the value of one part of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
\[
\text{Popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]
\[
\text{Popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots available is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

First, calculate \( 2 \times 36 \):

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Next, add 20 to 72:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before passing any out is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is:
\[ 43 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and there are 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes has 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes has \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes.

Adding these together, the total number of stripes is:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 3:
\[\text{Average number of stripes} = \frac{88}{3}\]

Calculating the division:
\[\frac{88}{3} = 29.3333...\]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth (if necessary), the average number of stripes is approximately 29.33.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $50.00."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he walked 5,000 steps to and from school.
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, we calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since his goal was to walk 10,000 steps, the number of steps he had left to take before his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words, so the total number of words is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the house as soon as he finishes the book, which will be 30 minutes after he starts reading. He has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the latest time he can leave the house and still make it to the airport on time is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave the house 30 minutes before the latest time he can leave, which is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The final numerical answer is:

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.

So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she was given.

Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver's position and the comb's position.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of \(10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000\) feet (since it fell 4,000 feet from the 10,000 feet elevation).

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

The difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb is \(6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000\) feet.

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{324}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans. He saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
from the jogger jeans, and
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's denote the original cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know that \( T = 28 \) dollars and \( J = T - 6 = 22 \) dollars. The problem asks for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. This can be calculated as:
\[ J - T = 22 - 28 = -6 \text{ dollars} \]

However, since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the jogger jeans actually cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{-6} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ \boxed{570} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the feeders. The feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each feeder she made attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by the feeders. There are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 feeders she made, so the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the feeders she made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final numerical answer is:
150"
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the soup is:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the cake is:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash. The cost of the ticket to the amusement park is $100, so the amount of money he has left after buying the ticket is $50. This means the amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket) - $50 (the amount he has left) = $50.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of guests who would have two hotdogs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

This means that 20 guests would have two hotdogs each, so the caterer prepared:

\[
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer needs to provide an additional 20 hotdogs to satisfy the remaining 20 guests. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 + 20 = 60 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since the caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ guests}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this value, so:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters, and her sister's name has 7 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters is:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
13

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's determine the total amount of money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the items:
- Total cost of items: $19
- Total money Dora has: $18

Money Dora still needs = $19 - $18 = $1

The final numerical answer is $1."
"First, let's determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur as follows:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Since Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter as follows:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Since Prince Walter slew 150 dragons, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce as follows:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gas Josey needed is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} \text{ pints} = \frac{24}{4} \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining amount of money he had after buying the chips is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]

We are told that George had 1% of his money left after buying the chips. This means that the remaining 380 cents is 1% of his original $5. To find out what 1% of $5 is, we calculate:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 1\% = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This confirms that the remaining 380 cents is indeed 1% of $5. Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent 120 cents on chips and had 380 cents left, the amount spent on candy bars is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} - 380 \text{ cents} = 0 \text{ cents} \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it implies no money was spent on candy bars, which contradicts the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the remaining 380 cents is 1% of $5, and thus the total amount spent is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 380 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{120}{75} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \]

Since George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we need to recheck the problem constraints and calculations. Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the correct interpretation and calculation show that George bought 1 candy bar (since 1.6 rounds down to 1 in practical terms).

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. So, each friend received:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Thus, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have a total of 2 pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 2.5 ounces. After Rory and her mom have their pieces, there are 6 pieces left. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs \( 6 \times 2.5 = 15 \) ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than this time to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne. Thus, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne would still mean she arrives 5 minutes before him, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[
  \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[
  \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[
\text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
121 + x = 170 + 10
\]
\[
121 + x = 180
\]
\[
x = 180 - 121
\]
\[
x = 59

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A in minutes is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance covered is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{\$} = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses that can be made is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Finally, we need to determine how many trays can be filled with these 10 glasses of eggnog, given that each tray holds 5 glasses. The number of trays that can be filled is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket minus the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $2. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the original cost per balloon.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.**

The cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, sum the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Since she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies she receives is also \$2400. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 \text{ sapphires} - 3 \text{ sapphires} = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of all her jewels. She now has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. The value of the 5 sapphires is \$4000, and the value of the 2 rubies is \$2400. Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6400}
\]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies with 3 having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies with 4 having spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from aluminum cans + Weekly earnings from plastic bottles
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:
- Total earnings for four weeks = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Thus, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract these from the total number of cards to find out how many cards she gives to her students:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If her students each receive 10 cards, we can determine the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final numerical answer is:

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's denote the total number of kids in Gina's class as \( N = 32 \).

Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy, and \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts. We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy),
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts),
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts).

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids:

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses over five days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, all four horses consume \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:**
   - All four horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - Over five days, they consume \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Calculate the number of bags of oats needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find the number of bags needed, divide the total amount of oats by the amount per bag: \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"To find the number of girl Pomeranian puppies, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of Pomeranian puppies.
2. Calculate one third of the Pomeranian puppies to find the number of girl Pomeranian puppies.

First, we calculate the number of Pomeranian puppies. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the number of Pomeranian puppies by multiplying the total number of puppies by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = 27 \times \frac{2}{3} = 18
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, we multiply the number of Pomeranian puppies by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranian puppies} = 18 \times \frac{1}{3} = 6
\]

Thus, the number of girl Pomeranian puppies Jana has is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum the highest temperatures of each location.
2. Divide the sum by the number of locations (which is 3 in this case).

Let's calculate the sum of the highest temperatures:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

Sum = -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -29 degrees Fahrenheit

Now, we divide the sum by the number of locations:
Average = \(\frac{-29}{3}\)

Calculating the division:
\(\frac{-29}{3} = -9.6667\) (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these 3 countries is \(-9.6667\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to save is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child saves $2 daily. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

Final numerical answer:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the razors before any discounts. Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the buy one get one free offer. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. Thus, the cost for 2 packs with the offer is:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the discounted price:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Heather is buying 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors, so she is buying a total of:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the final numerical answer in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The human pyramid consists of four levels, with the heights of the cheerleaders at each level as follows:

1. Bottom level: 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
2. Second level: 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
3. Third level: 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
4. Top level: 1 cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall.

Let's calculate the total height step by step:

1. **Bottom level:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cheerleaders} \times 64 \text{ inches} = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second level:**
   \[
   3 \text{ cheerleaders} \times 64 \text{ inches} = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third level:**
   \[
   2 \text{ cheerleaders} \times 64 \text{ inches} = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top level:**
   \[
   1 \text{ cheerleader} \times 60 \text{ inches} = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we sum up the heights of all levels to get the total height of the human pyramid:
\[
256 \text{ inches} + 192 \text{ inches} + 128 \text{ inches} + 60 \text{ inches} = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}\):
\[
\frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total height of the human pyramid is:
\[
\boxed{53 \text{ feet}}

"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes each day.

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. Since she works for 480 minutes each day, the number of times she walks is \(480 \div 60 = 8\) times a day (once every hour).

Each time she walks, she walks for 5 minutes. Therefore, in one day, she walks for \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes she has walked is \(40 \times 5 = 200\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.
   - In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age in four years:**
   - According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.
   - Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).
   - Therefore, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is \( 42 - 4 = 38 \).

Thus, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning rides and his afternoon rides separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ morning rides}\).
- The total cost for the morning rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides}\).
- The total cost for the afternoon rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{224}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so the number of insects found by Lily is \( D + 7 \). Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then \( D = \frac{B}{2} \).

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]
Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2D \) in the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]
Now, we know that David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, the number of insects found by Lily is:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
Thus, the number of insects found by Lily is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364\) yards.
- Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364\) yards.

Let's calculate these values:

- Mariah's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91\) yards.
- Her grandma's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182\) yards.

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:

- Total yarn usage: \(91 + 182 = 273\) yards.

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each.

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."

"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from the 2 x 4 pieces. Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from the 2 x 8 pieces. Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since Frederick is buying the cheapest lumber (2 x 4 pieces), he will use the 6 pieces of 2 x 4.

\[
\text{Total sticks from cheapest lumber} = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

\[

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

Thus, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - Let the number of sheep on the farm be \( S \).

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - Let the number of cows on the zoo be \( C \).

3. **Relationships Given:**
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm: \( C = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo: \( S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

4. **Total Animals:**
   - Total animals on the farm = Number of cows + Number of sheep = \( 30 + 10 = 40 \).
   - Total animals on the zoo = Number of cows + Number of sheep = \( 60 + 20 = 80 \).

5. **Combined Total:**

"To determine the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount can be calculated as follows:

\[
4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

So, Ali has a total of $160. He gives half of this amount to his sister:

\[
\frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[
160 - 80 = 80
\]

Next, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

\[
80 - 48 = 32
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, Rob's 2 hours is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate double the time Rob takes to shingle a house:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add 40 minutes to this doubled time to find out how long Royce takes:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren. Then, we multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins required for that item, and finally, we sum up all the skeins needed.

For each grandchild:
- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Now, we calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:
- Hats: \(3 \text{ hats} \times 2 \text{ skeins per hat} = 6 \text{ skeins}\)
- Scarves: \(3 \text{ scarves} \times 4 \text{ skeins per scarf} = 12 \text{ skeins}\)
- Sweaters: \(3 \text{ sweaters} \times 12 \text{ skeins per sweater} = 36 \text{ skeins}\)
- Mittens: \(3 \text{ pairs of mittens} \times 1 \text{ skein per pair} = 3 \text{ skeins}\)
- Socks: \(3 \text{ pairs of socks} \times 2 \text{ skeins per pair} = 6 \text{ skeins}\)

Next, we sum up all the skeins needed:
\[6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins}\]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy \(\boxed{63}\) skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on each day.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Tuesday.

Total problems initially: 100
Problems completed on Monday: 12
Problems completed on Tuesday: 36

Remaining problems after Tuesday:
\[ 100 - (12 + 36) = 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. One-quarter of 52 is:
\[ \frac{52}{4} = 13 \]

So, the number of problems left after Wednesday is:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy:

\[
6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she has available for making the cookies. Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the three recipes (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), each recipe will get:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
\]

Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins available for the cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[
9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12
\]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost before adding the new device: \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device:
- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- New total daily consumption: \( 12 + 2 = 14 \) kilowatts per hour
- New daily cost: \( 14 \times 1.50 = 21 \) dollars

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device:
- Weekly cost before adding the new device: \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars
- Weekly cost after adding the new device: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then scale it up to 5 people.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house}
\]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
2 \text{ days}
\]

Since we need the answer in hours, and there are 24 hours in a day, the total time required is:

\[
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as previously calculated).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is \(42 + 130 = 172\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 80\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 / 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(80 - 21 + 7 = 66\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- \( C = 1100 \)
- \( P = C - 400 \)
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break down the information given:

- There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
- Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, we calculate the number of boys and girls:
- Since the groups are equal, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:
- Each boy brought 60 seashells.
- Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is \(10 \times 60 = 600\).

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$20 - \$2 = \$18
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure and apply it to her sales.

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on top of the initial 30%.

First, let's calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella's total sales were $2500, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = \$1500 \]

The additional commission on the $1500 is:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = 300 + 150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned:
\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case contains 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles required for his guests. Bill has 70 guests, and he wants to provide 2 bottles of water per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he currently has from the total number of bottles required:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given that it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can express the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water as:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can find this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40, and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost for lunch today:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the two totals together to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate its volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate its volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]
\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction in cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \). If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is a known value, the reduction would be \( 5R - 4 \) cups. Given the problem's context and the need for a numerical answer, we can infer that \( R \) is such that the reduction is a specific number of cups. Since the problem does not provide \( R \) and asks for a numerical answer, we can assume \( R \) is such that the reduction is a whole number.

If we assume \( R = 2 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:
\[ 5 \times 2 - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ \boxed{6} \] cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Finally, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours and the angle the pyramid makes with the ground.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle the sun makes with the ground after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle it has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James's sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs a candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many sandwiches are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age. According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the payments Sharon received from the tooth fairy and sum them up.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, the total is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount per tooth as received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each of the last two teeth. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[
\boxed{175}

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) during which he will spend his remaining money on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of repairing the damaged vases.

1. The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
2. The cost of the vaccines is $20 each, and there are 3 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) dollars.
3. The cost of repairing the damaged vases is $12 each, and there are 4 vases, so the total cost for repairing the vases is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[200 + 60 + 48 = 308\]

Therefore, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

Thus, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years.
2. Determine the total amount of money removed from the account over these months.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account.

First, calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:

"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread.
  \[
  \text{Cost of bread} = \$3.00
  \]
- The cost of different cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$30.00}{10} = \$3.00
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = \$3.00 (\text{bread}) + \$3.00 (\text{cheeses and condiments}) = \$6.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. Therefore, the total revenue is:
  \[
  \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00
  \]

Finally, the net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\text{Net profit} = \$70.00 - \$6.00 = \$64.00
\]

Thus, the net profit is:
\[
\boxed{64.00}

\[ 36 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet, and then sum these costs.

First, calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) = 216 \times 14 = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, calculate the cost of the padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot} = 432 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, sum all these costs to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 432 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11664 \, \text{dollars} \]

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we calculate the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \frac{330}{7} = 47.14285714285714 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 47.14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Let's denote the number as \( N \). So, the first operation can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, the second operation can be written as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]

4. **Final Expression**: To find the final value, we need to simplify the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8 = \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \times 8 = \frac{8 \left( 20 + \frac{N}{2} \right)}{5} = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( N \), the final expression in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

However, if we assume \( N \) is the starting value (20), then:
\[
\frac{160 + 4 \times 20}{5} = \frac{160 + 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

Thus, the final value of the number train is:
\[
\boxed{48}

The boy has 5 cards. The brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ cards} \]

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:
- The actual temperature when set to 450 is 468.
- The error is \(468 - 450 = 18\).
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe:
- The error in degrees for 520 degrees is \(520 \times 0.04 = 20.8\).
- The actual temperature she should set the oven to is \(520 + 20.8 = 540.8\).

Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Max will take to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 120 \text{ utensils} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine the three typing speed measurements:

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{a + b + c}{3}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Let's calculate the sum of the three measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

For Cheerios:
- Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
- Weight loss over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

For donuts:
- Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
- Weight gain over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\)

Now, we find the difference in weight:
- Difference in weight: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 2.5 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can express the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as:
\[ \text{Height on day } n = 4 \times 2^{n-1} \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the height exceeds 20 feet:
\[ 4 \times 2^{n-1} > 20 \]

First, divide both sides of the inequality by 4:
\[ 2^{n-1} > 5 \]

Next, we need to find the smallest integer \( n-1 \) such that \( 2^{n-1} > 5 \). We can check the powers of 2:
\[ 2^2 = 4 \]
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]

Since \( 2^2 = 4 \) is less than 5 and \( 2^3 = 8 \) is greater than 5, we have:
\[ n-1 = 3 \]
\[ n = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - The cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - The daily protein intake is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
- One of the implants has an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much more money George needs to pay after his deposit.

- George has already put down a deposit of $600.
- The remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining $3900, given that he earns $15 per hour.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 260 hours."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next 2 hours are:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

"First, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10440000}{145000} \]

\[ \text{Months} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can now convert the number of months into years:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash from dollars to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes she can get from one bottle of shampoo is 120 washes. The cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per wash in dollars, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash in dollars} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

To convert the cost per wash from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ \text{Cost per wash in cents} = 0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter required per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street individually and then find the difference.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' and Monica's streets:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, it costs an additional \(\$65,560\) to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total for initial funding: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period receive the initial funding amount of $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 - 5) receive 50% more funding per month than the initial $100,000.
   - The increased funding per month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - Total funding for the extended 45 months: \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the initial funding and the extended funding: \(100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000\).

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{6850000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces of gum during the school day.} \]

Additionally, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces of gum outside of school.} \]

In total, Jim chews:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces of gum during the day.} \]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces of gum remaining.} \]

He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed. So, he gives:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces of gum to his sister.} \]

After giving 7 pieces to his sister, he has:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the given speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour.

First, we know that:
\[ 1 \text{ Mb} = 1000 \text{ kb} \]

Ashley's internet speed is:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/s} \]

To convert this to megabits per second, we use the conversion factor:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum the results.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. There are 4 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days, which means it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
So, for the remaining 4 days, the tow truck pulled:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we sum the number of cars towed over the entire week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Calculate the number of these riders who are men.
4. Find out how many of these men can stay upright.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]

The remaining riders must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel**: Given as $2000.
2. **Price of a gold jewel**: The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. **Price of a silver jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum the prices of the three jewels to find the total price:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
\]
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we find the total weekly production by adding the total customers processed by both Julie and Jewel:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time required for Bob to dig this volume of earth. It is given that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \text{ seconds} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500 \)
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \)
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Therefore, the total cost for the suits is \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- Therefore, the cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dress pants is \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dress shirts is \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

Finally, let's sum up the total cost:
- The total cost for the suits is $7500.
- The total cost for the dress pants is $1500.
- The total cost for the dress shirts is $1800.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half of the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month was $800.

Next, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. Therefore, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week:

\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Weekly wage} - \text{Amount earned this week} = 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves required is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike reads per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item based on the information provided.

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( s \) be the number of sheep and \( g \) be the number of geese.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. The total number of heads is 20, so we have:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

The total number of legs is 70, so we have:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days based on the information provided.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the last eight days were neutral. This means that the first eight days accounted for 8 good days, and the last eight days accounted for 0 good days. Therefore, the number of good days in the middle eight days is:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

So, the total number of good days is confirmed to be 12. Now, we need to account for the next three days: the first of these is good, the second is neutral, and the third is good. This means that the next three days add 2 more good days to the total. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]
where \( J \) is the number of books Janey has.

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now \(4 + 8 = 12\). At this point, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 12 more dogs than the initial 4 dogs. This is consistent with the current number of dogs being 12.

\[ \text{Current number of dogs} = 12 \]

When James came back, 3 dogs had gone, so the number of dogs reduced to \(12 - 3 = 9\). This means he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for the 3 dogs that left} = 3 \]

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he initially needed for the 8 new dogs and the toys he needs for the 9 remaining dogs.

\[ \text{Total toys needed} = 4 + 9 = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then we can find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes by setting up the following equation:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{3456 \text{ hash browns}}{6}
\]

\[
x = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight that Jack and the 8 other adults will be carrying in the elevator.

The weight of Jack is 80 kg.
The weight of each of the 8 other adults is also 80 kg.

So, the total weight of the 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Next, we find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn, we add the time taken in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We are also given that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + Tr = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (Tr + 7) + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2Tr + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2Tr = 37 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ Tr = \frac{37}{2} = 18.5 \]

Now that we have the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 25.5 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

The total cost of the five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Therefore, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Finally, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we sum the coins saved by Rong and Neil over the ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\) coins.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the fruits in one crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

1. **Red squares**: Given as 14.
2. **Blue squares**: 4 more than the red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: 6 more than the blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: 12 fewer than the green squares.

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2 and the total amount of $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $100, and Julia's share is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of $100.

Calculating Gerald's share:
\[
\text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount of money raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount of money needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Thus, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city.
2. Determine the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes.
3. Subtract the industrial use percentage from the total city use percentage to find the non-industrial use percentage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

Step 2: 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32%.

Step 3: The percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is the total city use percentage minus the industrial use percentage. So, 40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final numerical answer is:
8%"

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is a fixed $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed cost of going picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James incurred from the cost of buying at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she dances with her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
3. The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets, it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[ 450 + 120 + 75 = 645 \]

So, the total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is $645.

Since the pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is:
\[ 450 - 645 = -295 \]

However, since the question asks for the amount of money saved, and the negative value indicates a loss, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches can be converted as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.

Total votes:
\[ 100 \]

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each person has is updated as follows:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of water used for all the cubes combined:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, the amount of water left is:
\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the number of books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Steven has:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, the difference in the number of books Clara has compared to Alice is:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]

Substituting the given cost of a gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

From the problem, we know that \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented as the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We can do this by summing the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom over the course of the week. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

So, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]

Rearranging this equation to solve for the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we need to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we calculate the number of students per group if there are 12 groups:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, which implies we need to find out how many more groups are needed to make the division possible.

To find out how many groups are needed to divide 54 students into groups of equal size, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can divide 54 students into groups of whole numbers. The smallest number of groups that can divide 54 into equal groups is 54 itself (1 group of 54 students), but since we are looking for groups of equal size greater than 1, we consider the next possible number, which is 6 groups (9 students per group).

Since 12 groups are not possible, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can divide 54 into groups of whole numbers. The smallest number of groups that can divide 54 into groups of whole numbers is 6 groups (9 students per group).

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form is:
\[
12 - 6 = 6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.

For a single week:
- Weekday rental: \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.
- Weekend rental: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.
- Total weekly rental: \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total rental for two 4-week months:
- Total rental for one 4-week month: \(4 \times 500 = 2000\) chairs.
- Total rental for two 4-week months: \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20.
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Since the third house needs \( x \) cases, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books, and he decided to read 150 more:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed and Ezra have read together:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for the hours taught on Monday are \(4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300\).
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her additional earnings for Monday are $5.
- Her total earnings for Monday are \( \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \).

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for the hours taught on Wednesday are \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60\).
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.
- Her total earnings for Wednesday are \( \$60 \).

**Total Earnings for the Two Days:**
- Adding the earnings from Monday and Wednesday, we get \( \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \).

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents each day. Since they have 4 vanilla scents available, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/day} \times 1 \text{ day} = 5 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

The company sold 2 fruity scents each day. Since they have 8 fruity scents available, the total number of fruity scents sold is:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/day} \times 1 \text{ day} = 2 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents} - 2 \text{ fruity scents} = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of vanilla scents sold is 3 more than the number of fruity scents sold. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the total revenue from the eggplants is:

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he has already made from the total amount he wants to make:

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine the remaining time after she reads for 3 hours:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer. Subtract the time spent on video games and reading from the total available time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, Tatiana spends 6 hours playing soccer. To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels required for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. A 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means we subtract 20% of $1000 from the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $800."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost of the series movies: Since a third of the movies are in series and he can get them for $6 each, the cost is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost of the older movies: Since 40% of the remaining movies are older and each costs $5, the cost is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost of the other movies: Since the other 240 movies cost $10 each, the cost is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4400 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by its respective price per pound and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points Ava earns are:
\[ \text{Points}_A = 10 \times E_A + 5 \times B_A + 30 \times (-4) \]
\[ \text{Points}_A = 10 \times (E_E + 8) + 5 \times (B_E + 3) + 30 \times (-4) \]
\[ \text{Points}_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Points}_A = 10E_E + 5B_E - 25 \]

The points Emma earns are:
\[ \text{Points}_E = 10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 30 \times (-4) \]
\[ \text{Points}_E = 10E_E + 5B_E - 120 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Points}_A - \text{Points}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_E + 5B_E - 25) - (10E_E + 5B_E - 120) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10E_E + 5B_E - 25 - 10E_E - 5B_E + 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 95 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is 95 points."

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip each day. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance he travels in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented to avoid the pipes freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees or above. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - \text{Night temperature} \]
\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{\text{Temperature increase needed}}{\text{Temperature increase per log}} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he collects and then convert that into dollars.

First, we calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien collects in a 30-day month:
\[ \text{Total bottle caps} = \text{Number of bottle caps per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total bottle caps} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \]

Next, we convert the total number of bottle caps into dollars. Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Total bottle caps} \times \text{Value per bottle cap} \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 300 \times 0.25 = 75 \]

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her regular 8 hours of work and for the additional 3 hours she worked.

For the regular 8 hours:
\[ \text{Payment for regular hours} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the additional 3 hours:
\[ \text{Payment for additional hours} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the payments for the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total payment for the day:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left, subtract the discounted price from $50:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. The total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"
"To find the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" and then sum them up.

""Deck the Halls"" is played twice, so the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

""Jingle Bells"" is played once, so the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
\[ 240 \text{ seconds} \]

Adding these two durations together gives the total caroling time:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initial hourly wage: $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, the hourly wage increases by $0.50, so the new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
- On his first anniversary, the hourly wage increases by another $1.00, so the new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (24 hours), his hourly wage is $10 per hour.
- For the remaining 4 hours, his hourly wage is $11.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Billy = (24 hours * $10/hour) + (4 hours * $11.50/hour) = $240 + $46 = $286.

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
- Total earnings for Sally = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $286 - $210 = $76.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{76}
\]"

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ \text{Trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ \text{Trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ \text{Total trees planted} = 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week, we get:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost before the premium is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Total number of students tested = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students tested}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Converting this to a percentage, we get 70%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:
\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, Dale had 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies.
3. After selling 150 candies, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left, which means he had sold more than he initially had. This indicates that he had to order more to meet the demand.
4. He then ordered 100 more candies, bringing his total back to 100 + 100 = 200 candies.
5. Now, he needs to sell 200 candies to sell all of his candy.

Since he has already sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially picked:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes with one quarter.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes with one quarter.

Next, let's convert the total play time from hours to minutes:
- They play for 4 hours, which is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total play time contributed by each person:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The friend who can play for 10 minutes plays for 10 minutes.
- The friend who can play for 30 minutes plays for 30 minutes.

The total play time is:
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we need to determine how many quarters are used for 240 minutes of play:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the time walked on both days from hours to minutes.
4. Sum the total time in minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the hours walked on both days into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3\)

Let's calculate the total:

\[5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be shipped 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose. This is the cost of the book minus the refundable amount:
\[ \$32.00 - \$24.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after receiving money from her father:

Mulan's initial amount: $40
Money given by her father: $100

Total money after receiving from her father: $40 + $100 = $140

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 * $30 = $60
Cost of the bag: $20

Total cost of the items: $60 + $20 = $80

Finally, let's calculate how much money Mulan has left after purchasing the items:

Money left: Total money after receiving from her father - Total cost of the items
Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First week production**: 8,000 bars
2. **Second week production**: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third week production**: Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, we sum the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, and the base installation includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
- Angela needs 2 chandeliers, and the base installation includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, and the base installation includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs 10 additional pictures.

The cost for the additional items is calculated as follows:
- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times \$15.00 = \$30.00\)
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times \$15.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times \$15.00 = \$150.00\)

Adding these costs together gives:
\[ \$30.00 + \$15.00 + \$150.00 = \$195.00 \]

Next, we add the base installation cost to the additional items cost:
\[ \$129.00 + \$195.00 = \$324.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is:
\[ \boxed{324.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. Therefore, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

\[ \text{40\% of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \, \text{miles} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. After trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]
So, the reduced price of the laptop is $400.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 400 + 50 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 450 \]
To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract $230 from $450:
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 450 - 230 = 220 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam decides to slice 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam decides to slice 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

"To determine the total number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at both math and English, as well as those who are only good at math.

Given:
- Total students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students performing well in English only = 8

The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Therefore, we first find the number of students who are good at both subjects:
\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students performing well in English only}) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - 13 \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then add the intermission time. The total time for one group is:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes (setup)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performance)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The intermission time is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for one group including the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a percentage, we need to convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:

\[ 225\% = \frac{225}{100} = 2.25 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

The total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( S + B + M + T = 87 \).

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, we can rewrite the sum of our ages equation as:
\[ S + B + (3B - 1) + (S - 2) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B = 90. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S + 2B = 45. \]
From the first relationship \( S = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B - 3 = 45. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to provide at least 54 glue sticks, given that each pack contains 8 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we can check the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:
\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount it had on the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:
\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, after Day 3, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:
\[ \boxed{3430} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \text{ meters/second} \]"
"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. Therefore, the total cost for her daily diet is:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns in the first two weeks is:
\[ x + 3x + x + 5x = 10x \]

Given that she earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and assuming she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ 6x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month were $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns must be:
\[ 6x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) into the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6x = 6 \]

Thus, the earnings from mowing lawns were $6. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ 80 - 6 = 74 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 74 \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total amount of money he earns from renting his car minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer for John's profit is:

\[ 250 \]

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month."
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's total notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate the distance Anis rowed:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

- Yesterday:
  - Denise read 10 pages.
  - Daniel read 13 pages.

- Today:
  - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
  - Daniel read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the number of pages Denise read today:
- Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:
- Denise's total pages: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total pages: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining 2 bowls of soup will be for the two children.

Given that the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have 2 bowls of soup left for the children, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup.

"To calculate the total amount William spent, we need to multiply the cost of the notebooks by the number of notebooks he bought and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding these together gives the total material required:
- Total material = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age (\( D \)) was two times Adam's age four years ago (\( A \)).
4. Therefore, we can write the equation: \( D = 2A \).

Substituting the value of \( D \) from the first piece of information:
\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 8 = 34 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since there are 27 cups in total and she uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are for chamomile and mint tea:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea combined. Since she divides these cups into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can let \( x \) be the number of cups of chamomile tea and \( x \) be the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea can be expressed as:

First, let's break down the information given:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ berries} \]

So, the sloth picks up 12 berries in 4 hours. To find out how many berries he picks up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ \text{Number of berries per trip} = \frac{12 \text{ berries}}{1 \text{ trip}} = 12 \text{ berries per trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn, so the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- A box of candy costs $2.
- Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from his total monthly budget:
- Colby's monthly budget is $150.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, the remaining budget is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10 per movie. We need to find out how many movies he can see with $126, considering he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days.

The total number of movies he has already seen is:
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday.
- 8 movies on other days.
- Total movies seen so far: \(5 + 8 = 13\) movies.

The number of movies he can see with the remaining budget is:
- The remaining budget is $126.
- Each movie costs $10.
- The number of movies he can see is \(\frac{126}{10} = 12.6\).

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
- Movies already seen: 13.
- Additional movies he can see: 12.
- Total movies: \(13 + 12 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which means she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 \text{ (total toys now)} - 48 \text{ (toys before)} = 14 \text{ bouncy balls} \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff. Therefore, the total number of boxes donated is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. Therefore, the total number of boxes available is:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

3. The number of tables needed to fit 60 boxes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

4. The number of new tables needed is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and hourly widget production and sales revenue for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets/month} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets/month} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue: \(\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800\)

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 12-hour stay plus additional hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1600 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for this option is 1600 + 350 = 1950 pesos.

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components to find the total charge:

Total charge = Fixed visit fee + Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission from NYT} + \text{Commission from WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find Leo's age, we can start by determining Marcus's age based on the information given. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

First, calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Leo's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, we can solve for Leo's age by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
From the first equation, we can substitute \( B \) in the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D + 20 = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D = 25 \]
Now, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the second equation:
\[ D = B - 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = (A + 20) - 10 \]
\[ D = A + 10 \]
Now we substitute \( D = A + 10 \) into the equation \( 2A + D = 25 \):
\[ 2A + (A + 10) = 25 \]
\[ 3A + 10 = 25 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. To verify, we can find the points scored by Bahati and Dinar:
\[ B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \]
\[ D = A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \]
Adding these points together:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]
The total is correct, so the number of points Azibo scored is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

1. Calculate the total time in hours:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

2. Convert the total time into minutes:
   - 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

3. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
   - 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

4. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, in 60 intervals, he can staple 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

The final numerical answer is 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she spent on the bed before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 2:38 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours and } 17 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 17 \text{ minutes} = 197 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time spent not on her bed**: Adding the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 197 \text{ minutes} = 220 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time spent on her bed**: Subtracting the total time not spent on her bed from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 220 \text{ minutes} = 260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 260 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) measuring cups.

The number of measuring spoons Jonathan has is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:
\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:
\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9 emails) are sent to her family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends 6 emails to her family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These 3 emails are not work emails and not sent to her family. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the third day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8
- Holes filled on the third day: 2

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \). According to the problem, \( H_1 = 29 / 4 = 7.25 \). Since the number of holes must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the context. The problem likely implies that the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (since 29 is not divisible by 4, and the context suggests a whole number).

So, \( H_1 = 7 \).

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \).

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 + 2 = 1 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions provided.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number received by Amora and Lainey, which is \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

Now, we sum the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[
70 + 70 + 85 = 225
\]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"First, we need to determine the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of episodes per minute:**
   Each episode is 20 minutes long.

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then account for the ones eaten and given away.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, 4 dozen brownies were waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the brownies Greta had initially and subtract the ones eaten.

Total brownies initially:
\[
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

Brownies eaten:
\[
18 \text{ brownies}

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Cost of the fourth phone: $300

Adding these together:
\[ 600 + 600 + 300 + 300 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Given that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats \( S \) required is:

\[ S = 2 \times P \]
\[ S = 2 \times 50 \]
\[ S = 100 \]

Thus, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had, which is 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. She gave each 2 boxes, so:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that represents:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of states in both India and the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

To find the total number of states, we need the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA. Without this information, we can only express the total number of states in terms of \( x \).

If we assume the problem intends a specific number of states in the USA, let's assume the USA has 50 states (a common assumption for this type of problem). Then:
\[ x = 50 \]

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19, he will turn 24 in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil will be 24 years old, so his brother will be \( 24 / 2 = 12 \) years old. Since this will happen in 5 years, his brother is currently \( 12 - 5 = 7 \) years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads} \]

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we can find the total number of beads Adrianne has by adding the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times \text{Size of Sophie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their individual shoe sizes and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Therefore, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total space taken by plants and spaces} = 111 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (111 - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 111 \text{ feet} + 110 \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 111 \text{ feet} + 165 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 276 \text{ feet} \]

Since the flower bed is only 111 feet long, it is clear that Pat cannot fit 111 plants with 1.5 feet between each plant. We need to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the 111 feet, considering the 1.5 feet spacing.

Let \( n \) be the number of plants. The total space taken by \( n \) plants and the spaces between them is:

\[ n + (n - 1) \times 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ additional plants} \]

The cost of each plant is $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will incur, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sauteing are independent, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the two times:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine the final temperature of the room relative to its starting temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -2 degrees
   - Total change in temperature: -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -3 degrees
   - Total change in temperature: -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: +2 degrees
   - Total change in temperature: +2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = +4 degrees

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Total change in temperature = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the second time 75 years after he saw it for the first time. Therefore, we can determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time} = 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. **Church**: Twice per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Quarterly, which means 4 times per year, so 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum these up:

\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks per year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{2}F = 44 \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France made by the first plane. Since the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \), we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl lasts \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous's howl lasts \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother. Therefore, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money they gave him:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

Total donations from others: $500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) + $200 (friend) = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the total donations from others:

Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ V = 2 \cdot 2x + 4 \cdot x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds from minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and the time spent on appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:

- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[
\frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[
\frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[
16 - 8 = 8

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

Substituting the volume in cubic feet:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = G \times 0.10 \]

Substituting the volume in gallons:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. The number of red sticks is given as 9.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color:
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = 34 \]

"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and female students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.609841 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.609841 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.609841 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.609841 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817473 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.609841 \times 0.817473 \approx C \times 0.4984 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.4984 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.4984} \approx 0.5625 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 56.25%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56.25} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the cost of these fruits:
Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% annually, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures, but we don't need to know the exact number of those for this calculation.

First, let's calculate the number of pictures in the albums dedicated to selfies and portraits:

- Number of selfies = 3 albums * x pictures/album
- Number of portraits = 2 albums * y pictures/album

Since the total number of pictures is 72, and the remaining 3 albums are for other types of pictures, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3x + 2y + \text{other pictures} = 72 \]

However, since we don't have information about the ""other pictures,"" we can simplify by focusing on the selfies and portraits:

\[ 3x + 2y = 72 \]

Given that the number of pictures in each album is the same, we can denote the number of pictures per album as \( n \). Therefore:

\[ 3n + 2n = 72 \]
\[ 5n = 72 \]

This equation does not yield an integer solution for \( n \), indicating that the number of pictures per album must be consistent across all albums. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and there are 8 albums, the number of pictures per album is:

\[ n = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we can find the number of selfies and portraits:

- Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27
- Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is 60 minutes."
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
- 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). So, 30 new guests checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. After 24 guests checked out early: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. After 15 guests checked out late: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. After 30 new guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. After 7 more guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To determine the total number of bananas John picks, we need to calculate the number of bananas picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:

- Number of average questions: \( \frac{60 - 24}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
- Number of difficult questions: \( 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

Finally, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this expression:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling the cookies and cupcakes.

Earnings from cookies = Number of cookies sold × Price per cookie
Earnings from cookies = 80 × $1
Earnings from cookies = $80

Earnings from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes sold × Price per cupcake
Earnings from cupcakes = 60 × $4
Earnings from cupcakes = $240

Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes
Total earnings = $80 + $240
Total earnings = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of:
Total given away = $10 × 2
Total given away = $20

Money left = Total earnings - Total given away
Money left = $320 - $20
Money left = $300

The final numerical answer is $300."
"The Smith twins found a total of \(30 + 30 = 60\) eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by their friends is \(100 - 60 - 10 = 30\).

The friends found \(\boxed{30}\) eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves working for 30 days.

1. **Determine the daily ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.
   - 40 dwarves working together mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total monthly ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - 40 dwarves working together mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds of ore in a month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportionality between the number of sandwiches and the price. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( P \).

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find \( P \) by multiplying the number of sandwiches in the third package by the price per sandwich:
\[
P = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% or 0.60 (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension, he has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, this sum exceeds 100%, which indicates that the scenarios overlap. We need to account for the overlap, which is the probability of the normal teacher scenario where Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate the assignment:

- Probability of the normal teacher scenario and Marcus convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20

So, the adjusted probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 - 0.20 = 0.90 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.90 \times 100 = 90\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90\% \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to split these 5750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round 6.052631578947368 to 6.

Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is \( 3 \times 150 = 450 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]
The ""+1"" is necessary because we need to include the first bottle at the start of the driveway.

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, the time to go from the first bottle to the second, the second to the third, and so on, up to the eighth bottle is:
\[
7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples each can be made from these 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the cost of the mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \).

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
- The amount of money left is \( \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and worked the entire time.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out:
- Jim took out $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- If he had worked for 4 years without going to college, his total income would be $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During college, Jim's income is tripled, so his income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.
- Total income during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college and worked for 4 years:
- Total income without college = $100,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had gone to college:
- Total income with college = $300,000 (income during college) + $200,000 (total loan amount) = $500,000.

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn the equivalent of $500,000 if he had not gone to college and worked the entire time:
- Without college, Jim would have earned $100,000 over 4 years.
- To earn $500,000, the time required would be:
  \[
  \frac{500,000}{100,000} \times 4 = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ years}
  \]

So, it would take Jim 20 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, Wednesday's delivery is:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ 736 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The final numerical answer is $101.00."
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. Therefore, Johnny's dad lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (win)
- Third race: $16.50 (loss)

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\$21.50}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \$7.1667 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss per race is $7.17.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.17 \]"
"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then by the number of people per city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 26 \times 5 = 130 \]
\[ 130 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since they worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day, the total number of hours worked in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \div 4 = \frac{63}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours} \]

Converting \( \frac{63}{32} \) to a decimal gives:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year to the initial price of $20,000 for the three years between 2007 and 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P \approx 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the additional cost as follows:
\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this additional cost to the normal monthly cost gives us the total monthly cost:
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:

"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Finally, the total number of pizzas left is the sum of the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
24"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we divide by 2 to find the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound:
   \[
   \text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for all sets:**
   Since there are 3 sets, the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00/\text{set} = \$12.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the movie theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, the number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

Now, we calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:

- Additional cost = 21 guests * $6/guest = $126.

Finally, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost to find the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially, so \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas} \]

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. He then finished another 500-piece puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is the sum of the pieces from both puzzles:

\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change Jenny receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Revenue from milkshakes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of milkshakes} = 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per milkshake} = \$5.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).

Now, we need to determine the time Paul will wait for the fourth train. The fourth train arrives at 85 minutes, and Paul will board it at that time. Therefore, Paul will wait 0 minutes for the fourth train.

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price of the watch was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on it.

"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. The store is 4 miles away from his home, so he walked 4 miles to get halfway there, and then he had to walk back 4 miles to get home, and then he walked 4 miles again to get to the store. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 4 \text{ miles (to halfway)} + 4 \text{ miles (back home)} + 4 \text{ miles (to the store)} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 12 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \) dollars
- Earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John attends each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John attends \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John attends 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - He spends 1600 minutes in class and 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

6. **Convert the total number of minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings of the orchard, we first need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling the apples."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which is \( \frac{x}{4} \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The friend can choose any one of the 6 unshaken sodas or any one of the 2 shaken sodas. The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day.

Total hours worked = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between the two slides is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch time per day: 30 minutes
- Break time per day: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, calculate the total time spent over 5 days:
Total time over 5 days = Total time per day * Number of days
Total time over 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
Total time in hours = Total time in minutes / 60
Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return amount: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 - (0.20 \times 20.00) = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 - (0.10 \times 30.00) = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{T}{15} = 6 \).

We can solve for \( T \) as follows:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year and then figure out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to determine how many more years she needs to work beyond the initial 20 years to reach the total of 40 years.

\[
\text{Additional years needed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ years}

"Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \). According to the problem, 40% of the total students are boys, and this number is given as 240. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find the total number of students \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ T = 600 \]

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since the total number of students is 600 and 40% of them are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times T \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents.

First, we need to find the distance for a one-way trip. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time for one-way trip = 2 hours

So, the distance for a one-way trip is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 2 \times \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The four workers work for a 10-hour shift:
- In 10 hours, the first four workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order:
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
- \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
- The production rate of the fifth worker is \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away to Rob, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. The final numerical answer is:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( L \) be Liam's current age and \( V \) be Vince's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Liam is currently 16 years old, so \( L = 16 \).
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old, and Vince was \( V - 2 \) years old. According to the problem, \( 14 = 2(V - 2) \).

Now, we solve the equation \( 14 = 2(V - 2) \):

\[
14 = 2(V - 2)
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
7 = V - 2
\]

Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( V \):

\[
V = 9
\]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box contains 8 ounces of crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces is equal to 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their mother's monthly salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, we can calculate the distance she covers on the beach as:
\[ \text{Distance on the beach} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 40v \text{ miles} \]

Since the total distance on the beach is 2 miles, we have:
\[ 40v = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles \( x \):

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring out 4 ounces. Since the temperature of the water does not change with the amount poured out, the temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the second mug after pouring out 1 ounce. The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug is \( T \) degrees.

Now, we need to find the average temperature of the water in the water bottle after Donny pours the water. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the water in the water bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from the two mugs:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial number of cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial number of chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the discounted total cost is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell receives with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 18 scoops is 9 times 2 scoops (because \(18 \div 2 = 9\)), we need 9 times the number of potatoes required for 2 scoops. Therefore, the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

First, calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Finally, subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \) and the number collected by Carrey as \( K \). According to the problem, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 27 = C + 5 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so:

\[ C = 2K \]

Since we already found \( C = 22 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 22 = 2K \]

Solving for \( K \):

\[ K = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells, Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. The total number of seashells collected is:

\[ 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among the three of them, so each person received:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles are required:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The additional bottles needed are:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100\% = \frac{200}{3}\% \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

The final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each transaction:
- From the first transaction: $50
- From the second transaction: $30
- From the remaining land: \(20 \text{ square meters} \times 3 \text{ dollars/square meter} = 60 \text{ dollars}\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total money Abraham earned:
\[50 + 30 + 60 = 140\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of face masks used per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - For each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - For 2 days, he uses \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ masks/day} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 3 collections per week:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:

\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Ronnie was given $5, so \( R_n = 5 \). Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so \( R_r = 3 \times R_n = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]
So, we have:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Since Ronnie initially had $5 and he gave $3 to his sister, the amount left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

It is also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can write the equation for the total paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values and relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can find the total area of the house by summing the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

Therefore, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box of dishwasher pods for $1, given that each pod lasts one cycle.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box contains 100 pods. Therefore, the new box contains:

\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle costs $1. Since each pod lasts one cycle and the new box costs $12 for 120 pods, we can run:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ cycles per dollar} \]

Therefore, with the new box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The chalk used is 45% of 5 inches, which is \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.
   - Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the amount of chalk used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - On Tuesday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Tuesday is \(2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20\) inches.
   - On Wednesday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Wednesday is \(2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76\) inches.
   - On Thursday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Thursday is \(1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408\) inches.
   - On Friday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Friday is \(1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264\) inches.
   - On Saturday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Saturday is \(1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112\) inches.
   - On Sunday, the teacher will use \(0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224\) inches of chalk.
   - The chalk remaining after Sunday is \(0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896\) inches.

3. **Determine the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the chalk:**
   - The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - The chalk remaining after Sunday is 0.720896 inches, which is less than 2 inches.
   - Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 7 days.

"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. Therefore, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[
\text{Amount returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the milk was sold at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The values satisfy both equations, confirming that Colin is currently 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total and that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can calculate the number of $500 units in $27,000 and then multiply by 100.

The number of $500 units in $27,000 is:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes this amount of money between 3 schools, so the number of books he can buy per school is:

\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"To solve this problem, we need to account for the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, the net rate of snowballs Jay gets is:

\[ \text{Net rate} = \text{Rate of building} - \text{Rate of melting} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} \]

To find a common denominator, we can use 15:

\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15} \]

So the net rate becomes:

\[ \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \]

This means Jay gets 1/5 of a snowball per minute. To find out how long it takes to get 60 snowballs, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Time} \times \frac{1}{5} = 60 \]

Solving for time:

\[ \text{Time} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they should have \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left after ordering.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means they must have had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages at the end of the second day.

So, at the end of the second day, they had 103 bandages. This means they used \(103 - 22 = 81\) bandages on the second day, which is consistent with using 28 bandages on the second day and ordering 50 bandages on the first day.

Now, let's find out how many bandages they started with on the first day. We know they had 50 bandages at the end of the first day after using 38 and ordering 50. So, they must have started with \(50 + 38 = 88\) bandages on the first day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final numerical answer is 100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives the $10 bonus for complete attendance.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount he earns for that task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each instance. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each instance. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each instance. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each instance. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

The final numerical answer is 320."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of black pens were bought. According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. Therefore, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one makeup set. Therefore, the number of colors left after using up half of one makeup set is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by dividing the capacity of Ali's class by 8:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount minus the amount paid over the 11 months:

   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the expected number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Expected number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim was 36 jelly beans off his guess. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **Number of passengers who entered at the third stop**: The number of passengers doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Total number of passengers after the third stop**: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of passengers who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.
   - Over the next 3 years, the total cost for these visits is \(3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total amount spent over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. **Total number of students in grades 4-7:**
   - Each grade has 10 students.
   - There are 3 grades (4, 5, and 6).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students.

2. **Number of students per group:**
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.

3. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Total students = 30
   - Students per group = 8
   - Number of groups = 30 students / 8 students/group = 3.75 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means 4 groups are needed.

4. **Time each group spends:**
   - Each group spends 45 minutes.

5. **Total time required:**
   - Number of groups = 4
   - Time per group = 45 minutes
   - Total time = 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. Converting 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 180 minutes = 3 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 3 hours."

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the roof frames. John manufactured 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the total cost for the roof frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out the total amount Ali has to pay John, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the cost of the roof frames:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of meat needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, the total amount of seasoning needed for 5 pounds of meat is:

\[
\text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the relationship:

\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

This means the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined is 10:

\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:

\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:

\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:
- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine sends one issue per year, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is equal to the total number of issues:
\[ 66 \text{ magazines} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 66 \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25% for veterans).
- The reduced rate is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
- Total earnings = earnings from standard lessons + earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = \(320 + 120 = 440\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is:

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. The number of apples given to his sister is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

The number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days. Given that he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to determine the total time he spends traveling.

Assuming Michael travels every day without any rest days, the total time he spends traveling in 3 days is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance he travels in these 72 hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline. She ate 6 grapes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used by her brother to make the grape juice. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of grapes:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Thus, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the interpretation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all the classrooms. This means they cannot complete the cleaning in the given 5 days if they work 8 hours a day. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, which is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \times 100 = 250\% \]

But since the custodian cannot work 250% of a day, the correct interpretation is that they need more than one day to complete the cleaning. The percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 250\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all four shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$2.40 = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per dollar}} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats:**
   Skyler has 100 hats in total, and half of them are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   Three-fifths of the remaining 50 hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. Normally, a bag of beef jerky costs $18.00, but it is currently $3.00 off, so the cost will be:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. The total number of ice cubes is \( S + B = 116 \).

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 3 marbles plus the 5 he didn't lose, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into the steps he needs to follow:

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, he needs 8 customers to ensure he meets his goal.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

Thus, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus. The final numerical answer is:

\[
200

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- For the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- For the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used, we add the total number of flashlights and the total number of candles:
\[20 + 36 = 56\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim spends dealing with calls in a single day. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we need to convert the hours into minutes to make the calculation easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calls he deals with during a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
\[2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}\]

Therefore, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to first establish the cost of each additional phone. Given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone costs $20, we can calculate the cost of each additional phone as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of each additional phone} = \frac{\text{Cost of the main phone}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the total cost of the additional phones is:

\[ \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 4 \times \text{Cost of each additional phone} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the phone plan:

\[ \text{Total cost of the phone plan} = \text{Cost of the main phone} + \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

"To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos uploaded per day.
2. Determine the number of days required to upload all 210 photos.

First, we know that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first determine the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

The weekly cost for Alicia's clothes is calculated as follows:
- Cost for blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00
- Cost for skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Adding these together gives the weekly cost:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

To find the cost over 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, the final numerical answer is $235.00."
"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people Conor saw each day and then find the total for the week.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which is \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people Conor saw on the remaining days of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days). We know that the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the four days is \(60 \times 4 = 240\).

Let's denote the number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) respectively. We know that:
\[x + y + z = 240\]

Since we don't have specific information about \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), we can assume they are distributed in a way that fits the average, but we can also calculate the total number of people seen over the week by summing up the people seen each day.

The total number of people seen over the week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + x + y + z\]

Since \(x + y + z = 240\), the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500\]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{500}

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will break down the problem into the four time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels / 30 seconds = \(\frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - New rate = \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - New rate = \(4 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{8}{3} \times 30 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate halves the previous rate.
   - New rate = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{4}{3} \times 30 = 40\).

Now, we sum the number of kernels that popped in each interval:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding these to the total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade:
- Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
- Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

Next, determine the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice:
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 4 cups, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Now, consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 6 lemons for this extra gallon.

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
- Total lemons needed = 24 (for 4 gallons) + 6 (for the extra gallon) = 30 lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

- Time traveled west = 5 hours
- Distance west = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled east = 8 hours
- Distance east = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, determine the net distance from the starting point:
- Distance west = 90 miles
- Distance east = 144 miles
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700

"To find the average of their ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average is given by the sum of their ages divided by 2 (since there are two people).

Sum of their ages = Mia's age + Emma's age = 40 + 56 = 96

Average of their ages = \(\frac{96}{2} = 48\)

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to determine the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

The total number of seashells found is:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells. Since 67 of these were cracked, the number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of good seashells:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 665 \]"
"To determine the total cost Avery will spend on the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one complete place setting and then multiply by the number of place settings needed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$180.00 \]"
"First, we need to determine the time it took Steve to complete the puzzle. According to the problem, Steve took 10 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle. The problem states that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Anna's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Steve's time} + 2
\]

Substituting Steve's time (10 hours) into the equation:

\[
\text{Anna's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 + 2
\]

\[
\text{Anna's time} = 5 + 2
\]

\[
\text{Anna's time} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- The pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in a week.
- Therefore, the amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since there are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

For the cookies:
- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both cupcakes and cookies:
- Total revenue = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of food:
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost for trays = 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, let's determine how much money Frances has left after accounting for the cost of the trays:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the initial number of meals she had.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's perform the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals left to distribute is 1,218."

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the time she spends meditating in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks contain \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. Therefore, the total time spent meditating in 4 weeks is \(28 \times 30 = 840\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga. She practices yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) every day she practices yoga, and she practices yoga 5 days a week. So, in one week, she spends \(5 \times 60 = 300\) minutes on yoga. Over 4 weeks, she spends \(4 \times 300 = 1200\) minutes on yoga.

Finally, to find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we add the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga:
\[840 + 1200 = 2040\]

So, the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get \(2040 \div 60 = 34\) hours.

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price. The discounted price for the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends:

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:

"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in one week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings in 2 weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of days Josh works in one week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works on 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in one week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we determine his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that the dog is still digging 6 - 9 = -3 holes per day, meaning the number of holes increases by 3 holes per day. We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The net change in the number of holes after \( d \) days is \( 3d \). We need this net change to be equal to the total number of holes dug, which is 84:

\[ 3d = 84 \]

Solving for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{84}{3} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:

First, let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles and the distance Vanessa ran as \(d_V\) miles. According to the problem, \(d_V = 4\) miles.

Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's speed is \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \(2v_V\) miles per minute. The time it took Aaron to run his part of the race is given as 16 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation for the distance Aaron ran as:
\[ d_A = \text{Aaron's speed} \times \text{time} = 2v_V \times 16 = 32v_V. \]

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we have:
\[ d_V = 2d_A. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 4 = 2 \times 32v_V = 64v_V. \]
Solving for \(v_V\), we find:
\[ v_V = \frac{4}{64} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}. \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. The time \(t_V\) it took Vanessa to run 4 miles is given by:
\[ t_V = \frac{d_V}{v_V} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}. \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. Given that he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Currently, he has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total revenue per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total revenue per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total revenue per week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine the current age of James and Dora.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

James is now twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine the current age of John. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find the current age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]

In 3 years, the youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\) oranges.

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
