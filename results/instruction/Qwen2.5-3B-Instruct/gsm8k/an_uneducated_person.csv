"First, let's calculate how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs.

So, the number of eggs left for the market is:
16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining eggs at $2 each.

Therefore, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is:
9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

So, the final numerical answer is $18."
"If a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, then it takes half that much, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together: 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The house's value increased by 150% of its original value. The original value of the house was $80,000.

To find 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000 \]

So, the increased value of the house is:
\[ \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the repairs to the increased value to find the total selling price:
\[ \$200,000 + \$50,000 = \$250,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original house price plus repairs) from the selling price:
\[ \$250,000 - (\$80,000 + \$50,000) = \$250,000 - \$130,000 = \$120,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \$120,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints a day, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in a day, he runs:
3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week

So, the final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since she has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for the whole flock is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- This pattern continues, with every second glass costing $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which means he needs to buy 8 pairs of glasses.

The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses."
"If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston, which has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, will have:
4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse will have:
2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

So, the final numerical answer is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. Since the file is 200 GB and she has downloaded 40% of it before the restart, we calculate:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

This means she has 120 GB left to download after the restart. Normally, she can download 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it takes to download the remaining 120 GB, we divide:

\[ 120 \text{ GB} \div 2 \text{ GB/minute} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she had to restart the download after the 20-minute Windows update, we add this time to the 60 minutes:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he already spent 3.5 hours (3 hours + 0.5 hours), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance he covers in the last 0.5 hours at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding up all the distances, we get the total distance John has traveled:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 235 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"Eliza worked 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour and 5 hours at her overtime rate, which is 1.2 times her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times (1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour}) = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, let's add both amounts to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are \$460."
"First, let's calculate the number of downloads in the second month. If the first month had 60 downloads and the second month had three times as many, then:

\[ \text{Downloads in second month} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. So, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:

\[ \text{Reduction} = 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \]
\[ \text{Downloads in third month} = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:

\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

- Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
- Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type:

- Cost of donuts = 3 dozen * $68 per dozen = $204
- Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = $160
- Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = $330

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330

Now, let's add these amounts:

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694."
"To start earning money, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree and then start making a profit from selling the lemons.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons. If he sells each lemon for $1.5, then the revenue from selling lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

So, the net profit each year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

We set up the equation:
\[ \$7.5 \times \text{years} = \$90 \]

Solving for years:
\[ \text{years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let's assume Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
6. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
7. Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
8. Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
9. Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\( 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students.

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students remaining.

Next, we find out how many of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is:

\( 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students.

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students for hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\( \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \).

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase that will give him the highest value at the end of the month. Let's calculate the value of each item after the market increase.

For the jewelry:
- Initial value = $5,000
- Market increase = 2.5%
- Value after increase = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value = $8,000
- Market increase = 1.2%
- Value after increase = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, let's find the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Value after increase - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Value after increase - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would make more profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, which would give him a profit of $96."
"To solve this, we need to add the distances covered by each train in both directions.

First, the trains travel westward for 80 miles each.
Then, they travel northwards for 150 miles each.

So, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is 230 miles."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earns from teaching in a year:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Then, her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from being a cheerleading coach in a year:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Then, her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, to find her total annual salary, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is \$57,500."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.
3. If she makes 3 eggs every day, then in 28 days she will use \(28 \times 3 = 84\) eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs. This is done by dividing 84 by 12: \(84 \div 12 = 7\).

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking. She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another 1 hour for the next 2 miles. So, she has already spent 2 hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. To find out the total time she should take to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours, so she needs to spend 1 more hour on the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink before any is spilled.

The orange drink is 10 liters and two-thirds of it is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is 15 liters and three-fifths of it is water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any is spilled:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the mixture remains the same, which is \(\frac{47}{3}\) liters. So, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of the mixture is:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To convert this to a numerical value:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"
"First, let's find out Samantha's age when Raymond had his son. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23 and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Raymond had his son.

Years passed = Samantha's current age - Raymond's age when he had his son
Years passed = 31 - 23
Years passed = 8

Since Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, when Samantha was 25 (which is 6 years before her current age), Raymond was 31. So, when Raymond had his son at 23, Samantha was 25.

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond had his son when Samantha was 25, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago.

So, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"Billy sold 3 DVDs to the first 3 customers because each bought one DVD. He sold 2 DVDs to each of the next 2 customers, so that's 2 DVDs/customer * 2 customers = 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs. 

Adding these up: 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, in 4 hours it will melt by:
2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. Let's denote the original price by \( P \). According to the problem, Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 / $8.50 per box = 2 boxes.

So, the final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of clothing:

- Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50
- Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50
- Shoes: 3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the clothing items:

Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00
Total cost = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings, so she will need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.

Each carton costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, so he traveled 40 - 15 = 35 miles between his first and second stops."
"First, let's find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the other pair costs $33 * 2 = $66. So, the two pairs together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

We are told that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the two pairs of high heels cost $99, then the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

Therefore, the boots are $104."
"To solve this, we first need to find out Darrell's and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio and total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means if we let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, their total age is 7x + 11x = 18x.

We know their total age is 162, so:
\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now we can find their ages:
- Darrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
- Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses:
80 (first friend) + 60 (second friend) + 100 (third friend) = 240

To find the average guess, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 / 3 = 80

So, their average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
So, for 10 dogs, it would be 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours a day.
In a week, there are 7 days.
Therefore, John spends 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.
The final numerical answer is 35."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (S), we can find the number of gold coins (G) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the question, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

jewels.

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

To find the total points, we add the points from both periods together:

\( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

So, the total points Mike scored are 9."
"First, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends $1.25 * 2 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, he will spend $2.50 * 30 = $75.00 on yogurt."
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each, so the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is 13 * $15 = $195. He spends $20 each on 8 video games, so the total cost for the video games is 8 * $20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So, the total amount of money he had initially is the sum of the money from selling the lego sets, the cost of the video games, and the money left, which is $195 + $160 + $5 = $360. Since he spent all the money from selling the lego sets on the video games and has no other expenses mentioned, he doesn't have any lego sets left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is 0."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in those 3 hours and then find his speed.

First, let's find out how long he runs each day:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total running time in a week:
- Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
- Total running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's find out how fast Dana can walk. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she skips at 3 miles per hour, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends six hours in total, then:

\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance she can travel in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28 \]"
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, then Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet away. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

So, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so she had a total of 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

40 - 14 = 26

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"First, let's find out how many calories are left for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total calories in the 300g bag are:

5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

To find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we can calculate the grams you can eat:

0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g.

So, the final numerical answer is 240 grams."
"First, let's determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Next, we subtract the cost of the beeswax and wicks from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Cost of beeswax and wicks
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $30.00."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

1. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 104."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to add the post-it notes she used to the post-it notes she had left. 

So, the calculation is:
\[ 220 \text{ (used)} + 23 \text{ (remaining)} = 243 \text{ (total in the package)} \]

The final numerical answer is 243."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, then he bought:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find out the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, and blue ties cost $40 each, each red tie costs:

\[ \text{Cost of red tie} = \$40 + (0.5 \times \$40) = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet of wire is equal to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\(48 \div 6 = 8\)

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens per day

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. So, to find out how much he makes per day, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

21 dozens/day * $2/dozen = $42/day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"First, we need to calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM), we can calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- For each truck tire, the mechanic charges $60. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 4 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Now, we compare the revenues from Thursday and Friday:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final numerical answer is $40."
"First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. The problem states that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we calculate:

\[ \text{Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of Patchy's kittens:

\[ \text{Total from Patchy} = 21 + 7 = 28 \]

Trixie had 12 kittens. Now, we add the number of Trixie's kittens to the total from Patchy:

\[ \text{Total kittens} = 28 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit. Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so the total cost for one visit is:

\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many times he can spend $14 out of his total $42. We do this by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42."
"First, we need to determine the maximum weight that can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. We subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from this limit to find out how much weight the boxes can add.

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \]

This means the boxes can add a maximum of 1245 pounds to the truck. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding 1245 pounds.

We divide the maximum additional weight by the weight of each box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, we can load 83 boxes onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck is:

\[ 83 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 83 \]"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the delivery fee and the tip to the original bill amount.

The original bill was $40.00.

The delivery fee was $3.00.

The tip was $4.00.

First, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the original bill:
\[ 40.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 47.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees is $47.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters with 20 fruits each, so we multiply 6 by 20:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2
- Good oranges: rest of the oranges

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges:

20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5

Now, let's find out how many oranges are good:

Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's add up the cost of the material and the jeweler's work:
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler) = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of $1300:
10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of the brooch:
$1300 (total cost of material and jeweler) + $130 (insurance) = $1430

So, Janet paid $1430 in total."
"First, let's calculate the pension Marcy gets for the first 20 years. Since she gets $50,000 per year for the first 20 years, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Pension for first 20 years} = 20 \times \$50,000 = \$1,000,000 \]

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000. So, the annual pension for the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30) will be:

\[ \text{Annual pension for next 10 years} = 10 \times (\$1,000,000 \times 0.05) = 10 \times \$50,000 = \$500,000 \]

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the next 10 years to find out her total annual pension after 30 years:

\[ \text{Total annual pension after 30 years} = \$1,000,000 + \$500,000 = \$1,500,000 \]

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be \$1,500,000."
"To solve this, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost for the second half of the year. Since the company charges 10% less on the other half, the cost becomes \(140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126\) dollars per month.

2. Calculate the total cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, the cost for the first half is \(140 \times 6 = 840\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for the second half of the year. Since there are also 6 months in the second half, the cost for the second half is \(126 \times 6 = 756\) dollars.

4. Add the costs of both halves to get the total cost for the year. So, the total cost is \(840 + 756 = 1596\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after driving 100 miles. Since she put in 4 gallons to fill the tank again, this means that the 100 miles she drove used up 4 gallons of gas.

The tank holds 12 gallons in total. If she has used 4 gallons, then she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank.

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gas. We know that 4 gallons of gas can take her 100 miles. Therefore, with 8 gallons, she can drive:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

So, with 8 gallons, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 200 miles."
"First, let's calculate how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

He spends 2 hours watching TV.
He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

In one session, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, in one week he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Now, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 36 hours."
"Each school has sent:
- 5 players for the girls' team
- 5 players for the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school has sent a total of 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"If there are twice as many boys as girls and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is 60 * 2 = 120 boys.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students.

If there are 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is the total number of students divided by 5, which is 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.

So, the final numerical answer is 36."
"Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is $5 * 8 = $40. If at the end of 8 weeks she has a total of $100, then the amount she started with is $100 - $40 = $60.

The final numerical answer is $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week:

- Judy teaches 5 classes every day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays.
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

So, in a week, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- So, for 33 classes, she teaches 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Finally, let's calculate the total money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, for 495 students, she makes 495 * 15 = $7,425.00.

The final numerical answer is $7,425.00."
"The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions. To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions."
"To calculate how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For the brownies:
43 brownies * $3 per brownie = $129

For the cheesecakes:
23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = $92

Now, we add the totals:
$129 + $92 = $221

So, Tommy raises $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest. Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each.

Total cost of cell phones = 5 * $150 = $750

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit.

Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

Total interest = 5 * $3 = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones to get the total amount Shiela will pay.

Total amount to pay = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

Monthly payment = Total amount to pay / 3 = $765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"To solve this, we need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total sales.

1. Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
2. Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
3. Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

1. Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
2. Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
3. Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

Adding these together gives the total sales:

$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, Artie will make $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: Half of Level 4, so 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
- Level 2: Half of Level 3, so 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
- Level 1: Half of Level 2, so 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life in the first year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

After the first 180 days, the puppy will live for the rest of its life. However, we are only asked to calculate for the first year, which is not specified in terms of the puppy's lifespan. Assuming the first year is the same as the first 180 days for this calculation, the puppy will not have any additional days of food consumption in the first year.

Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the first year is:
\[ 180 \, \text{cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food this is. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia can't use a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number because she can't buy a fraction of a bag. So, she will need 2 bags of dog food.

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much Raymond does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To solve this, let's first figure out the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50:
Cost per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating)

For the package of 2 flowers for $1:
Cost per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50

The cheaper option is to buy flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each.

Now, let's calculate how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers:
Number of packages = 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

The total cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper price is:
Total cost = 9 packages * $1 per package = $9

Since the question asks how much money he saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, and we don't have the cost of buying 18 flowers at the $2.50 per 3 flowers price, we can only calculate the savings based on the given information.

The savings would be the difference between the cost at the more expensive option and the cost at the cheaper option:
Savings = Cost at more expensive option - Cost at cheaper option

Cost at more expensive option (if we assume he buys 6 packages of 3 flowers):
Cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

Savings = $15 - $9 = $6

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost is $100, and the discount is 30% of $100.

30% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \frac{30}{100} \times 100 = 30 \]

So, the discount amount is $30.

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original cost:
\[ \text{Cost After Discount} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the cost after the discount is $70."
"First, we need to find out how much water the two girls got together. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate the total amount of water the girls got by multiplying 24 liters by 1/6:

\[ 24 \times \frac{1}{6} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, the two girls together got 4 liters of water. Now, we add the 6 liters of water that the boy got:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Originally, there were 24 liters of water. After the girls and the boy got their share, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers.
He bought 21 stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.
The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, Alex's weight is calculated as follows:
\[ 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes = 3
Number of roses per bush = 25
Number of thorns per rose = 8

Total thorns = Number of rose bushes × Number of roses per bush × Number of thorns per rose
Total thorns = 3 × 25 × 8

First, multiply 3 and 25:
3 × 25 = 75

Next, multiply the result by 8:
75 × 8 = 600

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is given as 22. So we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he started vacationing when he was 23, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent vacation, he adds another quilt block. Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of quilt blocks from each year increases by four each year.

So, the number of quilt blocks from each year of vacations can be calculated as follows:
- Year 1: 1 block
- Year 2: 1 + 4 = 5 blocks
- Year 3: 5 + 4 = 9 blocks
- Year 4: 9 + 4 = 13 blocks
- Year 5: 13 + 4 = 17 blocks
- Year 6: 17 + 4 = 21 blocks
- Year 7: 21 + 4 = 25 blocks
- Year 8: 25 + 4 = 29 blocks
- Year 9: 29 + 4 = 33 blocks
- Year 10: 33 + 4 = 37 blocks
- Year 11: 37 + 4 = 41 blocks

Now, we add all these blocks together to get the total number of quilt blocks:
1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 + 29 + 33 + 37 + 41

Let's add these numbers step by step:
1 + 5 = 6
6 + 9 = 15
15 + 13 = 28
28 + 17 = 45
45 + 21 = 66
66 + 25 = 91
91 + 29 = 120
120 + 33 = 153
153 + 37 = 190
190 + 41 = 231

So, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 231."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's calculate Sylvie's salary after the first year of the 10% increase. Her initial salary is $600.

The increase is 10% of $600, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

So, her salary after the first year will be:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Next, we calculate her salary after the second year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the first year is $660.

The increase is 10% of $660, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 660 = 66 \]

So, her salary after the second year will be:
\[ 660 + 66 = 726 \]

Now, we calculate her salary after the third year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the second year is $726.

The increase is 10% of $726, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 726 = 72.6 \]

So, her salary after the third year will be:
\[ 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to find out how many guests will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, 3/4 of the invited friends will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests attending is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per attending guest. So, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs and there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]
And with 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for adults and children:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"If Cindy has four pets, Marcia, who has two more pets than Cindy, has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. The total number of pets the three have is 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"First, we need to find out how long it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the information, Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, so if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is 36 seconds."
"If there are 60 dogs, and there are two cats for every dog, then there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 dogs + 120 cats = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the dogs, cats, and rabbits, which is 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits = 348 pets.

So, the final numerical answer is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

Total students = 200
Fraction of boys = 2/5
Fraction of girls = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5

Number of boys = Total students * Fraction of boys
Number of boys = 200 * 2/5 = 80

Number of girls = Total students * Fraction of girls
Number of girls = 200 * 3/5 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = Number of girls * 2/3
Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * 2/3 = 80

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we first need to calculate how many hours that is. 

To find out how many hours James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep hours by 2/3:

\( 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \) hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\( 9 - 6 = 3 \) hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"First, we need to determine how many ounces of tomatoes Freda started with. Since her sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original tomatoes must have been twice that amount. So, the original tomatoes were:

\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can:

\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- The cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes plus the 5 cars that took an exit should equal the 25 cars left on the motorway.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ x + 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 25 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 25 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

So, 0 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which means she will give away 40 potted plants. After giving away the plants, she will remain with 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages in one day."
"John drinks water with his meals every weekday, which is 5 days a week. So, he drinks 5 glasses of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On weekends, he drinks 1 glass of water with dinner. So, for the weekend, he drinks 1 glass of water.

"To solve this, we first need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city.

42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:

14 segments * 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. Since the puzzle has 1000 pieces, a quarter of 1000 is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

2. After Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[
   \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

4. After Poppy's mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's add up the hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on other days.

From Monday to Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each day, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add these up: 2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5.5 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, we divide the hours he watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He ended up baking 15 more than he meant to, so \( 2x = x + 15 \).
4. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 15 \). So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies.
5. But he actually baked \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies.
6. He then dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cookies left.
7. Now, he has a total of 110 cookies, which means he must have added \( 110 - 25 = 85 \) cookies to the 25 he had left.

The question asks for the number of cookies Henry baked last year, which is \( x = 15 \).

"First, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The price is $3.00 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it would be:
\[ 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it would be:
\[ 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas to find the final amount after the cashback:
\[ 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \]

So, the final amount after the cashback rewards is:
\[ 28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate how many roll-ups each of them ate.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
Width = 3 roll-ups
Length = 14 roll-ups
Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
Width = 2 roll-ups
Length = 24 roll-ups
Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate:
Total roll-ups eaten = Marcell's roll-ups + Beatrice's roll-ups = 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):
Average roll-ups eaten = Total roll-ups eaten / Number of people = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it would take her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, let's find out how many 10-foot segments are in the 64 seconds it took her to row to the shore. We divide 64 by 8 to get 8 segments.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows, and she rows 8 segments of 10 feet, the boat would take on 2 liters * 8 = 16 liters of water.

So, the final numerical answer is 16 liters."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson. So, for one teacher, the whiteboard is cleaned 2 times (lessons) * 3 times (cleanings per lesson) = 6 times a day.

"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Jamal's phone capacity} = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times B \]

Since we already know Brittany's phone capacity is 300:

\[ 300 = 50 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 50:

\[ B = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since the question asks for the number of ducks, and assuming each bird in the photograph is a duck, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since Sasha is selling all the leftover lumber, we need to know the selling price per board to calculate the profit. However, the question doesn't specify the selling price. Assuming we need to calculate the profit based on the total cost and the selling price is not provided, we can only state the total cost.

The total cost of the leftover lumber is $180. Without the selling price, we cannot determine the profit. So, the final numerical answer based on the given information is:

$180"
"To solve this, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Together, these parts make up 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined).

To find out how many parts of the total are sugar, we use the ratio of sugar parts to the total parts. The ratio of sugar parts is 7 out of 20.

So, the number of parts of sugar used is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of sugar parts} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of sugar parts} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so he pays 6 * $60 = $360. 

The final numerical answer is $360."
"To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port before the second day.

On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day was:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can find Lylah's salary four years ago by rearranging the equation:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{\text{Adrien's salary}}{1.30} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

Now, let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to find out Adrien's salary four years later. We know that his salary had increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later would also be 40% higher than what she was making four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43076.92 \]

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we first need to calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Morisette brought 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 2 * 5 apples = 10 apples and 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges.

Together, they brought 13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits.
The final answer is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
For Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
For Wednesday, she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
For the next two days, she slept a total of 6 + 4 = 10 hours.
For the rest of the week, she slept 4 + 2 = 6 hours more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 6 = 12 hours.
In total, throughout the week, she slept 8 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 30 hours.
The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate how much time she has left after running for 3 hours.

Total time available = 7 hours
Time already spent = 3 hours
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Now, we calculate how far she can run at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 mph * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distance she ran at 10 mph to the distance she ran at 5 mph.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 50 miles."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which means she stamps 60 letters / 3 = 20 letters.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she had already stamped 20 letters, that means there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia originally had some spoons, but they were plastic and she was out of them.
2. She bought a new package of spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons left.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had after receiving the package from her husband and before using any was \( x + 5 \).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. This means:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought was 10."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find the total number of sausages he bought, we add the chicken sausages and fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages. 

The final numerical answer is 82."
"If Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, then Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends."
"First, let's find out the cost of each type of fruit based on the information given:

- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

\(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60.

Total minutes seen per day = 500 people * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes
Total hours seen per day = 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the doctors and the patients.

Revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000
Revenue from patients = 500 people * $200/person = $100000

Total revenue = Revenue from doctors + Revenue from patients
Total revenue = $30000 + $100000 = $130000

Now, we need to know the total cost. Since the problem doesn't specify any costs other than the revenue, we assume the cost is zero for this calculation.

Profit = Total revenue - Cost
Profit = $130000 - $0 = $130000

The hospital makes a profit of $130000 from these visits."
"First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract these 10 elves from the 40 remaining:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[ 30 \]"
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

"First, let's calculate the tickets Pam used:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- In total, Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.

Now, let's calculate the tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- In total, Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:
- Pam used 24 tickets.
- Fred used 36 tickets.
- Together, they used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets in a month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15.

So, the cost for one month is:
4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60

Now, to find out the cost for a year:
$60 per month * 12 months = $720

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from that number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Calculate how many of those are female.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in total and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

Now, we add the 20% delivery fee:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could have answered in the time he had for each test.

For the first test:
- He had 8 hours.
- He answered 5 questions per hour.
So, the number of questions he could answer in 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).
Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\).

For the second test:
- He had 6 hours.
- He answered 5 questions per hour.
So, the number of questions he could answer in 6 hours is \(6 \times 5 = 30\).
Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\).

Now, to find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[35 + 70 = 105\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many blue gumballs there are. According to the question, there are 12 blue gumballs.

Now, we need to find out how many pink gumballs there are. The question states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P.

Given:
B = 12

The relationship between pink and blue gumballs is:
P = 4 * B + 22

Now, let's substitute the value of B into the equation:
P = 4 * 12 + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final numerical answer is 70."

20 - 12 - 4 = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20%."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of queens is Q.
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q.
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Now, we know the total number of bees is 700. So we can write the equation:

Q (queens) + 2Q (baby bees) + 4Q (worker bees) = 700

Combining like terms gives us:

7Q = 700

To find Q, we divide both sides by 7:

Q = 700 / 7 = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of worker bees:

Number of worker bees = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400."

- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Adding these up: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Now, let's calculate the tax on these nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is 10% of 15 dollars:

Tax amount = 15 * 0.10 = 1.5 dollars

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Total cost = 15 + 1.5 = 16.5 dollars

So, the total cost including tax is 16.5 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so that's 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16 bottles. The total number of packs of cloths needed is also 8 * 1 = 8 packs.

The cost of the bleach is $2 per bottle, so for 16 bottles, the total cost is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of the cloths is $5 per pack, so for 8 packs, the total cost is 8 * $5 = $40.

So, the total expenses for 8 clients are $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field.
2. There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
3. John can harvest every 3 months.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples John gets from his field in one harvest:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many harvests John can get in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ 12 \text{ months} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\(500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\)

So, Johnny picks up 2125 lego pieces."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. Half that many bees return in the next 6 hours, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. Twice as many bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours, which is 30 * 2 = 60 bees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive:

30 bees left in the first 6 hours + 60 bees left in the next 6 hours = 90 bees.

Next, we need to account for the bees that returned. We know that 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours. So, the number of bees that left but haven't returned yet is:

90 bees that left - 15 bees that returned = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before the last 6 hours returns to the hive. Since 75 bees left before the last 6 hours, all 75 of them return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75."
"To solve this, we need to add the cost of an adult ticket and a child ticket together and then add the change Brittany's mom received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22.

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier was the total cost plus the change.

Therefore, the amount she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance Steve lives from the school into feet because his speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Steve's speed = 440 feet per minute

Time for Steve to reach home = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Now, let's convert Tim's distance into feet.

Tim's distance in feet = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Tim's speed = 264 feet per minute

Time for Tim to reach home = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house for the loser (Steve) for:

Time difference = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this, let's break it down:

1. For the bicycles, each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since each bicycle has 2 tires, that means 25 cents * 2 = 50 cents per bicycle.
2. On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles, so the total cost for the bicycles is 50 cents * 5 = 250 cents.
3. For the tricycles, each tire also costs 25 cents to inflate. Since each tricycle has 3 tires, that means 25 cents * 3 = 75 cents per tricycle.
4. 3 people came with tricycles, so the total cost for the tricycles is 75 cents * 3 = 225 cents.
5. For the unicycle, since it has 1 tire, the cost is 25 cents.
6. The total cost for the unicycle is 25 cents.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 400 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert 400 cents to dollars:
400 cents / 100 = 4 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 4 dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

- Each pack has six cookies.
So, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's find out the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
So, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
So, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's work backwards to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. So, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. Therefore, the original pack of fries had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, each of these days he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. So, each of these days he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we add the hours spent on both types of days to get the total hours spent in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

For the chocolate croissants:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

For the baguettes:
60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 feet = 24 inches)

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To convert the total length to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Now, to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months, we multiply the monthly total by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, for each round trip, he runs 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards per round trip. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards/trip} \times 15 \text{ trips} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \text{ yards/trip} \times 34 \text{ trips} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item he bought and then add them together.

The cost of the pens is:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

The cost of the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

The cost of the rim of bond paper is:
$20

Now, we add all these costs together:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more came out of hiding, so that's an increase of 6 tadpoles. But then 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, which is a decrease of 2 tadpoles. So, the calculation is:

11 (initial tadpoles) + 6 (tadpoles that came out) - 2 (tadpoles that hid) = 15 tadpoles.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, which is 24 * (2/3) = 16 feet.
The final water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Now, let's determine how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now we can calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin together.

Anakin's total fish: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.
Locsin's total fish: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.

Adding these together, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's calculate the price increase every two months. The original price is $20. A 20% increase on $20 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. This means the price after two months would be:

\[ \text{Price after 2 months} = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate the price after 36 months. There are 18 intervals of two months in 36 months. Each interval adds $4 to the price. So, the total increase over 36 months is:

\[ \text{Total increase} = 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Adding this total increase to the original price gives us the price after 36 months:

\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.

So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find out the total cost of all the toys.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the red cars, the action figures, and the doll.

There are 5 red cars, so the total cost for the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

There are 3 action figures, so the total cost for the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Adding all the costs together, we get $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

So, the final numerical answer is $50."
"First, we need to calculate how much money Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. So, the total loss would be:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jackie would earn if she hires an accountant. The accountant charges $90, so she would lose $90 by hiring the accountant.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Jackie would have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself. We do this by subtracting the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss she would incur by doing her taxes herself:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ -\$15 \]"
"First, let's add up the cost of all the accessories Elvira bought:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, the final numerical answer is:
€77"
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.
Since she gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, she needs to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times.

The final answer is 5."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"Twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.
Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.
The final numerical answer is $18."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Now, we add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday to the miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday:
- Total miles in a week = 100 miles (Monday to Friday) + 20 miles (Saturday and Sunday) = 120 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25, the jacket costs:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pants cost. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average of $25 and $75 is:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates, and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the invertebrates is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we add the legs from the spiders, insects, and invertebrates together:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of the four birds:

Sally Two: 19 years
Granny Red: 16 years
Sally Four: 8 years
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

The final numerical answer is 51."
"First, let's calculate the minimum payments for each of Jessica's debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Now, let's calculate the total minimum payment per month:

Total minimum payment = Student loans + Credit card + Mortgage
Total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500
Total minimum payment = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out how much that is, we calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, the total payment per month will be:

Total payment per month = Total minimum payment + 50% of total minimum payment
Total payment per month = $1000 + $500
Total payment per month = $1500

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):

Total payment per year = Total payment per month * 12
Total payment per year = $1500 * 12
Total payment per year = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel all the potatoes. If it takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, then for 60 potatoes, it would be:

\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. If it takes him 5 seconds to cut one potato, then for 60 potatoes, it would be:

\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

They made a profit of $25, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $25. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). The total revenue is then:
\[ \$10 \times x \]

The total cost for lemons and sugar is:
\[ \$3 \times x + \$2 \times x = \$5 \times x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost for lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the charity donation.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

Rent: 1/4 of his salary = 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
Car fuel: 1/3 of his salary = 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$

Donation to charity: Half of the remaining amount = 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

Now, let's subtract the money given to his daughter and wife.

Money given to daughter: 200$
Money given to wife: 700$
Total given to daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900$

Remaining amount after giving money to daughter and wife: 1250 - 900 = 350$

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is 350$."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Next, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"If the winner got 3/4 of the votes, then the loser must have gotten the remaining 1/4 of the votes. 

The total number of votes cast was 80. So, the number of votes the loser got is 1/4 of 80.

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this, let's first define the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
- The number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. So, \( 5W = 200 \).
- Solving for \( W \), we get \( W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \).

Now, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).

Substituting the value of \( W \):
- The number of red roses is \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is 160."
"If Jan is 30 years old, then two years ago Jan was 28 years old.

Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, so Mark was 5 + (28/2) = 5 + 14 = 19 years old two years ago.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean was 19 + 2 = 21 years old two years ago.

So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, and there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). So, the total time for the slower team is:

\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:

\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in their probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To convert this difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.
Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 3 cages of rats, and we need to find out how many rats are in each cage.
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per cage} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total straw to find out how much straw was given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the straw is distributed equally among the rats in 3 cages, we divide the total pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 30 \text{ pieces per cage} \]

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find out how many rats are in each cage by dividing the pieces of straw per cage by the pieces of straw per rat:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ pieces per cage}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the interest for each month and then add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, so for one month, the interest on $100 is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since this is for 3 months, the total interest would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months is the principal plus the total interest:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \]

The final numerical answer is:
106"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the trader. The trader buys the wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22. Let's denote the number of bags as \( n \). The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \).

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \).

The trader made a total profit of $400. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags. The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects peaches for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. If he can collect 2 peaches a minute, then in 180 minutes he collects 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed for the week and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

The total amount of insects needed for the week is 3.5 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week.

So, to find the daily amount, we divide 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, he would have 50 + 80 = 130 trees. After 10 years, 30% of these trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. Therefore, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees."
"First, let's calculate how many flamingos were taken back on Saturday. The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos, which is:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white. This means the number of pink flamingos left in the yard after Saturday is:

\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, the total number of pink flamingos in the yard by Sunday morning is:

\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

On Sunday, they also added 18 white flamingos, so the total number of white flamingos is:

\[ 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons is 5 * $2 = $10. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. Therefore, the change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10."
"First, we need to find out how much a pen costs. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

So, the cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"First, let's calculate the number of cards Elaine collected each month.

1. In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards. Since she initially had 20 cards, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards in the first month.

2. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards in the second month.

3. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards in the third month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now. She started with 20 cards, and then added the cards she collected over the three months.

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards collected in the first month + Cards collected in the second month + Cards collected in the third month
Total cards = \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\)

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences at 5 cents each, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
For 500 sentences at 10 cents each, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, to find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total liters of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters. 

The final numerical answer is 55."
"First, let's calculate the raise in John's salary. His current salary is $2000 a week, and the raise is 5%. 

To find the raise amount:
\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, let's calculate how much he makes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his yearly salary:
\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, let's break down the information given:

1. Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
2. For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days in the week, using 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
3. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's calculate the total slices of cheese used:

- For sandwiches: 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices
- For omelets: 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices
- For macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Adding these together: 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens we bought, we get:
\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:
\[ 98 \]"
"To solve this, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. First, we calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

2. Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). After removing the lowest score, which is 71, the average of the remaining five scores will be 93. So, the sum of the remaining four scores (after removing the lowest) should be \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

3. The sum of the remaining four scores is \( 440 - 71 = 369 \). We need this sum to be 465, so:
   \( 369 + x = 465 \)

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \( x = 465 - 369 = 96 \)

So, Brinley needs a score of 96 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week and each time he rode 25 kilometers.

Distance in the first four weeks = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride * 4 weeks

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode in the next three weeks. He rode 2 times a week and each time he rode 60 kilometers.

Distance in the next three weeks = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride * 3 weeks

Now, let's add these two distances to get the total distance.

Let's calculate it step by step.
```python
# Calculating the distance for the first four weeks
rides_first_period = 5
km_per_ride_first_period = 25
weeks_first_period = 4
distance_first_period = rides_first_period * km_per_ride_first_period * weeks_first_period

# Calculating the distance for the next three weeks
rides_second_period = 2
km_per_ride_second_period = 60
weeks_second_period = 3
distance_second_period = rides_second_period * km_per_ride_second_period * weeks_second_period

# Total distance
total_distance = distance_first_period + distance_second_period

It seems there's still an issue with the variable names. Let's directly calculate the distances and sum them up without using variable names for clarity.

Here's the calculation again:

1. Distance for the first four weeks: \(5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks}\)
2. Distance for the next three weeks: \(2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks}\)

Let's calculate these values.
```python
# Calculating the distance for the first four weeks
distance_first_period = 5 * 25 * 4

# Calculating the distance for the next three weeks
distance_second_period = 2 * 60 * 3

# Total distance
total_distance = distance_first_period + distance_second_period
total_distance

It seems there's a persistent issue with the variable names. Let's directly compute the distances and sum them up without using variable names for clarity.

Here's the calculation:

1. Distance for the first four weeks: \(5 \times 25 \times 4\)
2. Distance for the next three weeks: \(2 \times 60 \times 3\)

It seems there's a persistent issue with the variable names. Let's directly compute the distances and sum them up without using variable names for clarity.

Here's the calculation:

1. Distance for the first four weeks: \(5 \times 25 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers
2. Distance for the next three weeks: \(2 \times 60 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers

Now, let's sum these distances to get the total distance.

Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 bars * 40g/bar = 1000g.
The total weight of the candied apples is 80 apples * 20g/apple = 1600g.

Adding these together gives us the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes from each day together:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

So, the final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Use the information given to find the cost of each cup.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
Each plate costs $6000.
So, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
Twenty dozen cups mean 240 cups.
Let's denote the cost of each cup as \( x \).
So, the total cost for 240 cups is:
\[ 240 \times x \]

Step 3: Use the information given to find the cost of each cup.
According to the problem, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
So, we can write the equation:
\[ 240x = 36000 - 1200 \]
\[ 240x = 34800 \]
Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{34800}{240} \]
\[ x = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 240 \times 145 = 34800 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the shoes cost $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she needs to earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn is $70 - $10 = $60.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \( x \). Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x. We need this to equal $60:
\[ 4x = 60 \]
\[ x = \frac{60}{4} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
15"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, it's given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as:

\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens, which is:

\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Now, we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, since that's the distance he walks. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, she counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- By the end of the third day, the total number of customers counted was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted by the end of the third day.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = \text{Total customers by the third day} - (\text{Customers on the first day} + \text{Customers on the second day}) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - (100 + 150) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 2S \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S' \]
where \( S' \) is the amount of water in the small pool now.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from each pool in the last 4 minutes is:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the current amount of water in the big pool is:
\[ B - 16 \]

And the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S - 16 \]

Given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

We already know from the first condition that \( B = 2S \). Substituting \( B = 2S \) into the equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 64 - 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 48 = 2S \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, the small pool has:
\[ S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt. 

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase.
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, which means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
45

"First, let's find out how many points Yuri scored. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Next, let's find out how many points Brianna scored. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.

The tank originally had 120 liters.
Celine used 90 liters, so the remaining water is:
120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Now, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives us the total amount of water in the tank now:
30 + 60 = 90 liters.

So, the final numerical answer is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. To find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers."
"First, we need to find out how much the company spent on advertising for the second year. They spent a third of $15000 on the second year, so:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spent $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Now, to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, let's calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. He rents it for 3 hours at $30 per hour:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
So, Carlos pays $90 for renting the canoe.

Next, let's calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. He rents it for 5 hours at $18 per hour:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
So, Benji pays $90 for renting the banana boat raft.

Now, we add the amounts they both paid to find the total cost:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:
\[ 180 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus and half as many days to travel by car, we calculate:

\[ \text{Days by car} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip:

\[ \text{Total days} = 6 \text{ days (to Rochester by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (return by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

He starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. So, the number of water type cards left is:
40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82 cards

Now, to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{82} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{82} \right) \times 100 \approx 39.21875 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 39\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
39"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and upgrades:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together in one minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons left after she took some home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we add the registration cost for each car. The registration cost is $1000 per car.

\[ \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Final amount} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and half as many bugs as ants, then there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs. The total number of insects in the garden would be the number of ants plus the number of bugs, which is 50 + 25 = 75."
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump in, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Since another one-third of the 36 penguins go inside the cave, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, to find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that went to the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:

\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's intake} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly intake} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly intake} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the total number of tomatoes they eat together in a week is:

\[ \text{Total weekly intake} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:

\[ \text{Number of vines} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To solve this, we need to figure out the total number of pizza slices John needs and then determine how many whole pizzas he should order.

First, calculate the total number of slices needed:
- John has 20 friends and he wants each to have 4 slices.
- So, the total number of slices needed is \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required to get at least 80 slices. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:
- \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to have enough slices for everyone."
"Ram starts with 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens he can make 1 new pen. So, with 25 pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens. After making these 5 new pens, he will have used up 20 of his original 25 pens (since he used 5 to make the new ones). Now he has 5 new pens plus the 5 remaining original pens, which totals to:

\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 10."
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. When he invested this sum and it tripled, he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year."
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Mary is. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages together: Jessa's age (20) + Joan's age (25) + Mary's age (23) = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

So, the final numerical answer is 68."
"First, let's calculate how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining students are:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

After students went through exit B, the remaining students are:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Students through C} = 280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has to find out how many candies James has.

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 3 books (her 2 plus Pandora's 1) and Pandora will read 3 books (her 1 plus Dolly's 2). So, together they will have read 6 books. 

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping with 2, he has:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:
\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the time he spends writing a week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used this month and subtract that from his total plan.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason has used for his calls with his boss. Since he has 30 days and each day he makes a 15-minute call, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
\[ 30 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ minutes/day} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for other people:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his phone plan of 1000 minutes:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:

Number of snails in the first aquarium: 4
Number of snails in the second aquarium: 32

Difference in snails = Number of snails in the second aquarium - Number of snails in the first aquarium
Difference in snails = 32 - 4 = 28

According to the question, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

So, we have:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, we solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time, so:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ hours per week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \times 250 = 30000 \]

She gives Jean a 10% discount, so the discount amount is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \]

So, Jean paid:
\[ 27000 \]"
"First, we need to find the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Isabelle is splitting this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost is being divided among three people. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

So, each person paid $32."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, so:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 200 pounds of onions cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories, so let's calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the number of boys and girls in the school is:
50% of 60 students = 0.50 * 60 = 30 boys
30 students - 30 boys = 30 girls

In the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
20 students/class - 15 girls = 5 boys

In the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
20 students/class - 12 girls = 8 boys

Now, let's find out how many boys are in the third class. We know the total number of boys in the school and the number of boys in the first and second classes:
30 boys (total) - 5 boys (first class) - 8 boys (second class) = 17 boys

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17."

The final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let's say today Rick killed \(x\) cougars.
   - According to the problem, today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed \(3x\) wolves.
   - Also, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars.

3. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Since today he killed 12 cougars, we have \(x = 12\).
   - Therefore, he killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves today.

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27

5. **Final Total:**
   - Total animals killed = Wolves + Cougars = 46 + 27 = 73

So, the final numerical answer is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find out the floor he ends up on, we multiply his starting floor by 4 and then add 6. So, we calculate:

Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Mitchel went down the slide 30 times and Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate Anne's total as follows:

30% of 30 is 0.30 * 30 = 9.

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final numerical answer is 84."
"First, let's find out how many cows are in each of the original stalls. Since there are 20 cows in each of the 10 stalls, we can calculate the total number of cows as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows/stall} \times 10 \text{ stalls} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, we need to find out how many cows go into each stall with the new cows:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows and now has an additional 2 cows, so each stall has:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows} \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall now has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"To solve this, let's convert each type of coin and bill to dollars.

- Pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01 = $1.00
- Nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05 = $2.00
- Dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10 = $2.00
- Dollar bills: 40 pieces * $1.00 = $40.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to find out the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total length by the length of each section to find out how many sections there are:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, we need to find out what 70% of the tree's weight is (since 100% - 30% = 70%). We calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final weight of the redwood tree is:
\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue, which is $2.00. So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 6.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Given Andrea's apples are 52:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to find Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Now, we know Jamal has 44 apples. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 \]

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} \]

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's add up all the fruits Andrea and Jamal have:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 168."

She is making 36 cookies today, which is 3 dozen cookies.
So, for 3 dozen cookies, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.
Tomorrow, she is making 30 cookies, which is 2.5 dozen cookies.
So, for 2.5 dozen cookies, she will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.
Therefore, to make 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.
The final numerical answer is 11."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. The cup has 9,300 pennies, so we calculate two thirds of 9,300:

\[
\text{Pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack. Since each penny is worth $0.01, we convert the number of pennies to dollars:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

The final numerical answer is:

62"
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.
After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 270."
"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has and then add 5:

\[ \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Samantha has. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Carmen has $100, we can calculate Samantha's money as follows:

Samantha's money = Carmen's money + $25
Samantha's money = $100 + $25
Samantha's money = $125

Next, we need to find out how much money Daisy has. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:

Daisy's money = Samantha's money + $50
Daisy's money = $125 + $50
Daisy's money = $175

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add up the money each one has:

Total money = Carmen's money + Samantha's money + Daisy's money
Total money = $100 + $125 + $175
Total money = $400

So, the final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

Excess amount = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
Excess amount = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.03 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.05 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, the additional time needed to heat up to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up to 400 degrees is:
20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes

Next, we know it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat up the oil. We have two different heating times, but we need to consider the longest heating time, which is 28 minutes, to find the cooking time.

Cooking time is 5 minutes less than the heating time to 400 degrees:
28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to the time it took to cook the chicken:
28 minutes (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 51 minutes

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 51 minutes."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately and then add them together.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per ad = $5
Number of ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per ad = $75
Number of ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs together:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"First, we need to find out how many golf balls there are. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of them are golf balls, we divide 16 by 2:

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 golf balls.

Next, we need to find out how many of these golf balls are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we divide the number of golf balls by 2:

8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag:

- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up all the M&Ms:

300 (from the first bag) + 312 (from the second bag) + 150 (from the third bag) = 762 M&Ms.

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, so each house has 3 * 2 = 6 windows from bedrooms. Additionally, each house has 4 windows that are not connected to bedrooms. So, each house has a total of 6 + 4 = 10 windows. Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20 windows."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by the mother. We do this by adding the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Cost of cocoa = $4.20
Cost of laundry = $9.45
Cost of pasta = $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's add these amounts:

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives back $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the sweater's body:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Collar and rosette total stitches} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. So, the stitches for the body and the sleeves together are:
\[ \text{Body and sleeves total stitches} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for tomato seeds is:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, the total cost for celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, to find the total amount of money she used to buy the seeds, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

So, the final numerical answer is $3200."
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

For the solo song, Sean has to memorize all 54 lines.

For the first scene, the number of lines is twice the number of lines in the solo song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]
Sean has to memorize a third of these lines, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines} \]

For the second scene, the number of lines is six more than the number of lines in the solo song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]
Sean has to memorize four-fifths of these lines, so:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 138 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole.
2. Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole.
3. He needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, let's calculate the total time for the small holes:
- Time for 30 small holes = 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the large holes:
- Time for 15 large holes = 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will increase by 10 for each of them. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

20 + 10 + 10 = 40

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ 7 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total spots for the cobras are:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total spots for the mambas are:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for the cobras and mambas to get the combined total:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests = 24 guests.

Total number of people = team members + coaches + guests
Total number of people = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve.

Number of pizzas needed = Total number of people / Number of people each pizza serves
Number of pizzas needed = 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza.

Total cost = Number of pizzas needed * Cost per pizza
Total cost = 13 * $15 = $195

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas."
"First, let's calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is one inch long and she uses 8 of them, the total length used by the gemstones is:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length used by the sterling silver beads is:

\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find out how many beads are used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:

\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week, Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories, Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories, and Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:

- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.
The final answer is 90."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

For the rows of 8 stars:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

For the rows of 6 stars:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add these up to find out how many stars are accounted for in the 8 and 6 star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. So, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 3 trucks."
"First, we need to find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we calculate:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance, we use the same time to find out the time it took for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the question, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for 4 hours in total, but she takes a half-hour break. So, she works for 3.5 hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3.5 hours, she works for 3.5 * 60 = 210 minutes.

She earns $5 every 10 minutes, so for 210 minutes, she earns 210 / 10 * $5 = 21 * $5 = $105.

The final numerical answer is 105."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the initial 3 rounds.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so:
\[ \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18 \]

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so:
\[ \text{Tony's points} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Now, let's see if any of them get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to those who have over 20 points.

Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point:
\[ \text{Mike's points after fourth round} = 21 + 1 = 22 \]

Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point:
\[ \text{Jim's points after fourth round} = 18 \]

Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point:
\[ \text{Tony's points after fourth round} = 42 + 1 = 43 \]

Now, let's calculate the total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed:
\[ \text{Total points} = \text{Mike's points} + \text{Jim's points} + \text{Tony's points} \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220 pushups
- Squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90 squats
- Dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60 dumbbell presses

Adding these up gives the total count of activities:
220 pushups + 90 squats + 60 dumbbell presses = 370 total activities

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day for each person, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any bread on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, 12 crates, and on Thursday, 18 crates. Let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:

15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend:

45 crates (Tuesday to Thursday) + 20 crates (weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:

120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To solve this, let's break down the bids:

1. The first person bids $200.
2. The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. Carmen bids $300 + $50 = $350.

So, Carmen wins the desk for $350."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven.

He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver per year.

The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find out how much John pays a year for driving.

Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for driving."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:
16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, you need to fold the paper twice. Here's how it works:

1. First, you fold the paper in half vertically. This gives you 2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back.
2. Then, you unfold the paper and fold it in half again vertically. This gives you 4 pages on the front and 4 pages on the back.

So, you have 8 pages in total. Since each page is printed on both sides, you need 2 pieces of paper to make 8 pages.

Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper."
"Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had $50 - $25 = $25 left. She then spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is $25 - $10 = $15.

The final amount left is $15."
"First, let's determine the number of books sold each year.

Given:
- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold = Total books - Unsold books = 250 - 50 = 200 books
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90 books

Now, we can find out the number of books sold in the second year:
- Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - Books sold in the first year - Books sold this year
- Books sold in the second year = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
- Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book = 65 * 20 = $1300

The final numerical answer is:
1300"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of days Watson works in a month:**
   - April typically has 30 days.
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - So, in April, he works \(5 \times 30 = 150\) days.

2. **Calculate the number of hours Watson works in a month:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day.
   - So, in April, he works \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) hours.

3. **Calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, his earnings from hourly wage in April are \(1500 \times 10 = 15000\) dollars.

4. **Add the weekly bonus to his monthly earnings:**
   - He gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in April, his total bonus for the month is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) dollars.

5. **Calculate his total earnings for the month:**
   - His total earnings are the sum of his hourly wage earnings and his bonus.
   - So, his total earnings for April are \(15000 + 1200 = 16200\) dollars.

Watson made **16200 dollars** in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many people John beat. If he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we calculate 80% of 20.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

So, after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[ \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. So, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon:

\[ \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks. Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. So, the discount per tub of ice cream is:

$13 - $11 = $2

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream would be:

$2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk would be:

$0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, to find the total savings when you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

$4 + $2 = $6

So, the final numerical answer is $6."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many times the person grows an extra arm and how many times they grow an extra leg within the 15 days.

For the extra arm:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times they grow an extra arm is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

For the extra leg:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times they grow an extra leg is \(15 \div 5 = 3\).

So, the total number of new limbs grown in 15 days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
- Extra arms = 5
- Extra legs = 3

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's find out the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
5 * $100 = $500

So, the flight ticket costs:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits = $600
Cost of suitcases = $150
Cost of flight ticket = $1200

Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he has for the trip is:
Total amount for the trip = $6000

The amount he can spend on gifts for his business partners is:
Amount for gifts = Total amount for the trip - Total cost
Amount for gifts = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

So, the final numerical answer is $4050."
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day. That's 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs per day.

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day. That's 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs per day.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of eggs consumed per day by the family. That's 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family will consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days. So, 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week.

The final numerical answer is 91."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:
30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent is:
27 + 5 = 32 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. If Cera was 46 years old six years ago, then Noah was half that age, which is 23 years old.

Six years ago, Noah was 23 years old, so currently he is 23 + 6 = 29 years old.

Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 23. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

So, the population of Chile now is 138000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D. There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for D, we need to get a common denominator for the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\).

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate how many marbles Solomon got from his father. He got 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna, we calculate:

\[ \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He added 20 marbles to the store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ kgs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 140 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

12"
"If the classroom has 30 boys and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then the number of girls is:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, then the number of nongendered children is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{10} = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[ 123 \]"
"If the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3 and there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by understanding that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole.

To find the number of poles, we divide the total number of wires by 3:
\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Total number of wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people left

This means that 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can find out how many men left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

25 men - 22 men = 3 men left

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Now, we can find out how many women are left by subtracting the number of women who left from the total number of women:

15 women - 7 women = 8 women

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, we need to find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost as follows:

\[ \text{Magazine cost} = \frac{\text{Book cost}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Pen cost} = \text{Magazine cost} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils. So, the total number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils as the ones Jam has in her boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, we'll assume each box holds the same number of pencils as the total number of pencils Jam has in her boxes, which is 24 pencils per box.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed for Jam's 26 pencils. Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we need to see how many boxes are needed for 26 pencils. Since 26 pencils cannot be exactly divided into boxes of 24, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, Jam needs 2 boxes to store her pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. If each box can hold 24 pencils, then the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils is:

\[ \lceil \frac{46}{24} \rceil = \lceil 1.9167 \rceil = 2 \]

So, Jam needs 2 boxes and Meg needs 2 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's calculate the weakening of the coffee due to cooling by 65 degrees. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. So, for 65 degrees:

\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to adding 15 milliliters of cream. This adds an additional 15 milliliters to the weakening:

\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 860 \text{ milliliters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 860 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and each person can get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring, then the total number of old records brought in is:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior and senior programmers there are.

The total number of employees is 100. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We are told that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the 8 he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. In the morning, he eats 2 more, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final numerical answer is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charge. To find out how much more it needs to charge, we subtract the current charge from the full charge:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge 40 percentage points, we divide 40 by 1:

40 ÷ 1 = 40 intervals

Since each interval is 3 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 3 to find the total time in minutes:

40 intervals × 3 minutes/interval = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and gets 10 more, so she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. After giving 3 lollipops to Ella, she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's see how many rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. Using the same reward system:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2 \text{ rewards with a remainder} \]

This means they earned 2 rewards, which means they get $2 off their next purchase.

Now, they used their rewards from the last trip, which was $4 off, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid after applying the rewards and the coupon:

\[ 43 - 2 - 4 = 37 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid 37 dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \]

Now, we find the difference in net pay between Job B and Job A:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"First, let's find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins.

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 44 unmanned ruined castles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to find out the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have together. 

Nick has 10 guns.
Richard has 5 guns.
DJ has 8 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.

Adding these together:
10 + 5 + 8 + 1 = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

For the suckers:
- Each batch needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces.

For the fudge:
- Each batch needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, after the first year, the value of her 8 shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, after the second year, the value of her 8 shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate Thomas's hot dogs as follows:

Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * 2
Thomas's hot dogs = 6

Now, let's find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:

John's hot dogs = Thomas's hot dogs / 2
John's hot dogs = 6 / 2
John's hot dogs = 3

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

More hot dogs John ate than Luke = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 3 - 2
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 1

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The third group, which is the smallest, will then have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, which is \( C + 2C = 3C \).
4. We know the total number of animals is 60, so \( 3C = 60 \).
5. Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 20 \). So, there are 20 cows.
6. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, there are \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.
7. Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
8. Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs for the chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \).
9. Adding the legs of the cows and chickens together, we get \( 80 + 80 = 160 \).

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). So, the total number of balls he would have is:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (added balls) = 7 balls

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

Josh starts juggling with 4 balls."
"First, let's determine the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of one of each animal:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together:

50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The container itself weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:

240 + 20 = 260 pounds

The final numerical answer is 260 pounds."
"Laurel initially received 24 outfits from her friend. At her baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 24 * 2 = 48 outfits. Her mom gifted her with 15 outfits. Adding all these together, we get 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits.

The final numerical answer is 87."
"First, we need to find out how many meters Tyson runs if he follows his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson runs 5000 meters every day, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, if Tyson follows the coach's advice, he will run:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, the total distance he covers in June is:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 180000 \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies she puts in her son's lunch box and the cookies her husband eats from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount on $60 is:

\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

So, the total discount is $24. To find out how much Davos paid after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate how much they made per day when they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much they make per day now that they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making now compared to when they made tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first find out how much she spends on food, treats, and medicine in a month and then multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

So, the total monthly cost for food, treats, and medicine is:
\[ 100 + 20 + 100 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she spends in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 120 \times 12 = 1440 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
1440"
"Let's break down the activities and their durations:

- Monday: Yoga class - 1 hour
- Tuesday: Cooking class - 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: Cheese-tasting event - 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Museum tour - half the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: Errands - 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:

\[ \text{Total plant pots needed} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Plant pots bought} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater which cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent or given away is $11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent or given away from the initial amount:

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (spent/given away) = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The 6 hours of watching shows is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's find the total time he spent.

Let \( T \) be the total time he spent. Then:
0.30 * \( T \) = 6 hours
\( T \) = 6 hours / 0.30
\( T \) = 20 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his total time was spent sightseeing. Let's calculate the time spent sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * \( T \)
Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 20 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

So, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earned from both jobs:

\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's find the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet tall} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought. We add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28, spent $17 on toys, and then his mother gave him an extra $10. So, the amount of money Dean has left is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
The cost for two rides on the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and snacks.

The budget is $90, and the cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $25, so the remaining budget is $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this from the remaining budget to find out how much is left for snacks and other expenses.

The remaining budget after buying arcade tokens is $65 - $5 = $60.

Since the question asks how many friends she can invite, and we don't have any information about the cost of snacks or other expenses for the friends, we can assume that the $60 is enough for snacks and other expenses for her and her friends.

If we assume that the cost for each person (including Morgan) to have snacks and other expenses is the same, then we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person.

However, since the cost per person is not specified, we can only say that she can invite as many friends as the remaining budget allows, assuming the cost per person is the same as the cost for one person (which is $5 for arcade tokens).

So, the number of friends she can invite is $60 / $5 = 12 friends.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost for 4 lollipops is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Now, let's find out how much money Marisa has after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so her savings after buying the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This $4 is the amount she saves in her piggy bank each day. Over 5 days, the total amount saved in her piggy bank is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \]

So, Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he started with $10, the total amount he spent on candy and gumballs is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

This means Billy spent $8 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

So, Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy. Let's confirm this by stating the final numerical answer:

\[ 5.33 \]"
"To solve this, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say Carver's son's age is \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, second to third, and third back to first) is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles/service = 0.0375 service intervals/day.

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of 0.0375:
1 ÷ 0.0375 = 26.6667 days.

Since the train can't go for a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 27 days.

So, the train goes between services every 27 days."
"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. So, the average is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average stuffing} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now we know that a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds. Since each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing and Mark is making 4 chihuahua beds:

\[ \text{Total stuffing for chihuahuas} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the collie beds. Since each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing and Mark is making 3 collie beds:

\[ \text{Total stuffing for collies} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total stuffing needed for the chihuahuas and the collies to get the final amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[ \text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time for the trip, we add the time spent driving to his friend's house, the time spent on the detour, and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2.857 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip took approximately 8.857 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders to find the number of boys.

Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Now, we know that on Friday, 5 girls were absent. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, we can find out how many boys were present by subtracting the absent girls from the total absentees and then subtracting that from the total number of boys.

Absent boys = Total absentees - Absent girls
Absent boys = 5 + 4
Absent boys = 9

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 9
Number of boys present = 44

The final numerical answer is 44."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

On her first test, Jane scored 15 points.
On her second test, she scored 18 points.

So, the total points from the first two tests is:
15 + 18 = 33 points.

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests to pass. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:

42 - 33 = 9 points.

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). So, \( C = 3 \).

The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, let's add up all the people kicked out for specific reasons:
\[ C + \text{shoplifting} + \text{physical violence} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Since the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points after scoring these 24 points. So, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract the 14 points from her current total:

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20 and there's an additional 20% for etching. So, the total cost for each frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for all the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To find out the total cost Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The savings from the DIY option is 20% of $400. So, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ \text{Savings} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost Ethan would pay:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
On Saturday, they sold double the number of Friday, so they sold 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.
On Sunday, they sold half the number of Saturday, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
Six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.
In total, the store sold 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs of tennis shoes.
The final numerical answer is 50."
"Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which means she had 1 * 2 = 2 hours of practice on Saturdays. 

To find out how many hours a week she had dance practice, we add up the hours from each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours a week.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning.

Total cost of equipment = $400,000

Percentage of functioning pieces = 100% - 40% = 60%

Now, we calculate the cost of the functioning pieces:

Cost of functioning pieces = 60% of $400,000

Cost of functioning pieces = 0.60 * $400,000

Cost of functioning pieces = $240,000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets milk from 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, she gets 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces."
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we have:

\[ \text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:

\[ \text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining pupils like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we have:

\[ \text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ \text{Pupils who like yellow} = 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money she got by the price per apple.

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means she picked:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"First, let's figure out how many socks Lindsay has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. So, 10 pairs of socks would be:
10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

She also has 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

Now, let's find out how many socks Lindsay has missed by subtracting the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing.

Total socks that need washing = 50 socks
Socks washed = 35 socks

Socks missed = Total socks that need washing - Socks washed
Socks missed = 50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. Her brother ate 44 of those cookies. Therefore, Rachel has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to get the total amount she will pay back. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find out the monthly payment.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Here, the principal is $3,650, the interest rate is 10% (or 0.10 as a decimal), and the time is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period of 5 months. However, for simplicity, we can use the annual rate directly in our calculation as the time period is less than a year.

Let's calculate the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times 0.10 \times 5) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times 0.50) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5475 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed = 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed = 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
- Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's calculate how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of pesos they have together.

Axel's total:
\[ 50 \text{ silver pesos} + 80 \text{ gold pesos} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

Anna's total:
\[ 100 \text{ silver pesos} + 120 \text{ gold pesos} = 220 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding their totals together:
\[ 130 + 220 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, she can make:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we know that she spent $18 to buy the supplies. To find her profit, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to understand that he sold 3/5 of his land and was left with 2/5 of his land. If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, we can set up a simple equation to find out the total amount of land he had initially.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, 2/5 of \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares. So we can write the equation as:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the right side of the equation:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. The final numerical answer is:

\[
32
\]"
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and half are girls, the other half must be boys. So, the number of boys is also 26.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. So, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 female members can't make it:

Number of female members who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13

This means the number of female members who do make it to the performance is:

Number of female members who make it = 26 - 13 = 13

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of female members who make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we add up all the scores:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 300

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, Wilson's current math grade is 60."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is:
6 erasers * $2/eraser = $12

The cost of 8 pencils is:
8 pencils * $3/pencil = $24

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils:
$12 + $24 = $36

So, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu received. Since Mr. Yu received 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivered is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and she needs 9 rides. So, she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost for Dasha is 18 * $2 = $36.

Now, let's see how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. David spends $30 on the ride bracelet, while Dasha spends $36 on tickets. The difference between what Dasha spends and what David spends is the amount David saves.

So, the amount David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Now, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have. The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles is 165.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Next, we find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts: 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles per part.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20 a month.

With a 20% savings, the savings amount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the cost after the savings is $20 - $4 = $16 a month for Hulu and Disney Plus.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month.

So, the total cost for streaming services is $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $10 (Netflix) = $26 a month.

Tim used to pay $60 a month for cable, so the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is $60 - $26 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, so:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \frac{90 \times 100}{450} = \frac{9000}{450} = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of spaces available in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of spaces is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in this shelving system. So, we first calculate double the number of spaces:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"Erica initially made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which totals 24 + 5 = 29 cards. She also received 17 cards from family and friends. To find out how many cards Erica now has, we add the cards she made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received, and then subtract the cards she passed out.

So, the total number of cards Erica has now is 20 (made) + 30 (brought by dad) + 17 (received) - 29 (passed out) = 38 cards."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza:
1/3 * 12 slices = 4 slices

Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza:
1/4 * 12 slices = 3 slices

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
4 slices + 3 slices = 7 slices

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract those from the total:
12 slices - 7 slices - 2 slices = 3 slices

So, the number of slices left is 3."
"Mark needs $300 - $50 = $250 more to buy the bike.
He earns $10 per day.
So, he needs $250 / $10 = 25 days to save the money.

The final answer is 25 days."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs Nancy saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate it as:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs Nancy saw, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to find out the total amount of milk John drank. He drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total amount of milk he drinks is:

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Next, we need to calculate the total calories from the milk. Since each ounce of milk has 3 calories, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, the final numerical answer is 48 calories."
"First, let's calculate how many days the builder works in a month:

He works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week, so:
4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

Now, let's calculate how many days he works in a year:

There are 12 months in a year, so:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

He gets paid $50 every day, so:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14400/year

So, the final numerical answer is $14400."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the ingredients by 4.

For flour:
Normal recipe calls for 3 cups, so for a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour.

For milk:
Normal recipe calls for 1 cup, so for a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so for 12 cups of flour, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so for 4 cups of milk, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day before the reduction. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts and it runs for 8 hours a day, the energy used in one day is:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day after the reduction. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new usage time is:

\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the energy used in one day after the reduction is:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the energy saved in one day:

\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:

\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:

\[ 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 135 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
34 (from the first two zebras) + 36 (from the second zebra) + 18 (from the third zebra) = 88 stripes in total.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra on average.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has initially is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these to the corns he already had, the total number of corns he has now is:

\[ \text{Total number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the total number of corns and the new total number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Total number of corns and cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps there and 5,000 steps back. Adding the 1,000 steps he walked with his friend, we get:

\[ 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 = 11,000 \]

But he only had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he took:

\[ 11,000 - 10,000 = 1,000 \]

So, Elliott took 1,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
- The book is 45 pages long.
- Each page has 200 words.
So, the total number of words in the book is \(45 \times 200 = 9000\) words.

Next, let's find out how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
So, the time it takes to read the book is \(9000 \div 300 = 30\) minutes.

Toby plans to leave the place where he is reading the book 10 minutes before he reaches the airport. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes. Therefore, he will leave at \(60 - 10 = 50\) minutes.

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he leaves. So, he will be \(50 - 30 = 20\) minutes early.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carolyn's company paid in May.

Each employee works 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600/\text{week} \]

Since there were 40 employees in May, the total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$24,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money paid in June. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means that 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, 30 employees' contracts remained valid in June. The weekly pay for these 30 employees is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$18,000 \]

Since June has 4 weeks, the total pay for the 30 employees in June is:
\[ \$18,000/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$72,000 \]

Now, we add the total pay from May and June to find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months:
\[ \$24,000 + \$72,000 = \$96,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$96,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold at ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, for 2 pounds, the cost would be:

- First pound costs $3.
- Second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Adding these together, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and each magnet costs $0.25. Since Sally bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:

- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10:

$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is:

$400 + $800 = $1200

Now, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200:

20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240

So, the discount on the fireworks is $240. To find out the cost of the fireworks after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:

$1200 - $240 = $960

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the fireworks after the discount to the cost of the finale firework:

$960 + $150 = $1110

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make for 60 cookies, we divide:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many candles are both dangerous and defective. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect. Since Marcy's 99% guarantee means that 1% of the candles are both dangerous and defective, we can calculate the number of defective candles as follows:

First, find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \]

Since 1% of these dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we calculate the number of defective candles:
\[ 2500 \times 0.01 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. If the regular price is $20 and there's a 30% off sale, the discount amount for each blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$20 - \$6 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$14 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 60 apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 45 apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees.
7. The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

First, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne:
- From the tallest trees: 30 apples
- From the shortest trees: 15 apples
- From the average trees: Let's call this number \( A \)

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is \( 30 + 15 + A \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister:
- From the tallest trees: 60 apples
- From the shortest trees: 45 apples
- From the average trees: 0 apples

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is \( 60 + 45 + 0 \).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"To solve this, let's use algebra. Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries. We know that each camel has 1 head and 0 bumps, and each dromedary has 1 head and 1 bump. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ 0c + 1d = 304 \]
or simply,
\[ d = 304 \]

Now, we substitute \( d = 304 \) into the first equation:
\[ c + 304 = 180 \]
\[ c = 180 - 304 \]
\[ c = -124 \]

Since the number of camels cannot be negative, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the interpretation. However, based on the given conditions, the number of dromedaries is:
\[ d = 304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
304"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, in the next two days, he traveled 240 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the first six days:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

On the seventh day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for the seventh day is 0 km. For the eighth day, he traveled 300 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the entire trip:

\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1340 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 1340 \text{ km} \]"
"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, let's break down the information given:

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker.

First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is:
- Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]
So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Next, let's find out how big Timothy's locker is:
- Since Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches and it's half as big as Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]
So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find Stanley's comb, Oliver needs to climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet. The difference in elevation is 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet. 

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet."
"The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 * $4000 = $8000. So in total, he got $4000 + $8000 = $12000. If he initially had $5000, then now he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000."
"First, let's calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats taken away is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. The problem states that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 cats:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, let's break it down month by month.

For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 per month:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24 \]

After 8 months, the cost increases to $14 per month. We need to calculate the cost for the remaining 12 months (months 9 through 20):
\[ 12 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$168 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$24 + \$168 = \$240 \]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \$240."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that, so:

Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6 = $22

Now, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans:
Total cost = Cost of tattered jeans + Cost of jogger jeans
Total cost = $28 + $22 = $50

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is:
Amount saved from jogger jeans = 1/3 * $6 = $2

And the amount saved from the tattered jeans is:
Amount saved from tattered jeans = Total savings - Amount saved from jogger jeans
Amount saved from tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4

Now, let's find out how much Cole originally paid for the jogger jeans. Since he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original cost of the jogger jeans is:
Original cost of jogger jeans = Cost of jogger jeans + Amount saved from jogger jeans
Original cost of jogger jeans = $22 + $2 = $24

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. So, we subtract the original cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of the jogger jeans:
Difference = Original cost of jogger jeans - Original cost of tattered jeans
Difference = $24 - $28 = -$4

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and we got a negative number, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. The difference is $4 more for the tattered jeans."
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses.
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses.
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans.
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so they attract a total of 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds. The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 birds + 10 birds = 30 birds each. Since she made 3 such feeders, they attract a total of 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds. Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds each day in her garden."
"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + 25% of the cost of bagel
Cost of soup = $4 + 0.25 * $4
Cost of soup = $4 + $1
Cost of soup = $5

Now, we know the cost of the cake is half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

Cost of cake = 1/2 * Cost of bagel
Cost of cake = 1/2 * $4
Cost of cake = $2

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2
Total cost = $11

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"First, let's determine how much money Kenny made from selling his Pokemon cards. He got $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100, so he must have made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the total money he made by the price per card. So, $50 / $1.5 = 33.3333...

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means he sold 33 cards.

Now, we know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. If 2/3 of his cards is equal to 33 cards, we can find out the total number of cards he started with by setting up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Cards} = 33 \]

To find the total number of cards, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

\[ \text{Total Cards} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and we've already rounded down the number of cards sold, the total number of cards Kenny started with is 49."
"First, let's calculate how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests initially, so half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. If each of these 18 guests was to have two hotdogs, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that 40 - 36 = 4 extra hotdogs were needed. Since each of the 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the letters in Indras' name to the letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

So, the final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we calculate how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the gallons by 8 to get the pints:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 120 cents is equal to 1.20 dollars. George spent 1.20 dollars on chips. He started with 5 dollars and had 1% of his money left after the purchase. This means he spent 99% of his money. Let's calculate how much money he had left:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since 1% of his money is 0.01 dollars, 99% of his money is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 0.01 \text{ dollars} = 4.99 \text{ dollars} \]

This confirms that he spent 1.20 dollars on chips. Now, let's find out how much money he had left after buying the chips:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he had 3.80 dollars left after buying the chips, we can now calculate how much money he spent on candy bars. He spent 1.20 dollars on chips, so the remaining money is:

\[ 3.80 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 2.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is 0.75 dollars. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{2.60 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = \frac{2.60}{0.75} = \frac{260}{75} = \frac{52}{15} \approx 3.4667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 3 candy bars. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

He shared these equally among his four friends, so each friend received:

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory and her mom each have a piece, so together they have 2 pieces. The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so there are 8 - 2 = 6 pieces left. The cake weighs 20 ounces, so the remaining cake weighs 20 - (20/8 * 2) = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris together have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.
Including their 6 friends, there are 6 + 2 = 8 people in total.
To share the oranges equally, each person will get 56 / 8 = 7 oranges.
The final answer is 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

\[ \text{Bernadette's drive time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's drive time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave to account for her longer drive time.

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave early} = \text{Wayne's drive time} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the area of the rectangle is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can find the width by using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
98"
"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads:

Elizabeth's beads = 1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear
Elizabeth's beads = 1 * 20 + 2 * 20
Elizabeth's beads = 20 + 40
Elizabeth's beads = 60

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought. She bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads:

Margareth's beads = 3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red
Margareth's beads = 3 * 20 + 4 * 20
Margareth's beads = 60 + 80
Margareth's beads = 140

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

More beads = Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads
More beads = 140 - 60
More beads = 80

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total temperature decrease from the window is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add the temperature increase from the oven and subtract the temperature decrease from the window from the initial temperature of the house:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:
\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took into minutes for easier calculation:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Jon took:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time James takes for the run as \( R \) minutes. The total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.25 hours is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to calculate how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the distance covered is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael gets is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She has 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass: 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

So, the final numerical answer is 2 trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

Joey's initial points: 214

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning:

Joey's new score: 240
Marcy's new score: 235

Difference in points = Joey's new score - Marcy's new score
Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48 \text{ sneakers}} = \$12 \text{ per sneaker} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the flash sale:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \text{ sneakers} \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 \text{ sneakers} - 17 \text{ sneakers} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's add the revenue from both sales to find the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ sneakers} \times \$12 = \$576 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down:

6 packets * 8 pieces/packet = 48 pieces

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, let's add them together:
48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

So, Beatrice bought 112 pieces of crayons in all.

The final numerical answer is 112."
"Let's break down the costs:

- Super ticket cost: $20
- Extra cost for popcorn with soda: $1
- Total cost for super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

- Movie ticket cost: $12
- Popcorn and soda cost: $3 (soda) + regular price of popcorn (let's call this P) = $3 + P
- Total cost for movie ticket and popcorn and soda: $12 + $3 + P = $15 + P

You saved $2 by choosing the movie ticket and popcorn and soda over the super ticket, so:

- Super ticket cost - Movie ticket and popcorn and soda cost = Savings
- $21 - ($15 + P) = $2
- $21 - $15 - P = $2
- $6 - P = $2
- P = $6 - $2
- P = $4

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"First, we need to find out the original cost to fill one balloon. Since the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing $900 by 20.

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

After two days, the cost to fill each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by 170.

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 65 \times 170 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 65 \times 170 = 65 \times (17 \times 10) = (65 \times 17) \times 10 \]

First, calculate \(65 \times 17\):

\[ 65 \times 17 = 65 \times (10 + 7) = (65 \times 10) + (65 \times 7) = 650 + 455 = 1105 \]

Now, multiply by 10:

\[ 1105 \times 10 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

Now, let's add these distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

Next, we calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]
Since these 2 rubies are worth the same as the 3 sapphires, each ruby is worth:
\[ \frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate it step by step.

First, let's find out how many apples both of them eat in one day:
- Marin eats 4 apples a day.
- Nancy eats 4 apples a day.

So together, they eat:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples per day} \]

Now, to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by 30:
\[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what a raised bed is) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So, for one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, then the number of green cards is:

\[ \text{Green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Yellow cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the red, green, and yellow cards together:

\[ \text{Total cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} + \text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 78."

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of spotted puppies. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

For cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 cans of soda a week.
So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from cans each week.

For bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week.
So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles to find out how much she earns in one week:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in four weeks = Weekly earnings \(\times\) 4
- Total earnings in four weeks = \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 84 cents."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.60 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants."

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If her students got ten cards each, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student received:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky received a $1 discount, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:

"First, let's break down the laundry items per room:

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up the laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces.

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of laundry pieces in 80 rooms is:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces.

So, the final numerical answer is 1200."
"First, let's calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gains from Monday to Friday.

He gets 5 pairs on Monday. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ shoes} \]

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs. So, he gains:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ shoes} \]

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs. So, he gains:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ shoes} \]

Now, let's add up all the shoes he gains from Monday to Friday:
\[ 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Initially, he has 200 shoes. After gaining 100 shoes, he will have:
\[ 200 + 100 = 300 \text{ shoes} \]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, the number of shoes he will have after Saturday is:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, to find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he will walk in three weeks. Since he walks 4 days a week, we calculate the total number of days as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 60 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can calculate the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that number from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this:

- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Kids allergic to both: 3

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = (\text{Allergic to dairy}) + (\text{Allergic to peanuts}) - (\text{Allergic to both}) \]
\[ = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."
"Each group has 200 employees and 7 tour guides, so the total number of people in each group is 200 + 7. Since there are 3 groups, we multiply the total number of people in one group by 3.

200 + 7 = 207 people in each group.
207 * 3 = 621 people in total.

So, the final numerical answer is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each get a ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price for the hotel per day is $1500. So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"
"First, let's find out how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and Jasper has half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Jasper's blue paint} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes} \]

Next, let's find out how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint and Jasper has three times as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes} \]

Now, to find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint together:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \text{ tubes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny} \]

Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 2010 penny} + \text{Weight of 1959 penny} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more songs each can add to their player. Both players can store up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel, the number of songs he can still add is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

For Luri, the number of songs he can still add is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, so the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[ \text{Total money given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to find out what 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we multiply $80 by 3:

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -28

Now, we divide the sum by the number of places, which is 3:
-28 ÷ 3 = -9.3333...

The average highest temperature is approximately -9.33 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate how much more money he needs. The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so:

\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

He saves $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take him to save $8, we divide the remaining amount by the amount he saves each day:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\$8}{\$2 \text{ per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts. Since each pack costs $4.00 and she's buying 2 packs, the total cost would be:
\[ 4.00 \times 2 = 8.00 \]

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. For every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 price:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost per razor. Since she's getting 2 packs, which contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack), the cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \]

The cost per razor in dollars is $0.25, which is equivalent to 25 cents. So, the final answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60"" tall. 

The total height of the 9 cheerleaders is \(9 \times 64 = 576\) inches. Adding the height of the shortest cheerleader, the total height is \(576 + 60 = 636\) inches.

The average height of the cheerleaders is \(\frac{636}{10} = 63.6\) inches.

Now, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. So, the total height is the sum of the heights of these 10 girls.

The total height of the pyramid is \(4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\) inches.

To convert the height of the pyramid from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

So, the height of the pyramid in feet is \(\frac{636}{12} = 53\) feet.

The final numerical answer is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total minutes she walks in one day by multiplying 8 hours by 5 minutes per hour.

8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day

Now, to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days, we multiply the daily walking minutes by 5.

40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"First, let's determine how old Brett will be in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be:

14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the question, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times that age is:

3 * 14 = 42 years old.

So, Angela will be 42 years old in four years. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract four years from her age in four years:

42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost for each type of ride and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for morning rides is \(28 \times 6 = 168\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for afternoon rides is \(28 \times 2 = 56\).

Now, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

"To solve this, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then find the number of guests where these costs are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue:
- The cost is a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs $5 for food.
- So, the total cost at the first venue is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per guest.
- Food is included in the $25 per guest.
- So, the total cost at the second venue is \( 25n \).

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) where the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10."
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found D + 7 insects. It's also stated that David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found B insects, then David found B/2 insects. Since David found D insects, we can equate D to B/2, which means B = 2D.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So we can write the equation as:
\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]

Since B = 2D, we can substitute B in the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ \text{Lily's insects} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought four packs of gum.
- Two packs were strawberry.
- One pack was grape, costing $2.
- One pack was green apple, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost was $7.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberry gum:

- The total cost for the packs is $7.
- The cost for the grape pack is $2.
- The cost for the green apple pack is $1.

So, the cost for the two strawberry packs is $7 - $2 - $1 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost per pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

$24 ÷ $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

$24 ÷ $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8

To get the most popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 pieces. He can get 200 sticks from each 2 x 4 piece.

So, if he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4, he can get:

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1200."
"Each dog has 4 legs, so for 6 dogs, that's 6 * 4 = 24 legs in total. Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, to cover 24 legs, he would need 24 / 4 = 6 pairs of snowshoes. Therefore, the total cost would be 6 * $12.00 = $72.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each week without a pass.

She takes 2 bus trips a day and does this 5 days a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times $2.20/\text{trip} = $22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the savings per week would be:
\[ $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep because half of 30 is 15.
The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows because twice 30 is 60.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is 8 * $4 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so her total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

The final numerical answer is $288."

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:

- Sweaters: 3
- Mittens: 3 (since it's a pair)
- Socks: 3 (since it's a pair)

Now, let's calculate the total number of each item's wool needed:

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, let's add up all the skeins of wool needed:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate how many problems Chris completes on Tuesday. Since he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, we can calculate the number of problems he completes on Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Problems on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many problems are left after Monday and Tuesday. Initially, Chris has 100 problems. After Monday, he has:

\[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]

After Tuesday, he completes 36 more problems, so the number of problems left is:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

After Wednesday, the number of problems left to complete is:

\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

\[ 39 \]"
"First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour by all four is \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread they have left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold and returned:
93 loaves in the morning + 39 loaves in the afternoon + 6 loaves returned = 138 loaves

Now, subtract this from the total number of loaves baked:
200 loaves baked - 138 loaves sold and returned = 62 loaves left

So, the final numerical answer is 62."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of red tulips is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of blue tulips is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips together:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much raisins Heather has for each item. Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3.

Total raisins = 27 cups

Raisins per item = Total raisins / 3
Raisins per item = 27 / 3
Raisins per item = 9 cups

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we divide the raisins per item by the amount needed for one batch.

Number of batches = Raisins per item / Raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 36/3
Number of batches = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the cost per day:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Total daily cost: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $21

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- There are 7 days in a week
- Weekly cost: $21 * 7 = $147

To find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to know the weekly cost before adding the new device. Since Ada's daily consumption was 12 kilowatts per hour, the cost per day would be:
- Daily cost before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $18

And the weekly cost before adding the new device:
- Weekly cost before adding the new device: $18 * 7 = $126

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint 1/10 of the house (since 1/2 divided by 5 equals 1/10).

So, if 5 people are working together, they can paint 5 times as much in the same amount of time. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint 5/10 or 1/2 of the house.

To paint a whole house, 5 people would need 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take 5 people 2 * 24 = 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"If Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, then she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together.

Ophelia's total: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42
Jenna's total: 66 chairs

Total for both: 42 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 108

So, the final numerical answer is 108."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set, we first need to determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the headphone set cost:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week. We know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. For two weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week, and for one week, he worked out for 6 hours. Let's calculate the total:

1. For the 6 weeks he worked out 4 hours each week:
   \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours

2. For the 2 weeks he worked out 5 hours each week:
   \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours

3. For the 1 week he worked out 6 hours:
   \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of hours:
\(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is 48 - 8 + 40 = 80.

On the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is 80 - 21 + 7 = 66.

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - At that time, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, his cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is 22 years old now.
   - His cousin is 47 years old now.
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors. The total cost is $2,400. So, if we let the cost of one monitor be \( x \), then the total cost equation is:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2x = 600 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many boys and girls there are. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls and the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 840, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(31 \times 2 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total she needs to make.

Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs needed: 72

Vlogs still needed: 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. The dinner bill is $50.

So, the tip is 20/100 * $50 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find out the total amount you need to pay.

Total amount = Dinner bill + Tip
Total amount = $50 + $10 = $60.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. 

Each boy gets: $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share, so he now has:
$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share, so he now has:
$11 + $10 = $21

He then spends $8, so he has:
$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has:
$13 * 3 = $39

So, the final numerical answer is $39."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand that April has 30 days. The second half of the month would be from day 16 to day 30, which is 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Let's assume he saves \(x\) dollars daily in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the second half, he would save \(2x\) dollars daily.

The total savings for the month should be $1125. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Total savings} = (\text{first half savings}) + (\text{second half savings}) \]

Since the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days, we can write:

\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 daily in the first half of the month. For the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus gets for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny gets for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as B dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets 4B dollars. The total amount they get together is 100 dollars. So we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find B, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 6 miles each day to and from work. Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply 6 miles by 5.

6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

So, the final numerical answer is 30 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice in full. So, for the first two times, she writes \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
3. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes \(13\) letters.
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes the 52 letters she wrote in the first two steps again.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First two times: \(52\) letters
- Writing half of the alphabet: \(13\) letters
- Re-writing everything: \(52\) letters

So, the total number of letters she has written is \(52 + 13 + 52 = 117\).

The final numerical answer is 117."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 families * 3 = 9 new calls.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 families * 3 = 27 new calls.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so that's 27 families * 3 = 81 new calls.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds during his illness. If his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight. So, his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds."
"First, let's determine how many toys are needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so a play set five times larger would have:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, if \( x \) is the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12: \(12\)
- One geometry set at $10: \(10\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\(7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\)

The total cost before the discount is $20. Now, we apply the 10% discount:

\(10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\)

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\(20 - 2 = 18\)

So, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:
5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the potato fries:
10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks:
5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add up the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
Change = $50 - Total cost
Change = $50 - $33 = $17

So, the final numerical answer is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the base commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the base commission.

Let's calculate each part:

- Base commission for the first $1000: $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300
- Additional commission for the amount over $1000: $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total commission:

Total commission = Base commission + Additional commission
Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate how many bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles he needs for his 70 guests. He wants to have 2 bottles per guest, so:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes in cold water. So, we calculate twice the cold time and then add 2 minutes:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water conditions.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:

\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, let's find out how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80}{40} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, we subtract the 7 from the total:

21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with two holes:

7 buttons * 2 holes per button = 14 holes.

Then, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with four holes:

14 buttons * 4 holes per button = 56 holes.

Finally, we add the two totals together to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we can denote it as \( R \). Octavia drinks half of this amount, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended daily intake from the amount he currently drinks:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since we don't have the exact value of \( R \), we can't calculate the exact number of cups. However, the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the recommended daily intake. If we assume the recommended daily intake is \( R \), then Juan needs to reduce his intake by:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

But since the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the recommended daily intake, we can express the reduction as:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (which would make the recommended intake 4 cups, but this is not necessary for the calculation as it cancels out in the reduction formula), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Susan's weight = 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 130 pounds * 2 = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds
- Susan weighs 130 pounds
- Bob weighs 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up their weights and divide by the number of friends:

Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds = 540 pounds
Number of friends = 3
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 pounds / 3 = 180 pounds

The final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"To solve this, we need to understand how the angle changes over time. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour upward from the pyramid. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at a 32-degree angle from the ground, and it moves upward for 10 hours, we can calculate the new angle by adding the movement to the initial angle.

The calculation is as follows:
Initial angle from the ground = 32 degrees
Movement of the sun = 5 degrees per hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

New angle from the ground = Initial angle + Movement of the sun
New angle from the ground = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, the final numerical answer is 82 degrees."
"To solve this, let's first find out how old the two sons are. If one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, then the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, James needs candles for both sons. So, he needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 8 candles for the 8-year-old, which totals 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week.

She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, so:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights/week} = 105 \text{ minutes/week} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes she read in the second week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes to read 1 page, we divide 1.5 minutes by 2 pages:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ pages}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes/page} \]

To find out how many minutes it takes to read 100 pages, we multiply 0.75 minutes/page by 100 pages:
\[ 0.75 \text{ minutes/page} \times 100 \text{ pages} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the minutes she read in the first week to the minutes she read in the second week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} + 75 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Judy read a total of 180 pages in two weeks."
"Cody ate 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.
Together, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.
So, 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches are left.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
3. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( x \). So, we have the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3x
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{51}{3} = 17
   \]
   So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old.
5. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:
   \[
   17 - 7 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To solve this, let's break down the payments Sharon received from the tooth fairy:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, she received $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount per tooth as she did for the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, she received $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money Sharon received:
$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information given.

1. We know Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"First, let's calculate how much Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we multiply 21 by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

So Mitchell made $84 that weekend.

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

84 - 63 = 21

So Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam."
"First, let's calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each costs $5.

Number of wooden action figures bought = 4 (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)
Total cost for wooden action figures = 4 * $5 = $20

Now, let's see how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures.

Money left after buying wooden action figures = $70 - $20 = $50

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

Number of plastic action figures he can buy = $50 / $2 = 25

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week.

Total number of action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures
Total number of action figures = 4 + 25 = 29

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 29."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the spaying:
- Spaying cost: $200

Next, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines:
- Cost per vaccine: $20
- Number of vaccines: 3
- Total cost for vaccines: $20 * 3 = $60

Now, let's calculate the cost of repairing the broken vases:
- Cost per vase: $12
- Number of vases: 4
- Total cost for repairing vases: $12 * 4 = $48

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Spaying cost: $200
- Vaccines cost: $60
- Vase repair cost: $48

Total cost: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

The final numerical answer is $308."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week.
The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, but the flower shops order 65 roses per week. This means Ford lacks:
65 - 40 = 25 roses per week.

To find out how many roses he lacks in a month, we need to multiply the weekly shortage by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:
25 * 4 = 100 roses.

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount removed over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times $100/\text{month} = $2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
\[ $3000 - $2400 = $600 \]

So, the final amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is:
\[ $600 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of bread and cheese for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since 10 sandwiches are made from 1 loaf, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.

The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $37.00."
"First, we need to find out how many crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons she can melt to make one muffin. Since each muffin requires 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if she can sell each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for new carpet and padding} = 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to add up all the birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

On days one and two, he saw 50 birds.
On day three, he saw 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

First, let's add up all the birds:
50 (day 1) + 50 (day 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 330 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):
330 birds ÷ 7 days = 47.1428571429

Rounding to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 47.14."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
3. Adding this half value to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
4. Dividing this sum by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
5. Now, we need to subtract 12 from the starting value, which is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
6. Finally, we multiply the value we got from step 4 by the value we got from step 5, which is \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature:
Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage difference = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
Percentage difference = (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we apply this 4% difference to the 520 degrees required by the recipe:
4% of 520 = (4 / 100) * 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, the temperature Maggie should set her oven to is:
520 + 20.8 = 540.8

The final numerical answer is 540.8."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we can calculate the price of Juan's house by subtracting 30% of $76,000 from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, the price of Juan's house is:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 129200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups, which is 40 - 12 = 28 more cups. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than cups, so she brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes. The total number of cups brought by the two is 12 + 40 = 52 cups. The total number of dishes brought by the two is 24 + 60 = 84 dishes. The total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 84 = 136."
"First, let's calculate the discount on one box of contacts. If the original price of one box is $100.00 and there is a 10% discount, the discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs Pete gets is:

\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

At $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

Now, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

At $10 an hour, John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories burned from running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 \) ml.

Now, let's calculate the final amount:
- \( \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \) ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is 4500. So we can write the equation:

\[0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[3B = 4500\]

Solving for B:

\[B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500\]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Red jelly beans = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
- Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[1515 - 1485 = 30\]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's calculate the increase in Jared's typing speed. He increased from 47 WPM to 52 WPM, which is an increase of 5 words per minute. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 \text{ WPM} + 5 \text{ WPM} = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have three measurements of his typing speed: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and then divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Adding the numbers together:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, dividing by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"First, let's calculate the weight loss Martin would experience if he eats Cheerios every day for 5 weeks. Since he loses 1.25 pounds per week, we multiply this by 5:

\[ 1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate the weight gain Martin would experience if he eats donuts every day for 5 weeks. Since he gains 1.75 pounds per week, we multiply this by 5:

\[ 1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:

\[ 8.75 \, \text{pounds} - 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 2.5 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people Alex will have invited through email. She invited 100 people, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the number of friends invited is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Next, we add the 10 friends she called to invite:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Out of these 10 friends, 8 of them bring their spouses. So, the number of spouses is:
\[ 8 \]

Now, we add the spouses to the total number of people invited:
\[ 210 + 8 = 218 \]

So, Alex will need 218 seats for the event."
"First, let's determine the weight of each dog step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The boots cost $16.
- Shipping costs $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- Shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com, we subtract the total cost on Amazon.com from the total cost on eBay:
$21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this, let's first understand the growth pattern of the beanstalk. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We need to find out on which day its height will be greater than 20 feet, which is the height of Mark's window.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On the third day, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet Mark's window is off the ground.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, to find out how much protein is in 200 grams, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of protein}}{200 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 200}{100} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day. Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation to find \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy with the money he has.

He has 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total amount of money from quarters is:
\[ 8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents} \]

He has 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total amount of money from dimes is:
\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

He has 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, the total amount of money from nickels is:
\[ 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

He has 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent. So, the total amount of money from pennies is:
\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs he can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ \frac{345}{5} = 69 \]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To solve this, let's count the legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: Each dog has 4 legs. With 5 dogs, that's 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
- Cats: Each cat has 4 legs. With 2 cats, that's 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
- Birds: Each bird has 2 legs. With 10 birds, that's 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add them all up:
20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48 legs in total.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"First, we need to find out what 50% of the 8-pound weight is. To do this, we multiply 8 by 0.50:

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \]

So, 50% of 8 pounds is 4 pounds. Now, we add this to the original 8-pound weight to find out what the new weight is before it's made lighter:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Jamaal finds the 12-pound weight too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. To find this weight, we subtract 2 from 12:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem year by year.

**Year 1:**
- Initial games: 5
- Games bought: 1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games
- Total games after Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games: 17 (from Year 1)
- Games bought: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Total games after Year 2: 17 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 41 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games: 41 (from Year 2)
- Games bought: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5 games
- Total games after Year 3: 41 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 94 games

So, after 3 years, Steve has 94 games."
"To find the rate of the plane, we divide the distance it travels by the time it takes. So, the rate is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we divide the additional distance by the rate:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find the amount he makes in one hour:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly production} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we know Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly production} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total production in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total production in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total production of Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds."
"On Tuesday, Howard spends $8 * 2 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spends $16 * 4 = $64.
In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.
If he originally had $100, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
So, for one hour, he earned 15 * $0.50 = $7.50.
For four hours, he earned 4 * $7.50 = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, for one hour, he earned 10 * $0.60 = $6.
For two hours, he earned 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods:
$30 (first four hours) + $12 (next two hours) = $42.

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"First, let's calculate how many times the tires rotate in a month. If the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, then for 400 miles the tires rotate:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 200 \times 725 \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 145,000 \]

Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} \]

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} \]

\[ \text{Years per tire} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years."
"First, we need to find out how many times Jackie can use the shampoo with 1 pump per wash. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump will give half the number of washes. So, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washes.

The bottle costs $24.00, and we need to find out how much each pump costs. Since 2 pumps cost $24.00, 1 pump will cost $24.00 / 2 = $12.00.

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100. So, $12.00 is 12 * 100 = 1200 cents.

Therefore, each pump costs 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25 and there's a 30% off sale.

Discount on shirt = 30% of $25 = 0.30 * $25 = $7.50

So, the shirt will cost Joe $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 after the discount.

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there's a 30% off sale.

Discount on shorts = 30% of $35 = 0.30 * $35 = $10.50

So, the shorts will cost Joe $35 - $10.50 = $24.50 after the discount.

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit.

Total cost of outfit = $17.50 + $24.50 = $42

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from the $50 he has.

Money left = $50 - $42 = $8

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. He wants to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:

\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 65760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John's research took. He initially planned for 5 months but it ended up taking 10 times that long. So, the total time is:
\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

The first 5 months cost $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month increased by 50%. So, the funding per month for the last 45 months is:
\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the last 45 months:
\[ 45 \text{ months} \times 150,000 \text{ dollars per month} = 6,750,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the initial funding to the cost of the last 45 months gives us the total cost of the research:
\[ 100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of John's research is:
\[ \boxed{6850000} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the meat consumption for each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

Now, let's add up the meat consumption:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total meat consumed = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of posts in March. March has 31 days.

If each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times a day, then the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
\[ 93000 \]"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total gallons of water Gary uses for laundry in a week.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water Gary uses for laundry in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used for laundry in a year.

Step 1: Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water.
So, in a week, Gary uses \(2 \times 20 = 40\) gallons of water for laundry.

Step 2: There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year, Gary uses \(40 \times 52 = 2080\) gallons of water for laundry.

Step 3: A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for 2080 gallons is \(2080 \times 0.15 = 312\) dollars.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Scarlett bought:

- The aquarium cost $10.00.
- The 2 bags of rocks cost $2.50 each, so 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
- The 3 pieces of coral cost $2.00 each, so 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- The 20 fish cost $0.50 each, so 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
- The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

Total cost = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00."
"To find out how tall Jane's beanstalk was after 3 weeks, let's add up the growth week by week.

- After the first week, it was 3 inches tall.
- After the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.
- In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, so he sells:
15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

The bull weighs 750kg, so it will take:
750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

So, the final numerical answer is 5 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats each.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left.

Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats

To find out how many seats were occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators and the parents from the remaining seats.

Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents) = 18 seats

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Next, since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 of these street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their respective maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To find out the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of sessions John attended:**
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.
   - So, each week he attended \(2 \times 2 = 4\) sessions.
   - Over 6 weeks, he attended \(6 \times 4 = 24\) sessions.

2. **Calculate the total cost per session:**
   - Each hour of therapy costs $125.
   - Each session is 2 hours long.
   - Therefore, the cost per session is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all sessions:**
   - John attended 24 sessions.
   - The cost per session is $250.
   - So, the total cost is \(24 \times 250 = 6000\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 6000."
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece every 2 hours and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school hours as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school, we get:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial pack of gum:

\[ \text{Gum left after chewing} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed:

\[ \text{Gum given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we subtract the pieces given to his sister from the remaining gum:

\[ \text{Gum left after giving to sister} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find out the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply these numbers:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

So, there are 200 flowers in total. Now, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find this number, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times 0.8 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is 160."
"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s). Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the kb/s by 1000 to get Mb/s.

Ashley's speed in Mb/s is:
\[ \frac{20 \, \text{kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.

Ashley's speed in Mb/h is:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, it would be:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the last four days (Tuesday through Friday), it pulled 4 fewer cars each day than the first three days. So it pulled:
10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars/day

For the last four days, it would be:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, to find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the last four days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is 54."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Adam's height in feet = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.3333 feet

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

So, Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.3333 feet = 0.6667 feet more to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Since Adam grows 2 inches (which is 2/12 feet) every year, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow 0.6667 feet.

Years needed = 0.6667 feet / (2/12 feet/year) = 0.6667 * 12/2 = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost the company paid is:
30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

Now, let's find out the profit James made:
Total revenue from selling the cars - Cost the company paid = Profit
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, the final numerical answer is $17,500."
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, and a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel, so:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.
In total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.
The final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the gap between him and Bob.

Bob is 75 miles ahead and driving at 55 mph.
Tom is driving at 70 mph.

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to first determine the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

The total cost for 10 classes is $60. So, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the condition given. Therefore, Manny can miss all 10 classes before they don't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers a day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of customers they process in a day together:

\[ 50 \text{ (Jewel's customers)} + 100 \text{ (Julie's customers)} = 150 \text{ customers a day} \]

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

\[ 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]"
"First, let's find out how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 * 4
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

Now, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
$7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $13,500

The base price of the truck is $30,000. So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:
$30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (extra features) = $43,500

The final numerical answer is $43,500."
"To calculate how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to first determine his new monthly salary after the raise and bonus, and then multiply that by 12 months.

1. **Calculate the raise amount:**
   - Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
   - The raise is 5% of $20000.
   - Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

2. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - New monthly salary = Original salary + Raise amount = $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

3. **Calculate the bonus amount:**
   - The bonus is half a month's salary.
   - Bonus amount = Half of $21000 = $21000 / 2 = $10500.

4. **Calculate the total monthly income:**
   - Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus amount = $21000 + $10500 = $31500.

5. **Calculate the annual income:**
   - Annual income = Total monthly income * 12 months = $31500 * 12 = $378000.

So, Tim will make $378000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- So, the cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- So, the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- So, the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of suits: $7500
- Cost of dress pants: $1500
- Cost of dress shirts: $1800
- Total cost: \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

So, the total cost for everything is 10800 dollars."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of articles each website publishes in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Similarly, for 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ 840 \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Steve's family members.

Steve is 60 years old.

His wife is 4 years older than him, so:
\[ 60 + 4 = 64 \]
So, Steve's wife is 64 years old.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so:
\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]
So, Steve's son is 32 years old.

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so if we let the age of their son's husband be \( x \), then:
\[ x - 3 \]
Since we don't have the exact age of their son's husband, we can't determine the exact age of their son's wife without more information. However, the question only asks for the age of Steve's son's wife, and we can infer that the age of their son's wife is 3 years younger than the age of their son, which is 32.

So, the age of Steve's son's wife is:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour is in one bag.

If one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, then the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find out how much flour is in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so she biked a total of 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.
Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so he biked a total of 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.
Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 54 + 25 = 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate how fast Bill can dig through clay. Since he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, he can dig half that speed through clay, which is 2 feet/hour.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

For the soil:
- He needs to dig 24 feet.
- He digs at a rate of 4 feet/hour.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

For the clay:
- He needs to dig 8 feet.
- He digs at a rate of 2 feet/hour.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, let's add the time for both soil and clay to get the total time:
- Total time = 6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 10 hours."
"To figure out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will be getting cupcakes. This includes Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. So, we add these numbers together:

1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Since each person will get 2 cupcakes, we multiply the number of people by 2:

27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many likes the photo had three weeks after Fishio posted it. We know that after one week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we calculate the likes after three weeks as follows:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that three weeks after posting, the photo had 140,000 likes. Now, if she received 20000 more new likes recently, we add these to the 140,000 likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes on the photo now is:

\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice that amount because they were half the total amount earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - So, the total sales for the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales for the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales for the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - The total sales for the two months were the sum of the sales from the first and second months.
   - So, the total sales for the two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final numerical answer is $2100."
"First, let's break down the time James hires the carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, he pays for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. The cost for each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the second hour is $30 and for the third hour is also $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

So, James paid $75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between what her bank account should have been at the end of the week and what it actually is.

Her bank account should have been $300 (her weekly wage) + $200 (initial amount) = $500 at the end of the week.

But it actually has $420.

So, the amount withheld is $500 - $420 = $80.

The final numerical answer is $80."
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs for her guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we calculate:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper, which means she has written:

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) pages.

\( 15 - 5 = 10 \) pages.

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. If the book is 200 pages long, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. To find out how many days before the deadline he will finish, we subtract the number of days he will take to read the book from the total deadline days.

\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total deadline days} - \text{Number of days to finish} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel. The cost for renting the hanger is $5000 a month. The cost for fuel is twice that, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month.

So, the total monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel is $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

For the first year, there are 12 months. So, the total cost for renting the hanger and fuel for the first year is $15000 * 12 = $180000.

The plane itself cost $150,000.

Therefore, the total cost for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the cost of renting and fueling for the first year, which is $150000 + $180000 = $330000.

So, the final numerical answer is $330000."
"First, let's determine the cooking time for each item:

- It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
- It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so:
  \[
  \text{Cooking time for pork} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
  \[
  30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
  \[
  \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the almonds and walnuts in each mixture.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this, let's use the information given:

- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

From the information given:
1. The total number of legs is 70.
2. The total number of heads is 20.

We can set up the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total heads)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Now, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is 15."

- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- A bottle of soda: $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:

$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (cost of other items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's do the math:
600 - 198 = 402
402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 193."
"First, let's calculate the total class time John spends. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the weekly class time is:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. Since 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia has $120
- Kassidy has $90
- Rayna has $150

Next, we add up all their money to find the total:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"The game is 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 minutes. Since the last quarter was extended for 5 minutes, we add that to the total time. So the entire game lasted 48 + 5 = 53 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many employees are management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 10 \times \frac{30}{100} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, we multiply this by 16 to find out the total for 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 8.25 * 16

Let's calculate that:
8.25 * 16 = 132 tablespoons

So, the final numerical answer is 132 tablespoons."
"First, we need to find the total amount of candy they have together. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, we add these amounts together:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy in total.

Now, they want to share this candy equally among the three of them. To find out how much candy each person will get, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Now, let's add these two amounts to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many good days are left in the month, we need to subtract the days that are not good from the total number of days.

Christina had twelve good days in total. Out of the first eight days, eight were good. In the second eight days, eight were bad. So, the good days from the first and second eight days are:

8 (first eight days) + 0 (second eight days) = 8 good days

The next three days are given as good, neutral, and good. So, we add these to the good days:

8 (already counted) + 1 (next good day) + 1 (next good day) = 10 good days

Since there are thirty days in the month, and we know there are twelve good days in total, we can find out how many good days are left by subtracting the total good days from the total days:

30 (total days) - 12 (total good days) = 18 days

So, the number of good days left in the month is 18."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say Sally has \( S \) books. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \]

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

If the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, then the number of days required to grow 360 inches is 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

So, the final answer is 12 days."
"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He has 4 dogs and 4 toys, so each dog has one toy. Now, there are 8 more dogs, so he needs 8 more toys. That makes a total of 4 (current toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he had 4 dogs when he left, twice as many more dogs means 4 * 2 = 8 more dogs. So, he needs to buy toys for these 8 additional dogs, making the total 12 (current toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 20 toys.

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he can remove the 3 toys he had bought for those dogs from the total. So, 20 (total toys) - 3 (toys for the dogs that left) = 17 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount:

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Now, let's find out how much Skyler invested. Skyler's investment is the rest of the money after Dylan and Frances have invested:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment was $240."

"To find out how many hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes, we first need to understand the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato and then use that to find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make.

First, let's find out how many hash browns one potato makes:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the total number of hash browns:
\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

Now, let's find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator.

Exceeding load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can calculate Max's cookies as follows:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Now, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, we can find out how many cookies Summer has:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

To find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 302 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ 302 \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in each mode.

In turtle mode, it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since he mowed half of the lawn in turtle mode, it would take him 30 minutes (half of 1 hour).

In rabbit mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn. Since he mowed the other half of the lawn in rabbit mode, it would take him 20 minutes (half of 40 minutes).

Now, we add the time spent in both modes to find the total time:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation. Since \( T = Tr + 7 \), we can replace \( T \) in the second equation with \( Tr + 7 \):

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying this equation:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins (\( T \)) using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old."

"First, let's find out how much Manolo spent on the lollipops and candies.

He bought five lollipops at $0.40 each, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

He also bought four candies that cost $3.20 in total.

Now, we need to find the cost of one candy. Since four candies cost $3.20, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Adding the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together gives:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, we calculate Neil's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's savings per month} = 20 + \left(20 \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins each of them has after ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings after ten years would be:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings after ten years would be:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives us the combined savings of Rong and Neil after ten years:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:

- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so it's $0.5 * 2 = $1.
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so it's $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit:

- The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

"First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that when Gissela, Gordy, and Gary bring their trucks together, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can haul. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as G.

The total capacity of all three trucks is the sum of their individual capacities:

Total capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity + Gary's truck capacity
11,600 pounds = 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds + G

Now, let's solve for G:

11,600 pounds = 8,800 pounds + G
G = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds
G = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

Cat's speed = 15 feet/second
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time.

Turtle's distance = Turtle's speed * Time = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To solve this, we need to find out how much money the firefighters have to raise per hour and then determine how many more hours they need to raise the rest of the money.

They have a goal of $6300 and have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:
\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

If they raise an equal amount of money every hour, we need to find out how much they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so:
\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]
So, they raise $700 per hour.

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:
\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise for 6 more hours to reach their goal. Adding the initial 3 hours to the 6 hours, the total number of hours they need to raise money is:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"First, let's find out what percentage of the Colorado River's water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City. Since Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the industrial usage as follows:

\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

So, 32% of the Colorado River's total water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

To find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:

\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to calculate the cost for one week and then double it.

Alex charges $12 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the cost for one week is:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 84 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 2 weeks, the cost would be:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
168"
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes per hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, to find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of croissants + Cost of cinnamon rolls + Cost of mini quiches + Cost of blueberry muffins
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00
Total cost = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost - Discount amount
Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00
Final bill = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with her $6.00.

Let's calculate:
- For 3 scoops, she pays for 2 scoops.
- So, for every $3.00, she gets 3 scoops.

Now, let's see how many sets of $3.00 she can make with $6.00:
- $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

So, with 2 sets, she can get:
- 2 sets * 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream."
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, and Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. So, Ginger eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, Amy eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how much candy Ginger and Amy have left after two weeks. Initially, both had 100 pieces of candy.

After two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first calculate the area of the bathroom he wants to cover, which is two thirds of 36 sq ft.

\[ \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to cover by the number of tiles per square foot.

\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 576."
"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries. He had to pay a flat fee of $20 plus $1.5 for each pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for picking the blueberries is:

\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:

\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they paid for 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese has 120 calories. So, the total calories from cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories. So, the total calories from ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[ 770 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50 and you bought 6 pencils, the total cost for pencils is:
\[ 0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. Since each eraser costs $0.25 and you bought 8 erasers, the total cost for erasers is:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the items by adding the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for all the items. To find out how much change you would get, subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find out how many of those who receive interviews get a job offer. Since 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews get a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people get a job offer.

Now, we need to find out how many of those who get a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the 6 people who get a job offer accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Goldy gave a total of 3 + 4 = 7 sacks of rice to her cousin and brother.

"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes when she is dancing with both hands at her sides.

She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 5 minutes, the total number of taps when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 550 \times 5 = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she makes when she raises her arms.

When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[ 2750 + 800 = 3550 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ 3550 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets it would be \(3 \times 25 = 75\).

So, the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is:
\[120 + 75 = 195\]

Now, let's compare this to the damage the pothole would do to his car, which is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is:
\[450 - 195 = 255\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[255\]"

23 baby chairs - 13 chairs = 10 chairs

Now, let's add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends), the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated by adding the times and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches can be converted as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashes from the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
So, the number of windows she smashes from the students' cars is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashes from the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
So, the number of windows she smashes from the teachers' cars is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (from students) + 48 (from teachers) = 112 windows.

So, the final numerical answer is 112."
"To solve this, we first need to find the total number of spools Candy has. We do this by adding up all the spools:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools + 40 light green spools + 50 dark green spools = 150 spools in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these are blue. Since we have both light blue and dark blue spools, we add those together:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 60 blue spools.

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means the number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people had voted by 16:00. To find out how many people had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining people after midday:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids, so:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

Each adult will eat 1 smore and there are 6 adults, so:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding the smores for kids and adults:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Now, we know that each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. To find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total age = 87

So, the final numerical answer is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

Each person, including Greg, gets $5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, we can calculate the total weight of these books as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science books)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English books)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history book)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B got. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, so:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, to find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Total votes} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for candidate A} - \text{Votes for candidate B} \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

Boris's new apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new apples = 90

And Beck will have:

Beck's new apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new number of apples from Boris's new number of apples:

Fewer apples = Boris's new apples - Beck's new apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

For the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

For the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

For the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 2 ounces."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has. So Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest like to play video games or play music

We are also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students is 50. The number of students who like to bake, play basketball, or play music is:

\[ 10 \text{ (bake)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} + 10 \text{ (music)} = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

25"
"Jeremy scared away 12 birds * 1/3 = 4 birds.
So, the number of birds that remained in the backyard is 12 - 4 = 8 birds.
Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds, making the total number of birds 8 + 20 = 28 birds.
The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the total number of students in the two classes is 80.
2. Since each class has the same amount of students, each class has \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) students.
3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. So, 60% of the students are boys because \( 100\% - 40\% = 60\% \).
4. To find out how many boys are in each class, we calculate 60% of 40 students. 

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 \times \frac{60}{100} = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara initially had 2 slices and added 3 more, making it 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
She then tripled the number of slices, so 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices left.
Then her friend stole 5 slices, so 13 - 5 = 8 slices remained.
The final number of cake slices on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to add up all the animals she has to groom this week.

She has:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives us:
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Since she has 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many she will groom each day.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the cards Mark got. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $26 each is: 2 * $26 = $52
- The cost for 2 children at $12 each is: 2 * $12 = $24
- The total cost for the first amusement park is: $52 + $24 = $76

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $14 each is: 2 * $14 = $28
- The cost for 2 children at $10 each is: 2 * $10 = $20
- The total cost for the second amusement park is: $28 + $20 = $48

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's calculate how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money he spends a day with his new vendor. The new vendor sells them for $0.4 each, so the daily cost is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:

\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily savings by 7:

\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$350."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for Cal's marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles together:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 336 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many students are in each group when there are 6 groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \text{Students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups we can form with 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find out how many groups we can form:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

The question asks how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, we need to form 6 more groups to reach 12 groups.

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

The final numerical answer is:

6"
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week:
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - So, in one week, Candy rents \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week:
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each day in the weekend.
   - So, in one week, Candy rents \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:
   - Total chairs rented in one week = Chairs rented during weekdays + Chairs rented during weekends
   - Total chairs rented in one week = \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one month (4 weeks):
   - Total chairs rented in one month = Total chairs rented in one week \(\times 4\)
   - Total chairs rented in one month = \(500 \times 4 = 2000\) chairs.

5. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two months:
   - Total chairs rented in two months = Total chairs rented in one month \(\times 2\)
   - Total chairs rented in two months = \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

So, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Gunther had after Arnold stole half of them the first time.

Gunther initially had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so:
\[ \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after adding 25} = 24 + 25 = 49 \]

Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas left after Arnold stole 12} = 49 - 12 = 37 \]

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after adding 6} = 37 + 6 = 43 \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total yearly cost of the electricity bill.

The monthly cost is $100, so the yearly cost is:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \]

Since there are 4 roommates and they divide the cost equally, each roommate will pay:
\[ 1200 \div 4 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's calculate how many large stickers she has left after trading 20 for large buttons:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's add up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- From trading small stickers for large buttons: 27 small buttons
- From trading large stickers for large buttons: 20 large buttons
- From trading large stickers for small buttons: 60 small buttons

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we need to convert the 20 large buttons into small buttons:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of small buttons Lorraine has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the total number of buttons (both large and small) Lorraine has is:

\[ \frac{147}{3} = 49 \text{ large buttons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 49 \]"
"Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches. So, in one week Joey played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so we can denote the number of votes in favor as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we calculate the number of votes in favor as:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(18 / 2 = 9\) students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total shirts ordered = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount amount is $7.

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

Therefore, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"To find out how many hours the 20 playlists last in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs in all playlists.
2. Calculate the total time in hours for all the songs.

First, we know that each playlist has 300 songs and there are 20 playlists. So, the total number of songs is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. So, the total time in hours for all the songs is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the 20 playlists last is:
\[ 60000 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people is:

\( 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \)

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we subtract the 10 people who think horse #2 will win from the total of 50 people to find out how many people are left:

\( 50 - 10 = 40 \)

Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win:

\( 40 \times \frac{60}{100} = 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \)

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people left:

\( 40 - 24 = 16 \)

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is three times the number of girls, because 6 is one third of the total Pomeranians. So, we can calculate the total number of Pomeranians as follows:

\[ \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the equation where the total number of puppies is three times the number of Pomeranians. This is because 18 (the number of Pomeranians) is two thirds of the total number of puppies. So, we can calculate the total number of puppies as follows:

\[ \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's find out how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is $90 / 2 = $45.

Jayden originally had $70, so after his sister gives him $45, Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera.

So, $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \).
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is the same as the second house, so the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

"If George has 200 bananas and 45% more pears than bananas, we first need to calculate how many pears he has.

45% of 200 bananas is calculated as:
\[ 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than the 200 bananas he has. Therefore, the total number of pears is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is 490."
"First, we need to find out how much money Marissa spent on the ball. She had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so we subtract:

$80 - $20 = $60

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges, and each kilogram costs $3. So, for 1 liter, the cost would be 5 * $3 = $15.

To make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times the amount of oranges, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

So, the final answer is $60."
"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that. So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books after the initial hour. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read. So, 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600 books.

The final numerical answer is 600."
"First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns for teaching classes on Monday and Wednesday.

For Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for Monday, she earns 4 * 5 * 15 = 4 * 75 = $300.

For Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns 2 * 2 * 15 = 2 * 30 = $60.

Now, let's add the additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she taught more than 3 classes on both days, she gets an additional $5 for each day.

For Monday, she gets an additional $5.
For Wednesday, she gets an additional $5.

So, the total additional earnings for both days are 5 + 5 = $10.

Now, let's add the earnings from teaching and the additional earnings:
- Total earnings from teaching = $300 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $360.
- Total additional earnings = $10.

So, the total amount Tanya earned for these two days of teaching is $360 + $10 = $370.

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

For vanilla scents:
They have 4 vanilla scents and sold 5 of each.
So, total vanilla scents sold = 5.

For fruity scents:
They have 8 fruity scents and sold 2 of each.
So, total fruity scents sold = 2.

Now, we find the difference:
Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 5 - 2
Difference = 3

So, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. So, the amount of money he needs to make from selling the corn is:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

He has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn:
\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:

7 hours on Saturday + 5 hours on Sunday = 12 hours total.

She spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time after reading is:

12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time after reading. So, the time spent on video games is:

1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on soccer. The total time spent on soccer, video games, and reading is 12 hours. We already know she spent 3 hours reading and 3 hours on video games, so the time spent on soccer is:

12 hours - 3 hours (reading) - 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. He gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon, so:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, let's find out how many pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Brandon:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after giving to Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. So, let's calculate how many pencils that is:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Now, let's find out how many pencils Anthony kept. We subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils after giving some to Brandon:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Jack spends traveling to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance is 150 miles and he drives at 75 mph. The time taken to travel one way is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives both to and from the museum, the total travel time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours (to)} + 2 \text{ hours (back)} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time he is gone from home is:

\[ 4 \text{ hours (travel)} + 6 \text{ hours (at the museum)} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in series, so that's \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) movies.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so that's \( 400 \times \frac{40}{100} = 160 \) older movies.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so for 200 series movies, the cost is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so for 160 older movies, the cost is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining 240 movies is $10 each, so for 240 normal movies, the cost is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is $4400."
"To calculate how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each fruit by its price per pound and then add all the amounts together.

For peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
For plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
For apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ mph} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50 \text{ mph}}{2} - 5 \text{ mph} = 25 \text{ mph} - 5 \text{ mph} = 20 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the points for each player based on the information given.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

For enemies:
- Emma gets 10 points per enemy.
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so if Emma jumps on x enemies, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
- Emma's points from enemies = 10x
- Ava's points from enemies = 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

For berries:
- Emma gets 5 points per berry.
- Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so if Ava collects y berries, Emma collects y - 3 berries.
- Emma's points from berries = 5(y - 3)
- Ava's points from berries = 5y

For the timer:
- Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster, so she gets 30 * 4 = 120 points less.
- Emma's points from the timer = 30 * 4 = 120
- Ava's points from the timer = 30 * (4 + 4) = 30 * 8 = 240

Now, let's calculate the difference in their scores:
Ava's total score = 10x + 80 + 5y
Emma's total score = 10x + 5(y - 3) + 120

The difference in their scores is:
Ava's score - Emma's score = (10x + 80 + 5y) - (10x + 5y - 15 + 120)
= 10x + 80 + 5y - 10x - 5y + 15 - 120
= 80 + 15 - 120
= 95 - 120
= -25

So, Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's score. The difference between their scores is -25 points."
"First, let's find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each add up to:
30 dollars + 30 dollars = 60 dollars

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost for the other two pizzas is:
64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 dollars ÷ 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times a week for the first 5 days.
On the other two days, they ride twice as many times as usual, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 times a day for those two days.
For the two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.
Adding the usual days and the special days together, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.
The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's understand the situation. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then added 17 fish from the pet store, and after adding these, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). So, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step. From the first equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O = 17 - W \) into the second equation:
\[ 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W) \]
\[ 20 - W = 8 + 2W \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2W + W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find out how many orange fish he bought, we use the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, if Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish, the total number of fish added is 17. After adding these fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \). Since 16 is indeed twice 8, our solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. If the one-way distance is 5 miles, then the round trip (home to office and back) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. So, in a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so for 50 miles, he would need 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas he consumes in a week. If the price of gas is $3/gallon, then for 5 gallons, the cost would be 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week.

So, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters, the total amount in quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties, the total amount in twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount spent for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 155 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Ricardo can get. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \times 5 = 110 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants:
\[ 110 + 32 = 142 \]

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales are 40 TVs.

First, let's calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Smart TVs} + \text{Analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300.
The school is covering half of the cost, so the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50, so the amount he still needs is $300 - $150 - $50 = $100.

So, the final numerical answer is 100."
"First, we need to find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we need to find out how much it needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed by the degrees each log provides:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, there were 10 groups formed.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, we calculate 3/5 of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups brought back seashells. Since each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by 2 to find the total number of seashells:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells they brought is 12."
"Starting with 172 people, after 47 get off, there are 172 - 47 = 125 people left. Then, 13 more people get on, making the total 125 + 13 = 138 people. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train.

He finds 10 bottle caps a day, so in a 30 day month, he would find:
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the total money he makes is:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

So, the final numerical answer is $75."
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for regular hours.

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to determine her special hourly rate for the additional hours. She worked 11 hours in total, so the additional hours are:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, we calculate the special hourly rate:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Special pay} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her special pay to find her total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \$250 for her work on last Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions, there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. There are 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply that by the salary per month.

Starting with the initial number of employees:
- Initial employees = 200

The company hires 20 new employees every month. So after one month:
- Employees = 200 + 20 = 220

After two months:
- Employees = 220 + 20 = 240

After three months:
- Employees = 240 + 20 = 260

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount paid after three months is:
- Total amount = 260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

The final numerical answer is $1,040,000."

"First, let's calculate Billy's starting salary and then his salary after the raises.

Billy's initial pay rate was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.00 per hour.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for 20 hours at each of these rates:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours * $10.00/hour) = $200.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $10.50/hour) = $210.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $11.00/hour) = $220.00

So, Billy's total earnings for 6 months are $200.00 + $210.00 + $220.00 = $630.00.

Now, let's calculate Sally's starting salary. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10.00 per hour. So, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour:
- Sally's total earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $630.00 - $210.00 = $420.00.

So, Billy will earn $420.00 more than Sally."

"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the students will plant:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the teachers will plant:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's denote the number of stuffed goats she wants to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, let's isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."

"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.

For fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.

For fifth graders:
The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so it's \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school. The school has 500 third graders, 100 fourth graders, and 400 fifth graders, making a total of \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \) students.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The overall pass rate is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's calculate how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has two bags, and each bag contains 72 chips.

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Now, we know that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per square inch.

Square inches Milo can make = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic.

Length of the mosaic = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

So, the final numerical answer is 4 inches."

"To solve this, let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year.

- At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

So, the additional students are 320 - 10 = 310.

The final numerical answer is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed to make $105.

Since each branch costs $.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made $105 in a week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks initially:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals she picks:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, she drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, so she loses 5 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, so she loses 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, so she loses 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, so she loses 7 petals.

The total number of petals she loses is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the lost petals from the total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 32 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 32 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

Since John and DeSean are making the S'mores together, we can divide the remaining marshmallows equally between them. So, each kid can have:
32 ÷ 2 = 16 S'mores.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's determine how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes each with one quarter.
His one friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together:
Jack plays for 20 minutes.
His two worse friends play for 10 minutes each, so together they play for 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.
His better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together:
20 (Jack) + 20 (worse friends) + 30 (better friend) = 70 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many quarters they need:
They play for 240 minutes in total, and each quarter gets them 20 minutes.
So, they need 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 12."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Salt (S) = Sugar (S)
2. Oil (O) = 2 * Salt (O = 2S)
3. Fragrance (F) = Citrus Zest (F = Z)
4. Salt (S) = Citrus Zest (S = Z)
5. Total mixture = 10 ounces

From the information, we know that Salt (S) = Citrus Zest (Z) and Oil (O) = 2 * Salt (S). Also, since Salt (S) = Citrus Zest (Z), we can say Oil (O) = 2 * Citrus Zest (O = 2Z).

Since Salt (S) = Citrus Zest (Z), and Oil (O) = 2 * Salt (O = 2S), we can substitute Salt (S) for Citrus Zest (Z) in the Oil equation, making Oil (O) = 2 * Citrus Zest (O = 2Z).

Now, let's add up all the parts:
- Salt (S) + Citrus Zest (Z) + Oil (O) + Fragrance (F) + Sugar (S) = 10 ounces
- S + S + O + F + S = 10 ounces
- 3S + O + F = 10 ounces

Since Oil (O) = 2 * Citrus Zest (O = 2Z) and Citrus Zest (Z) = Salt (S), we can say Oil (O) = 2 * Salt (O = 2S).

Now, let's substitute the values:
- 3S + 2S + S = 10 ounces
- 6S = 10 ounces

To find the amount of Salt (S), we divide both sides by 6:
- S = 10 / 6 ounces
- S = 5 / 3 ounces

Now, to find the amount of Oil (O):
- O = 2S
- O = 2 * (5 / 3)
- O = 10 / 3 ounces

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 10/3 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so the total cost for the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the total cost for the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total."
"Paul has a total of 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

He needs 63 cupcakes for the party.

So, the number of additional cupcakes Paul should buy is 63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes."
"If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, then Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40, so he sells 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

After selling and giving away cars, Joe remains with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine how much money the students raised in total. The total money raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."
"First, let's calculate the time Sandy spent walking each day in hours.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.

On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, she walked for \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both days to find the total time in hours.

Total time in hours = Time on first day + Time on second day
Total time in hours = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time in hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Total time in minutes = Total time in hours * 60
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 720 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars before the lunch break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate how much John makes in one day:
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - So, the total payment for one cycle is \(5 \times 1.20 = 6.00\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total payment for one day is \(30 \times 6.00 = 180.00\) dollars.

2. Now, calculate how much John makes in a week:
   - John works 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total payment for a week is \(7 \times 180.00 = 1260.00\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 1260.00."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Smendrick has, we multiply PJ's cards by 3:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And to find out how many cards Becca has, we add 12 to Smendrick's cards:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
153"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
Altogether, Cindy had 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.
The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose. This is the cost of the book plus the shipping cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 * $30 = $60
Cost of the bag: $20

Total cost of the items: $60 + $20 = $80

Now, let's find out how much money Mulan has left after buying the items.

Money left: Total money after receiving from her father - Total cost of the items
Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, so for the fourth week:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production for the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week. She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to add the time she spends writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the time she spends doing her makeup. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup each week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for Angela's initial items:

- She needs 6 mirrors, and the cost for 4 mirrors is $129.00, so the cost for 1 mirror is $129.00 / 4 = $32.25. Therefore, the cost for 6 mirrors is $32.25 * 6 = $193.50.
- She needs 2 chandeliers, and the cost for 1 chandelier is $129.00, so the cost for 1 chandelier is $129.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 chandeliers is $129.00 * 2 = $258.00.
- She needs 20 pictures, and the cost for 10 pictures is $129.00, so the cost for 1 picture is $129.00 / 10 = $12.90. Therefore, the cost for 20 pictures is $12.90 * 20 = $258.00.

Now, let's add up the cost for the initial items:
$193.50 (mirrors) + $258.00 (chandeliers) + $258.00 (pictures) = $609.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost for additional items:
- She needs 2 more mirrors, which will cost $15.00 per mirror, so the cost for 2 mirrors is $15.00 * 2 = $30.00.
- She needs 4 more shelves, and the cost for 1 shelf is $129.00 / 4 = $32.25, so the cost for 1 shelf is $32.25. Therefore, the cost for 4 shelves is $32.25 * 4 = $129.00.
- She needs 10 more pictures, and the cost for 1 picture is $12.90, so the cost for 1 picture is $12.90. Therefore, the cost for 10 pictures is $12.90 * 10 = $129.00.

Now, let's add up the cost for the additional items:
$30.00 (mirrors) + $129.00 (shelves) + $129.00 (pictures) = $288.00.

Finally, let's add the cost for the initial items and the additional items:
$609.50 (initial items) + $288.00 (additional items) = $897.50.

So, the total cost for Angela will be $897.50."
"First, let's find out how much money Eva has saved. According to the question, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The question states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]

So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The question tells us that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he covers 8 * 4 = 32 miles. Then he travels for another 6 hours, covering 8 * 6 = 48 miles. In total, he has traveled 32 + 48 = 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

To find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway, we need to consider the speed relationship between the kangaroos and the turtles.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the total ""kangaroo-hours"" needed to cross the highway. This is simply the number of kangaroos multiplied by the time they take:
\[ 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours} \]

This means that 54 ""kangaroo-hours"" are needed to cross the highway. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take twice as long for a turtle to cover the same distance. Therefore, to cover 54 ""kangaroo-hours"" worth of distance, it will take:
\[ 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours} \times 2 = 108 \text{ turtle-hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover 108 ""turtle-hours"" of distance. Since the total distance is the same, we divide the total ""turtle-hours"" by the number of turtles:
\[ \frac{108 \text{ turtle-hours}}{4 \text{ turtles}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 27 hours for 4 turtles to cross the highway."

Together, they made 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.
The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after trading in the old one. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in reduces the price by $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 now. We know that Erika has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Let's add these amounts to her current savings in her purse:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

If we let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse, then the total amount of money she has now is:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer gets from his 3 cows a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we first determine the additional amount of milk needed:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce this additional 10 liters of milk. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we divide the additional milk needed by the milk produced by one cow:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is left and then subtract that from the full length of the glue stick.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   - 1/6 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (1/6) = 2 millimeters used, so 12 - 2 = 10 millimeters not used.

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   - 2/3 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (2/3) = 8 millimeters used, so 12 - 8 = 4 millimeters not used.

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   - 1/2 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters used, so 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters not used.

Now, we add up the unused lengths:
- 10 millimeters + 4 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 20 millimeters.

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

We know:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know there are 20 students in total. So, we subtract the number of students who are only good at math and the number of students who perform well in English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are only good at math to the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students who are good at math is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. This is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

Next, we need to add the intermission time to the total time. The intermission is 10 minutes.

So, the total time for one group including the intermission is 10 minutes (performance) + 10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many groups can perform in a 2-hour concert. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group.

So, the number of groups that can perform is 120 minutes / 20 minutes per group = 6 groups.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original amount.

The original amount (principal) is $300.
The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 675 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

So, the total amount after 3 years will be the original amount plus the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"First, let's determine how many white shirts have collars and how many do not.

- Total white shirts = 40
- White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars = 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's find out how many floral shirts have no buttons.

- Total floral shirts = 50
- Floral shirts with buttons = 20
- Floral shirts without buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons = 30
- White shirts without collars = 20

To find the difference:

- Difference = Floral shirts without buttons - White shirts without collars
- Difference = 30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars. The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all the eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Now that we know the farmer needs 30 trays to hold all the eggs, we can calculate the total earnings. If each tray is sold for $2.5, then:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays."
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.
In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y together:
\(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount he spends on shoes by the total number of pairs he buys.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you're buying 3 baskets, the total cost for green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. So, the effective cost per basket of red food is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you're buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
123"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rooms are half of 90 rooms.
2. Determine the total time in minutes to clean those rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.

Step 2: It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, for 45 rooms, the total time in minutes is:
\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, they build 12 homes.

In the second year, they build three times the first year, which is 12 * 3 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total from the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. So, in the third year, they will build 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Over the next three years, the town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Your age = \( x \)
- Your brother's age = \( x + 3 \)
- Your sister's age = \( x - 2 \)

According to the problem, the sum of your ages, your brother's age, and your sister's age is 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x + 1 = 87 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 86 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{86}{3} \approx 28.67 \]

Since we are dealing with whole ages, and the problem implies a whole number solution, let's check if 28 or 29 could be the correct age. If \( x = 28 \):
- Your age = 28
- Your brother's age = 28 + 3 = 31
- Your sister's age = 28 - 2 = 26

Adding these ages together:
\[ 28 + 31 + 26 = 85 \]

This is not 87, so let's try \( x = 29 \):
- Your age = 29
- Your brother's age = 29 + 3 = 32
- Your sister's age = 29 - 2 = 27

Adding these ages together:
\[ 29 + 32 + 27 = 88 \]

This is not 87 either, but since 28.67 is closer to 29, and the closest whole number that fits the sum of 87 is 29, we can conclude that you are 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
29"
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

1. On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.
3. On the third day, the volume increases by 6000 gallons from the second day's amount, so it becomes 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Starting with 10 infected people:
- On the first day, each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Adding these to the initial 10, we have 10 + 60 = 70 infected people.
- On the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so that's 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Adding these to the 70, we have 70 + 420 = 490 infected people.
- On the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so that's 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections. Adding these to the 490, we have 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people.

So, after three days, 3430 people are infected."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Now, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

10% of $800 = 0.10 * $800 = $80

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela:

$800 - $80 = $720

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received altogether, we add their tips together:

$800 (Rafaela's tips) + $720 (Julieta's tips) = $1520

So, the total amount of money they received as tips altogether is $1520."
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave her three daughters a total of 2 oranges each, which is 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her son got 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is 12 - 9 = 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 12 badges in a year because 12 months in a year.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge every month. In a year, Amber earns 6 badges because 12 months in a year divided by 2 equals 6.

Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 36 badges in a year because 12 times 3 equals 36.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices she can get from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

So, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.

The final numerical answer is 110."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given to students is:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the leftover burritos:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 * 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out how many yellow cars there are by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A. According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has A + 25 books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has A + 12 books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Subtract 37 from both sides:

\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 16 \]

So Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has:

\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"First, we need to find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, we need to calculate how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4:

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. If one box of jello costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400, we can calculate her share as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the $400:

\[ \text{Keenan's share} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly expenditure} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

Pieces eaten on the first day = 2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first day.

Pieces left after the first day = 60 - 24 = 36 pieces

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.

Pieces left after the second day = 36 - 10 = 26 pieces

Now, let's calculate how many pieces he ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

Pieces eaten on the third day = 7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces he has eaten in total.

Total pieces eaten = Pieces eaten on the first day + Pieces eaten on the second day + Pieces eaten on the third day
Total pieces eaten = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

So, the final numerical answer is 48."

"First, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we know that he plans to sell each chicken for $50. To find out the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken.

\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so we need to find out how much money he spent on the chickens he sold to make this profit. We subtract the profit from the total money he will make.

\[ \text{Money spent on chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000."

So, Julie sold 2 fewer glasses than Micah, which can also be interpreted as Micah sold 2 more glasses than Julie. 

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Iris spent $400 on hair.
2. She spent 1/4 of $400 on a manicure. So, the cost of the manicure is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. She spent 3/4 of the manicure cost on a pedicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.
4. Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add up the costs of hair, manicure, and pedicure: \( 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

Money made = Length of rope × Price per meter
Money made = 20 meters × $2/meter
Money made = $40

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope at $1.5 per meter. To find out how much rope she can buy, we divide the money she has by the price per meter of the new rope.

Length of new rope = Money made ÷ Price per meter of new rope
Length of new rope = $40 ÷ $1.5/meter
Length of new rope = 26.67 meters

Since the store only sells ropes in whole meters, Sarah can only buy a 26-meter rope. Now, let's calculate how much money she will have left after buying the 26-meter rope.

Money left = Money made - (Length of new rope × Price per meter of new rope)
Money left = $40 - (26 meters × $1.5/meter)
Money left = $40 - $39
Money left = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope."
"To solve this, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Her current age is 8, so we want to find a number of years, let's call it \(x\), such that:

\(8 + x = 3 \times 8\)

Solving for \(x\):

\(8 + x = 24\)

\(x = 24 - 8\)

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. The cost of bacon:
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   So, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. The cost of chicken:
   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   So, each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. The cost of strawberries:
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. The cost of apples:
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   So, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
Money left = Budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run for, let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long the concert itself (without the encore) is. We subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert:

\[ 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

This 50 minutes is the length of the concert without the encore. Since this is twice the length of her usual concerts, we can find the usual concert length by dividing this time by 2:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes."
"Argo originally had 200 toys. He gave away 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys.

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys

So, the number of toys Argo has now = 200 - 150 = 50 toys

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them up:

- Tuesday: 125 chimichangas
- Wednesday: 125 chimichangas
- Friday: 250 chimichangas

Total chimichangas = 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas

So, the final numerical answer is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit. If 20% of the microphones won't fit, then 80% of the microphones will fit in pairs.

Total microphones = 50

Microphones that won't fit = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the microphones that will fit in pairs = 50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones that fit in pairs are arranged in pairs, we divide the number of microphones that fit by 2 to find out how many pairs we can make.

Pairs of microphones = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's find out how many birds are flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each, so:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds} \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Lani had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left after eating 5.

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars, so each jar had 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, to find out how many plants are flowering plants, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 meters per second / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find out how fast the whirligig spins. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to get the speed of the whirligig.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 meters per second * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

So, the final numerical answer is 55 meters per second."
"First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add up the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt = $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the cost of the two carrots she eats every day is:
Total cost - Cost of salad and yogurt = $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:
Cost of two carrots / 2 = $2 / 2 = $1.

So, the final numerical answer is $1."
"First, let's calculate how much Mark used to make a day. He worked 8 hours a day and made $10 an hour, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much he makes a day after the raise. His new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 an hour. So, he makes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$96/\text{day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ \$96/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$480/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$480 \]"
"First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and we know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can assume she mowed Joe's lawn once. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times.

Next, let's find out how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn five times.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, $6 * 3 = $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn, and $6 * 5 = $30 from mowing Alba's lawn. Adding these amounts together gives us her total earnings from mowing lawns:

$6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:

$80 - $54 = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time for 3 hours. So, the total hours rented in a month is:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Next, we calculate how much money John makes from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, the total money he makes in a month is:

30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to find out his profit. His profit is the total money he makes minus his car payment. His car payment is $500. So, his profit is:

$750 - $500 = $250

So, the final numerical answer is $250."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.
Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
Martha now has 7 notebooks.
Joseph has 6 notebooks.
So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is 1."
"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis' distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dijana's distance} \]
\[ \text{Anis' distance} = 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Anis' distance} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Anis' distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's distance and Anis' distance together:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis' distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Susan would have if she didn't give any to her husband. She made 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"First, let's determine how many pages each person read.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and today she read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days.

Denise's total pages: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
Daniel's total pages: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read.

So, \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine how much soup is in the pot. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. That's two bowls for adults. There are two children, and each child's bowl holds half the soup of an adult's bowl. So, each child's bowl holds 4/8 = 1/2 of an adult's bowl.

Now, we calculate the total amount of soup used for the adults:
- Calvin uses 1 bowl.
- His wife uses 1 bowl.
- Two children use 2 * (1/2) = 1 bowl.

So, the total soup used is 1 (Calvin) + 1 (wife) + 1 (children) = 3 bowls.

The pot can hold 4 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 8 child bowls. Since 3 bowls are used, the remaining soup is equivalent to 8 - 3 = 5 child bowls.

Since there are two children, each child can have 5/2 = 2.5 bowls of soup. Since we can't have half a bowl in this context, each child can have 2 full bowls of soup.

So, the final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- The cost of one notebook is $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks, so the cost for notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
- The cost of one ballpen is $0.50.
- William bought one ballpen, so the cost for the ballpen is $0.50.
- To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.

So, William spent $8.00 in all."
"To solve this, let's first find out how much material Jo needs for one small and one large mask.

For small masks:
- 2 yards of material make 4 small masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 4/2 = 2 small masks.
- Therefore, for 1 small mask, Jo needs 1/2 yard of material.

For large masks:
- 2.25 yards of material make 3 large masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 3/2.25 large masks.
- Therefore, for 1 large mask, Jo needs 1/2.25 yard of material.

Now, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
- 20 small masks * 1/2 yard per small mask = 10 yards.

For 8 large masks:
- 8 large masks * 1/2.25 yard per large mask = 8/2.25 yards.
- Simplifying 8/2.25 gives us 8/2.25 = 3.55555555556 yards (approximately).

Adding the material needed for both:
- 10 yards + 3.55555555556 yards = 13.55555555556 yards.

So, Jo would need approximately 13.56 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to calculate the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for an hour each day.
So, the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog is 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.
There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is 24 - 19 = 5 hours.
The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim has left after using 3 of them:
7 blue shoe boxes - 3 blue shoe boxes = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim has left after using 1/3 of them:
9 red shoe boxes * 1/3 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

Now, let's subtract the used red shoe boxes from the total to find out how many red shoe boxes are left:
9 red shoe boxes - 3 red shoe boxes = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.

The final numerical answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books.
Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so he had 9 * 2 = 18 books.

"Dean gives away 30 * 1/5 = 6 marbles to Jamie.
After giving 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 marbles left.
The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this, let's first figure out Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. According to the question, this age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26 years old.

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago. So, Adam will be 26 + 8 = 34 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 * 2 = 400 acres. 

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now, to find out how many acres the two farms have together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm: 

200 acres (Farmer Brown) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith) = 700 acres. 

So, the two farms together have 700 acres. 

The final numerical answer is 700."
"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Now, to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, to find out how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes in a day by the amount he gets paid per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine how long an extreme sudoku takes. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, an extreme sudoku takes:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 minutes by 30:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in that time. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of bologna used for the red balloons. Since Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, we can calculate this as:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces/bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know the total number of pieces of bologna used was 58. So, the number of pieces used for the yellow balloons is:

\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total pieces used for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, let's calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the total hours worked over the three days, we add the hours from each day:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is 23 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

The cake costs $11.

The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, so for 1 dozen (12 balloons), the cost is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \]

The ice cream costs $7 each, and they bought 2 tubs, so the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira bought 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.
Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

"First, let's calculate the number of students playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, we have:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ students playing volleyball} \]

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of boys and girls playing soccer:

\[ 16 \text{ boys} + 22 \text{ girls} = 38 \text{ students playing soccer} \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer together:

\[ 18 \text{ students} + 38 \text{ students} = 56 \text{ students} \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's find out the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5 to buy, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.
To find the total number of pets, we add all the pets together: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.
The final numerical answer is 47."
"Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday is when she turns 10 years old. To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in years and then convert that to months.

From age 5 to 10 is 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. She divides these into 3 rows equally, so each row has \(27 \div 3 = 9\) cups.
3. In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. This means each row has \(9 \div 2 = 4.5\) cups of each type of tea.
4. She uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, and the total number of cinnamon tea cups is 15.

Since the total number of cups is 27 and the cinnamon tea cups are 15, the remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea are \(27 - 15 = 12\). These 12 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea, so each type gets \(12 \div 2 = 6\) cups.

Now, since each row has 9 cups and 4.5 cups of each type of tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5.

So, the final numerical answer is 4.5."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then determine how many berries he needs to pick up per trip.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours for one trip. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, he needs to pick up:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12."
"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since the tank has half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank has:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank gives us the remaining water:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent on popcorn and candy.

He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each costs $8.
So, the total spent on popcorn is 2 * $8 = $16.

He also bought 4 boxes of candy, and each costs $2.
So, the total spent on candy is 4 * $2 = $8.

Now, let's add the cost of popcorn and candy to the total amount he has spent on tickets.

He has $150 to spend on tickets.
He has already spent $16 on popcorn and $8 on candy.
So, the remaining amount for tickets is $150 - $16 - $8 = $126.

Now, let's calculate how many tickets he can buy with the remaining $126.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each.
Tickets for other days cost $7 each.

He already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he has spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those tickets.
He also saw 8 movies on other days, so he has spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those tickets.

So, the total spent on tickets is $50 + $56 = $106.

Now, subtract the amount already spent on tickets from the remaining amount for tickets.
$126 - $106 = $20.

With the remaining $20, he can buy 2 more tickets (since each ticket costs $10).

Now, let's add up all the tickets he has seen:
5 (Friday/Saturday) + 8 (other days) + 2 (remaining) = 15 tickets.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out the calories for mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- So, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

For mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- So, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories for mini cinnamon rolls is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories for mini blueberry muffins is \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories for both types of pastries:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

So, the total calories for the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that number by 5.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day. Since she did this for two days, that's \(78 \times 2 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300\]

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

So, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"First, we calculate the distance the bus traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance the bus traveled is:
\[ 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the car traveled. Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance the car traveled is:
\[ 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie already has is:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys for her nephew.

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now:
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys already had) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, Pa, and J respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express P in terms of J:

\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute both expressions for P and Pa into the first equation:

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age (J = 20), we can find Paul's age (Pa):

\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And we can find Peter's age (P):

\[ P = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is 50 years. The final numerical answer is:

50"
"Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. Maria also got 2 balloons. So before her mom gave them more, they had 8 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons.

Adding the balloons before and after her mom gave them more, the total number of balloons is 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
They also have 10 boxes already.

So, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so to find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table:

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2 (since there are two people):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is:
\[ 410 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In a day with 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In a day with 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets at $6 each.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option. The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. This includes the initial 12-hour stay and an additional 5 hours.

The cost for the initial 12-hour stay is 1600 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, Cameron will pay 70 pesos per hour. So, the cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for the 17-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1950 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour stay option instead of the 17-hour stay option. The cost for the 12-hour stay is 1600 pesos, and the cost for the 17-hour stay is 1950 pesos. The savings would be:
\[ 1950 \text{ pesos} - 1600 \text{ pesos} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron would save 350 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, twice the amount each goat needs is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this amount:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, so the total hay needed for the goats is:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, so the total hay needed for the sheep is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep together gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge, we need to add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

The visit fee is $40.
The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
The parts cost is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
$35 * 2.25 = $78.75

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$40 (visit fee) + $78.75 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $178.75

So, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. The discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The money he gets from selling these CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for him to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance he needs to swim, which is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims this remaining distance at half the speed, which is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:
\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time it took James to get across the lake:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had by following the given information.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate the number of loaves the bakery has as follows:

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Then, we subtract 40 from this number to find out how many loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers. Then she gets 5 more stickers, so she has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers. The final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times, and each copy costs $5. So, the commission per New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \]
For 6 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. He gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal, and each copy costs $15. So, the commission per Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \]
For 10 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, we add the two totals to find the overall commission:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"If Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, then Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

The final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

According to the problem, Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us the following equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We also know that the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

Since \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A - 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 35 \]
\[ A = 10 \]

So, Azibo scored 10 points."

"Vince started stapling at 8:00 AM and continued until 11:00 PM. That's a total of 5 hours and 0 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5 hours is equal to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

If Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, then in 300 minutes he can staple 300 / 15 = 20 sets of 30 reports.

So, the total number of reports he stapled is 20 * 30 = 600 reports.

The final numerical answer is 600."
"Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to calculate the time she was not sleepwalking.

From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes. She woke up at 5:55 a.m., so we need to calculate the time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. to find out how much time she spent on her bed.

From 2:15 a.m. to 5:15 a.m. is 3 hours and 15 minutes, which is 195 minutes. From 5:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 40 minutes. So, the total time she was not sleepwalking is 195 + 40 = 235 minutes.

Since she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, the time she slept on her bed is 235 - 23 = 212 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 212."
"First, let's find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

- Two dozen measuring cups mean he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.
- Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

- 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

- 24 measuring cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils.

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. If the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, then:

\[ \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the number of patients admitted is:

\[ \text{Patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the patients admitted to the initially occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Since Robyn sends sixteen emails a day and seven of them are work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total:

16 - 7 = 9 emails are not work emails.

Out of these 9 emails, two-thirds are to family. To find out how many emails are to family, we calculate:

9 * (2/3) = 6 emails are to family.

Now, we subtract the emails to family from the non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:

9 - 6 = 3 emails are not to family or family.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

3 * (1/3) = 1 email is to her boyfriend.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"If Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

5 * 9 = 45 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and that was 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of people.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number is 120% of \( x \) (since 100% is the actual number and 20% more is 120%).

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \).
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"If Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, then Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
29 / 4 = 7.25 holes

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the interpretation. However, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as it's the closest whole number).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
29 + (holes dug on the fourth day) = 4 * 7 = 28

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
28 - 29 = -1

Since digging a negative number of holes doesn't make sense in this context, we need to re-evaluate the interpretation. Given the problem's context, it seems the number of holes at the end of the first day is indeed 7, and the number of holes at the end of the third day is 29. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
29 - 29 + 2 = 2

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 2.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got:
70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey got, Collins got:
70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Adding up all the corn chips, we get:
140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as A. According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can express the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as 4A - 13. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8.

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. So we can write the equation:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Combining like terms, we get:

9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:

9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. To find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught, we use the expression for Stan's catch:

Stan's catch = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"If each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then the number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10 episodes.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance she traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she had 12 brownies.
- At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received 6 brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies. Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received 48 brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18, 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
- Brownies from herself: 12
- Brownies from her office: 6
- Brownies from her friends' party: 48
- Brownies eaten during the party: -18

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25 / 100 * 8 = 2 years less than Nani, so she is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.
The total age of all three is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.
The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total time Andy will spend on each type of racquet:

- For synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes each = 45 minutes
- For polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes each = 110 minutes
- For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes each = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time:

45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first two phones cost the full price, which is $600 each.
   - Cost of first phone: $600
   - Cost of second phone: $600
   - Total cost for first two phones: $600 + $600 = $1200

2. The remaining phones (after the first two) are half price.
   - John has 3 more people (himself, his 2 kids, and his wife) to buy phones for, so he needs 3 more phones.
   - Each of these 3 phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.

3. Total cost for the remaining 3 phones:
   - Cost of third phone: $300
   - Cost of fourth phone: $300
   - Cost of fifth phone: $300
   - Total cost for remaining 3 phones: $300 + $300 + $300 = $900

4. Adding the cost of all the phones together:
   - Total cost: $1200 (first two phones) + $900 (remaining three phones) = $2100

So, John paid $2100 for the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.
Combined, both teams have 13 + 20 = 33 players.
The final numerical answer is 33."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, we add the lengths of all four sides together. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given that the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he needs:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:
12 boxes

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so:
2 + 2 = 4 boxes given away

Now, let's find out how many boxes she kept:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the remaining 3/4 were sold. To find out how many boxes were sold, we calculate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges sold is:
9 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 180 oranges

So, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Now, let's find out how many states India has. The question states that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the USA's states is 50 / 2 = 25. Adding 4 to this gives us 25 + 4 = 29 states in India.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India: 50 + 29 = 79.

So, the final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the amount he still needs to buy the books is:
$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"First, let's determine how many boxes of each type of baked good Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

Total gingerbread sold:
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

Total apple pie sold:
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good.

Earnings from gingerbread:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

Earnings from apple pie:
- Each box of apple pie costs $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

Total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

The final numerical answer is $465."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour and she will be outside for 4 hours each day. So, each day she will use:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, she will use:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles are needed for 32 ounces. We do this by dividing the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price. 

To find the price of the red car, we calculate 60% of $100:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 years old.
3. At that time, his dad will be twice Emil's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old, which confirms our previous calculation.
5. Emil's brother will be half of Emil's age at that time, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
6. Now, we need to find out how old Emil's dad and brother are now.
7. Since Emil is 19 and his brother is 12 when Emil is 24, we can calculate their current ages:
   - Emil's dad is 48 - 24 = 24 years older than Emil, so he is 24 + 19 = 43 years old now.
   - Emil's brother is 12 - 24 = 12 years younger than Emil, so he is 19 - 12 = 7 years old now.
8. The sum of their current ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which means her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days:

- Total crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch
- Total crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is:

- Number of servings = Total crawfish ÷ 3 pounds per serving
- Number of servings = 21 pounds ÷ 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining students are:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size 5 * 5 = 25 boots.

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2. So, the average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The flower bed is 111 feet long, so:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, the total space required for one plant including the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ more plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 162 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."

   - Sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00
   - Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

2. **Calculate the cost for all 5 baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

For the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, and she can only spend $500.00 a month on shoes. So, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number she can peel in a minute:

90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number she can saute in a minute and then multiply by the time it takes:

90 shrimp ÷ 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, in 3 hours it will cool the room by:
\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours. Since it cools the room by 3 degrees an hour, in 4 hours it will cool the room by:
\[ 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up by 2 degrees an hour, in 2 hours it will warm up the room by:
\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add up all the temperature changes:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} + 4 \text{ degrees} = -2 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine how old Bill's father was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
15"

- 1 check per month for the electric bill
- 1 check per month for the gas bill
- 2 checks per month for the church
- 1 check per year for the pest and lawn service

To find the total number of checks he writes in a year, we add these up:

1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) + 1 (pest and lawn) = 5 checks per year

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The first plane makes 44 trips in total (since 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes).
   - Therefore, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece, France, and Germany:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece 88 * 3/4 = 66 times.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11, and the number of flights to Germany is also 11.

So, the first plane takes 66 flights to France in one day.

The final numerical answer is:
66"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's add up the total duration of all their howls:
\[ \text{Total duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Total duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of their individual ages:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ 20 = 17 + W \]
\[ W = 20 - 17 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which means everyone else has donated $200.

So, the lawyer's donation will be:
$200 * 3 = $600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600."
"First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this, let's assume each kid gets a slice of 1 unit of the watermelon. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big, each adult gets 2 units of the watermelon.

So, the total units of the watermelon distributed are:
- 4 kids * 1 unit/kid = 4 units
- 2 adults * 2 units/adult = 4 units

This means the total units of the watermelon are 4 (kids) + 4 (adults) = 8 units.

Each adult gets 2 units out of the total 8 units. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Units each adult gets}}{\text{Total units}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes.

Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities.

Total time spent = Time for inpatient rounds + Time for appointments
Total time spent = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes to compare.

Total clinic time = 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes

Now, let's find out how much time he has left to update his records.

Time left = Total clinic time - Total time spent
Time left = 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

Finally, we need to convert the remaining time from minutes to hours.

Time left in hours = 60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"First, let's add up all the time required to make, bake, cool, and frost the cake:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time needed to complete the cake from start to finish.

Now, we need to convert 5:00 pm into minutes past midnight to find out how much time is left before 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm is 17:00 in 24-hour format. 

From midnight to 5:00 pm is 17 hours. Converting hours into minutes:

17 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1020 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time needed to make the cake from the time at 5:00 pm:

1020 minutes - 180 minutes = 840 minutes

To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we convert 840 minutes back into hours and minutes:

840 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 14 hours

14 hours from midnight is 2:00 am.

So, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 am.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 am."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes they sold together.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Total babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate that.
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are needed. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate that.
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate that.
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. Distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for Matteo:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of these students are over 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)
- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)

Now, let's find the number of female students:

- Female students over 16 years old: \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)
- Female students under 16 years old: \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

Total female students: \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \)

So, the final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\(10 - 5 = 5\)

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda's contribution on the first day = 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the first day = 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Wanda's contribution on the second day = 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
   - Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the second day = 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is **6000 gallons**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge would be:
   - After 1 hour: 100% - 9% = 91%
   - After 2 hours: 91% - 9% = 82%
   - After 3 hours: 82% - 9% = 73%
   - After 4 hours: 73% - 9% = 64%
   - After 5 hours: 64% - 9% = 55%
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge would be:
   - After 6 hours: 55% - 7% = 48%
   - After 7 hours: 48% - 7% = 41%
   - After 8 hours: 41% - 7% = 34%

Now, we know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining was 28%. This means that the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 100%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 100%."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.5 (peaches) + $2.0 (pears) + $2.0 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After buying the fruits he has already purchased, he has:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. With $0.75, he can buy:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3 plums.

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to find out the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. Since she bought a box with 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. So, we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. Since she had 15 packs in total and kept 2, she gave away:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs were given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can find out how many pieces each friend received by multiplying the number of packs each friend got by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase year by year.

The initial price of carrots is $120.

After the first year, the price increases by 5% of $120:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{5}{100} = 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Price after first year} = 120 + 6 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price increases by 5% of $126:
\[ \text{Increase} = 126 \times \frac{5}{100} = 126 \times 0.05 = 6.3 \]
\[ \text{Price after second year} = 126 + 6.3 = 132.3 \]

After the third year, the price increases by 5% of $132.3:
\[ \text{Increase} = 132.3 \times \frac{5}{100} = 132.3 \times 0.05 = 6.615 \]
\[ \text{Price after third year} = 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album. Then we can determine how many selfies and portraits there are based on the information given.

First, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album has 9 pictures. Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. This means the remaining albums are not selfies or portraits, but since we are only asked about selfies and portraits, we can ignore these.

Now, we calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
\[ \text{Total selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
\[ \text{Total portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion because the reading speed is constant.

If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages would take:
\[ \text{Time for 18 pages} = \left(\frac{18 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ pages}}\right) \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 6 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"First, let's calculate the number of guests who checked out. Initially, there were 100 guests. 24 guests checked out early and 15 checked out late. So, the total number of guests who checked out is:

24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) = 39 guests

Now, subtract these from the initial number of guests:

100 (initial guests) - 39 (checked out) = 61 guests

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:

2 * 15 = 30 guests

So, 30 guests checked in in the afternoon. Adding these to the remaining guests:

61 (remaining guests) + 30 (checked in) = 91 guests

After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:

91 (after adding the afternoon guests) + 7 (checked in after dinner) = 98 guests

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas from each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get right is:
- Easy questions she is sure to get right: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get right is:
- Average and difficult questions she is sure to get right: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 questions

Now, let's add up the questions she is sure to get right:
- Total sure questions = Easy questions she is sure to get right + Average and difficult questions she is sure to get right
- Total sure questions = 18 + 9 = 27 questions

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large ones cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The total earnings from the large stuffed animals are:
\[ 12x \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the small stuffed animals are:
\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in a day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so the money from cookies is:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so the money from cupcakes is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the $20 given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. If there were 100 eggs hidden and 10 were not found, then 100 - 10 = 90 eggs were found. Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. We know that with an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine twice as much as with their bare hands, and with a steel pickaxe, they can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.

1 dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds/day} \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds/day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine:
\[ 24 \text{ pounds/day} \times 1.5 = 36 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

The total amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day is 36 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day is:
\[ 36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 40 = 1440 \text{ pounds/day} \]

For a month with 30 days, the total amount of ore they can mine is:
\[ 1440 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 43200 \]"
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so each sandwich costs $3/2 = $1.50. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so each sandwich costs $6/4 = $1.50. Since the prices are proportional, the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches should also be $1.50 per sandwich times 8.

Let's calculate the cost of the third package:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12 \]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's calculate how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, the amount he needs to pay for the new bedroom set is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this amount per month. To find out how much he has to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons left is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She started with 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons left is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \text{ balloons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.
2. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

So, if the normal teacher comes in, the chance he has to turn in his homework is 80% (the 20% chance he doesn't get a personal extension).

Now, we need to consider the probability of the normal teacher coming in, which is 50%, and the probability of the substitute teacher coming in, which is also 50%.

The overall chance he has to turn in his homework is calculated as follows:
- The chance the normal teacher comes in and he has to turn in his homework is 50% * 80% = 40%.
- The chance the substitute teacher comes in and he has to turn in his homework is 50% * 100% = 50%.

Adding these probabilities together gives us the total chance he has to turn in his homework:
40% + 50% = 90%.

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 90%."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Seats reserved for graduates: 950
Seats reserved for faculty: 300

Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000

Seats available for graduates and their guests = Total capacity - Total reserved seats
= 6000 - 1250 = 4750

If the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets each graduate would receive = Seats available for graduates and their guests / Number of graduates
= 4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply:

\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the jury duty:
$15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
$3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, let's find out her net pay after expenses:
$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net pay by the total hours:
$36 / 18 hours = $2/hour

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at 16 dollars each, so the total cost for the books is:
3 books * 16 dollars/book = 48 dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at 6 dollars each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
3 pencils * 6 dollars/pencil = 18 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent:
48 dollars (books) + 18 dollars (pencils) = 66 dollars

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. So, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the second, then to the third, and so on, he will need to make 7 trips (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh to the eighth). Each trip takes 5 seconds, so we multiply the number of trips by the time per trip:

\[ 7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds/trip} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[ 35 \text{ seconds} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many apples are in two boxes. Since one box has forty apples, two boxes will have:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mo buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost for Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mo buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost for mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Now, let's add the costs of both cheeses to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = $22 + $18 = $40.

Mo starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Mo will have $10 left to buy meat."
"First, let's calculate how much Jim borrowed in total. He took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after college. His original income was $25,000 a year, and his income tripled with his college degree, so his new income is:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 a year for 4 years:
\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between what he would have earned if he had not gone to college and what he actually earned:
\[ 100,000 - 75,000 = 25,000 \]

Now, let's add the total amount of loans he took out to the money lost from not working while in school:
\[ 200,000 + 25,000 = 225,000 \]

To find out how long it would take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000 a year, we divide the total amount by his new income:
\[ \frac{225,000}{75,000} = 3 \]

So, it would take Jim 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

So, the area of one piece of fabric is:

\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:

\[ \text{Total Area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

First, we know that on Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

For Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]
Then, we add 17 to this amount:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 102 letters.

For Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. So, we first calculate twice Tuesday's deliveries:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then, we add 5 to this amount:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 209 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the deliveries of each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad. 10 people want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, the total cost for the chicken salad is:
10 * $6.50 = $65.00

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad. 6 people want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, the total cost for the pasta salad is:
6 * $6 = $36.00

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the final numerical answer is $101.00."
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's determine the amount lost in each race:
- In the first race, he lost $5.
- In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $1 + (2 * $5) = $1 + $10 = $11. Since he won, we consider this as a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we'll consider it as $11 lost.
- In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5

Now, we need to find the average amount lost per race:
Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
Average amount lost = $32.5 / 3 = $10.8333...

Rounded to two decimal places, the average amount lost is $10.83.

So, the final numerical answer is:
10.83"
"To solve this, we need to find the total population of all the cities in South America.

1. First, we know there are 26 countries in South America.
2. Each country has 5 cities.
3. Each city has 1000 people living in it.

So, to find the total number of cities in South America, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities/country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, to find the total population, we multiply the total number of cities by the number of people living in each city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people/city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population of South America is 130,000 people."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person's share is $420.

The final numerical answer is:
420"
"First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. So, the total number of days each painter worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours each painter worked is:
\[ 7.875 \times 24 = 191.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
191.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

So, we can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the value for each year:

- In 2007, the car's value is $20000.
- In 2008, the value is $20000 * 0.79.
- In 2009, the value is the result of 2008 * 0.79.
- In 2010, the value is the result of 2009 * 0.79.

Now, let's do the math:

- 2008 value: $20000 * 0.79 = $15800
- 2009 value: $15800 * 0.79 = $12442
- 2010 value: $12442 * 0.79 = $9752.98

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9752.98."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the books are in English, we have:

\[ \text{English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we have:

\[ \text{German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{English books} + \text{German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers so far.

1955 - 325 = 1630 kilometers

The final numerical answer is 1630 kilometers."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups a day, we multiply 8 by 30.

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. We know that 16 cups make a gallon. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to get the number of gallons.

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

3. **At the second stop:** 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)) board the train.
   - People after disembarking: \(140 - 50 = 90\).
   - People after boarding: \(90 + 100 = 190\).
4. **At the third stop:** 80 more people disembark.
   - Final number of people: \(190 - 80 = 110\).

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. So, you need 200 tiles.

Now, to find the total cost, you multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile. Each tile costs $12.

So, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final numerical answer is $2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased cost of the insurance due to the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. To find out how much the increase is, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = \$72 \]

So, the increased cost of the insurance is:

\[ \$120 + \$72 = \$192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the monthly increased cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \$192 \times 12 = \$2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2304 \]"
"First, let's determine how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. A twin set of sheets consists of 2 twin beds, so for 4 twin beds, he needs 2 sets. For the king size bed, he needs 1 set. So, in total, he needs to wash 2 + 1 = 3 sets of sheets each week.

Next, we know that his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. Since he needs to wash 3 sets of sheets each week, he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one load. This means he only needs to do 1 load of laundry each week.

Now, let's calculate how many loads he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 52 loads of laundry in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
52"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. So, they watch \(4 \div 2 = 2\) movies on Sunday.
3. In one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.
4. Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends.
5. Therefore, in 4 weeks, they can watch \(6 \times 4 = 24\) movies.

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is 150 + 100 = 250 stickers."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate how much cat food Imma's cats consume in total each day.

Each cat gets 60 grams of food twice a day, so each cat eats:
60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per day.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed by all cats in one day is:
120 grams * 3 = 360 grams per day.

Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days.

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate by adding the slices each person ate:
Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The final numerical answer is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can denote Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost for 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost for parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80 * 0.20 = 16 emails don't need a response each day.

So, the number of emails James does need to respond to each day is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5.

So, 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final numerical answer is 320."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them all up:

- Monday: 32
- Tuesday: 64
- Wednesday: 96
- Thursday: 30
- Friday: 25

Total = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

Let's add these numbers:

32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we add them up: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Then, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 4: 380 ÷ 4 = 95.

So, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
This means the glee club has:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
This means the football team has:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find out how many pizzas are left in total. The glee club has 6 pizzas left and the football team has 8 pizzas left, so:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ 245 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered is:

7 + 3 = 10 meatball sub sandwiches

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is:

10 - 4 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had problems, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ \text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that reached the farmers is:

\[ \text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants.
2. He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
3. So, for 6 dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.
4. The store has a promotion: buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he only pays for 1 pound.
5. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, so he can get 6 pounds with this promotion. Since the promotion is buy one pound and get one half off, he only pays for 3 pounds of butter (because the other 3 pounds are half off).

Now, let's calculate the cost:

- The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00.
- For 3 pounds, he pays $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 for the next two pounds (since the second and third pounds are half off).

So, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:

Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people

She also invited 4 people who couldn't come, so the total number of people who will attend is:
45 - 4 = 41 people

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, and then $6 for each additional guest. Since 41 people are attending, there are 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21).

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 * $6 = $126

So, the total cost for the party is the rental fee plus the cost for the additional guests:
$125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

The final numerical answer is $85."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week. Since the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, in a week (7 days) it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's find out how many bananas the second monkey eats in a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we know the total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 70 \text{ bananas} - 98 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy placed 250 pieces in the first puzzle because half of 500 is 250. For the second puzzle, Teddy placed 500 pieces. So, in total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she gets in change. Since she needs $5 in change, and quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she gets is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00

Now, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Finally, let's add up all the money he makes:
$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To solve this, let's break down the schedule of the trains:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train arrives.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul will wait for his train:

- The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The second train arrives in 40 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The third train arrives in 100 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The fourth train arrives in 120 minutes, and Paul will board it.

So, Paul will wait for the first train for 10 minutes, the second train for 40 minutes, and the third train for 100 minutes. The total time Paul will wait is 10 + 40 + 100 = 150 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 150 minutes."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then determine how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers bought the watch for. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate how much less the friend paid compared to the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this, we need to understand how many seconds are in 4 hours and then calculate how many jellyfish are created.

1 hour = 60 minutes
60 minutes = 3600 seconds (since 1 minute = 60 seconds)

So, 4 hours = 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds

If one spring creates one jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, 14400 jellyfish would be created by one spring.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created would be:

14400 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

So, the final numerical answer is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we first need to understand the relationship between Frankie's and Binkie's scores. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 points more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 points to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's break down the journey James made:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

If each banana costs $0.80, then the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Each bunch costs $3.00, and Jenny buys 10 bunches, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:
10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The savings would be the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

We also know that the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we can calculate the growth rate per year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years.

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, we can calculate how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13 years.

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

- The total number of bikes sold is 300.
- Half of them were Trekking bikes, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes sold is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).
- The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold.

- The price of one MTB is $500, so the total earnings from MTB bikes is \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).
- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \), so the total earnings from BMX bikes is \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so the total earnings from Trekking bikes is \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the bikes to find the total earnings for the month.

Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
Total earnings = \( 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \)

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6 hour day, the farmer makes:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over a 6 hour day, the truck picks up:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

If the farmer makes 30 bales and the truck picks up 18 bales in a 6 hour day, the number of bales left in the field is:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods per day} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class each day is:

\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes per day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time spent in class each week is:

\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes per week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the extra learning time each week is:

\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28.33 \]"
"First, we need to find out the starting height of the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height of the third floor is:
\[ 24 \text{ feet/story} \times 3 \text{ stories} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. So, for the first bounce, the height the ball reaches is:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce:
\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert everything to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The orchard sells each bag for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's work backwards to find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

1. The lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. Before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the original amount of meat. So, the original amount of meat was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is 2160 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the total area of the north and south walls. Each of these walls is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the total area of the east and west walls. Each of these walls is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

The final numerical answer is 144."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves:
   - 2 shaken sodas (since 3 were shaken and 1 was taken by Ellen's brother)
   - 6 unshaken sodas (since 8 were unshaken and 2 were taken by Ellen's brother)
4. Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can get soda from either the 2 shaken sodas or the 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 8 (2 shaken + 6 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend gets soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
25%"
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it's traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.
In 3 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.
In 3 hours, the second train would have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.
Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances together to find the total distance between them.
So, after 3 hours, they are 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so the total is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days. 80% of 50 days is 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Over the 40 days he works, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses, so the total number of people in the buses is:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars, so the total number of people in the cars is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people who were inside the church:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 480 \]"
"First, we need to find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to calculate how long it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide. The length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute. To find the time it takes to slide down, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:

\[ \text{Time for biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide. The length of the second biggest waterslide is 240 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute. To find the time it takes to slide down, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:

\[ \text{Time for second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long. So, the total break time per day is:
15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, add the lunch time:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

So, Bobby spends 60 minutes on his lunches and breaks each day.

To find out how many hours this is, we convert minutes to hours:
60 minutes = 1 hour

Now, to find out how many hours this adds up to after 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge on her card is reduced by $15.00.

\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:

\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

So, the frying pan cost:

\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

Then, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:

\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]

So, the towels cost:

\[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance on her credit card:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:

\[ 113.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"If Chris is 4 years old and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is:

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \]

So, Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

Next, we need to determine how much she will live on each year after retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years Lauren can live on her savings if she saves $20,000 each year. We divide her annual living expenses by her annual savings:

\[ \frac{40,000}{20,000} = 2 \]

So, Lauren can live for 2 years on her savings. Since she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we subtract the 2 years she can live on her savings from the total retirement period:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 18 more years to save enough for her retirement. The final numerical answer is:

18"
"To find out how long each final cut will be, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
$19 (pots) + $26 (soil) = $45

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add the heights of all the heels together and then divide by the total number of heels.

There are 3 heels that are 4 inches tall and 3 heels that are 2 inches tall. So, the total height of the heels is:

\( 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 2 = 12 + 6 = 18 \) inches.

The total number of heels is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \).

Now, to find the average height of the heels, we divide the total height by the total number of heels:

\( \frac{18}{6} = 3 \) inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, let's calculate the total number of miles Soledad wants to hike in June. She plans to hike 9,300 miles.

Next, we need to determine how many miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

Soledad walks twice a day, so:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

If she walks 250 miles each day, the total number of miles she can hike in June is:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles, and she can only hike 7,500 miles in June. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we first calculate the total additional miles she needs to hike:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each color of ball:

Red balls: 3 balls * $9/ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5/ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3/ball = $75

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the balls:

Total cost = Cost of red balls + Cost of blue balls + Cost of green balls
Total cost = $27 + $55 + $75
Total cost = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much apples each person wants.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of 12 kg:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add up the amounts that Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since they bought 12 kg in total, we subtract the amount they want from the total to find out how much James will have left:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees, so we subtract 8 from the initial 2 degrees: 
2 - 8 = -6 degrees.
Then it increased by 3 degrees in the morning, so we add 3 to -6:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees.
The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so he had $21 + $11 = $32. Then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which totals $5 + $19 = $24. So, the money he has left is $32 - $24 = $8.

The final numerical answer is $8."
"First, let's find out how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

dollars in total.

She has already spent $4, so the amount she spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

dollars. Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total cost of the books by 2:

\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5."
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year's enrollment was 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. To find the total enrollment this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"First, we need to find out how many times the light blinks in one minute. Since it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we divide 255 by 5 to find the rate of blinking per minute.

\[ \text{Blink rate per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by the blink rate per minute.

\[ \text{Time to blink 459 times} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after buying more.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

He buys:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add the new ones to the initial count:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11

Now, subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference: 16 - 11 = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
(Note: The problem states ""over 4 hours longer,"" so we assume it's more than 4 hours but less than 9 hours, but for calculation, we'll use 9 hours as the minimum.)

Now, we add up the time each person took:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, we need to find out the distance John travels one way. We know that speed is distance over time, so distance is speed times time. John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there, so the distance one way is:

\[ \text{Distance one way} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

Since John makes a round trip, he drives this distance twice. So, the total distance for the round trip is:

\[ \text{Total distance for round trip} = 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 560 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 560 miles."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:
10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk:
70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 35 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Adding these together, the total number of toys produced by all 4 workers in one hour is:
\[ 12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys in 10 hours. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced some toys to reach the total of 400 toys. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour."
"First, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of both of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris originally had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
2. Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, so Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce has 30 M&Ms, 30 ounces will have:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ 900 \div 10 = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. If the average car can go 120 miles per hour and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, then:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, to find the speed of the faster car:

\[ \text{Speed of faster car} = 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the faster car goes 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first figure out Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

According to the question, two years ago Liam's age (14) was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number \( A \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \) and the number of eggs Camden painted \( C \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).
4. We can substitute the second equation into the third to find \( S \):
   \[
   S + 12 + S = 30 \implies 2S + 12 = 30 \implies 2S = 18 \implies S = 9
   \]
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Then, Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.
5. Now we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We can write the equation for the total number of eggs painted:
   \[
   A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \implies 2A + 30 = 56 \implies 2A = 26 \implies A = 13
   \]
   So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.
6. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8
   \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ \text{Number of planks} = 16 \times 5 = 80 \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, then the total amount he makes is:

\[ \text{Total money made} = 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"First, let's determine Grandma's speed on the beach. If she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time for 1 mile on beach} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time for 1 mile on sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time for her to complete the 3-mile walk is:

\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

She wants to save a total of $60, so she needs to save:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

If she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save $28 is:
\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, let's add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob has initially. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives us:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 of the marbles, we subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this, we need to ensure that after Donny pours some water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

First, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. The temperature of the water in the bottle from the 33-degree mug will be:
\[ \frac{4}{4 + 1} \times 33 = \frac{4}{5} \times 33 = 26.4 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, Donny pours 1 ounce from the second mug into the bottle. The temperature of the water in the bottle from the second mug will be:
\[ \frac{1}{4 + 1} \times T = \frac{1}{5} \times T \]

The total temperature of the water in the bottle will be the sum of the temperatures from both mugs:
\[ 26.4 + \frac{1}{5} \times T \]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this total temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ 26.4 + \frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 40 \]

Now, let's solve for \( T \):
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 40 - 26.4 \]
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 13.6 \]
\[ T \geq 13.6 \times 5 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 68 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, let's calculate the number of cows and chickens added by each company over these 21 days.

For Milkie Cows Limited:
20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

For Broilers Limited:
10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Total cows after three weeks:
50 initial cows + 420 cows from Milkie Cows Limited = 470 cows

Total chickens after three weeks:
20 initial chickens + 210 chickens from Broilers Limited = 230 chickens

Finally, let's find the total number of animals on the farm:
470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the final numerical answer is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he gets a 10% discount for ordering 4 packs, the discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs will have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00."
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, 3 less than 6 is:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his intake to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 9."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects over a decade (10 years).

First, we know that Tim gets 6 lemons from each tree each year. Since he has 5 trees, we can calculate the number of lemons he gets from all trees in one year:

\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade (10 years), we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's find out how many men and women are on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If the total number of passengers is 84, then each part of the ratio represents 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.

So, the number of women on the bus initially is 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women.

If 20 women alight from the bus, then the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34 women.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day from selling the sunflowers individually.

The cost of one sunflower is $2. If Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers, then the number of sunflowers sold in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in one day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Next, let's calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day from selling the bouquet.

The cost of one bouquet is $8. If Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets, then the number of bouquets sold in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold in one day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from selling bouquets in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets in one day} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by adding the sunflowers sold individually and from the bouquets:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} + 84 \text{ sunflowers} = 97 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold in one day by 3:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 291 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 291 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84 \]

Adam initially had $100 and now has $84 after selling the rocks. The loss is the difference between what he had initially and what he has now.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the scenes based on her daily rates for each type of scene.

For large-sized scenes:
She can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For medium-sized scenes:
She can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For small-sized scenes:
She can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up the days for all types of scenes:
9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

So, it will take her 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty has prepared 3 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs. If she divides these 36 eggs equally among her four children, each child would get 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.

"To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, let's calculate the total distance Sid traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Sid traveled:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is:

\[ 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"First, let's understand the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

For the first ticket, the probability of winning is 20%, which can be written as 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 times the probability of the first ticket winning. 

\[ \text{Probability of the second ticket winning} = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning since the events are independent.

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets winning} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

Jim collected 27 seashells.

Since Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from Jim's total:
\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing Carlos's total by 2:
\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among the three of them, so each person gets:
\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person gets \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells."
"To calculate how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. So, the total for weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekends. There are 2 days in the weekend, and he eats 5 carrots each day on the weekend. So, the total for the weekend is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on weekends to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the selling price of one mobile device. Linus sells it for twice the original price, which is $20. So, the selling price is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the original price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device gives a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane:

\[ \text{Carl's cane length} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Carl's cane length} = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ \text{Carl's cane length} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is 3 feet."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, we need 5 bottles per person, which means we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles in total.

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total needed:

11500 bottles needed - 4200 bottles produced = 7300 bottles.

So, the final numerical answer is 7300 bottles."
"First, let's determine how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
So, 6 babies are dressed in purple.

The remaining 1/4 of them are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows. All the babies dressed in blue also wear bows, and 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, 2 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows.

Now, we have:
- 2 babies wearing bows and dressed in blue.
- 2 babies wearing bows and dressed in purple.

In total, there are:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]
babies wearing bows.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters of land, half of that is:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, let's calculate how much land he sold in the second transaction. He sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters of land, 1/4 of that is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land he has left to sell. He originally had 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters in the first transaction, and then sold 20 square meters in the second transaction. So, the remaining land is:

\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He will sell the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. So, the money he will earn from selling the remaining land is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- So, the total for the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the other two combined:
- The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 400.
- 60% of 400 is 0.60 * 400 = 240.
- So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the number of apartments in all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, so he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. So, for 1040 apartments, he gets:
- 1040 * $0.40 = $416.

Therefore, the total money John makes in a week is $416."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Next, solve for \( Y \):

\[ 6Y = 37 + 35 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Now, we know that Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's pocket is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The yellow paint makes up half the mural, so if the total paint is 12 pints, then the yellow paint is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Now, we can write the equation for the total paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, which is:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: Double of Monday, so 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: Double of Tuesday, so 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: Double of Wednesday, so 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
- Friday: Double of Thursday, so 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

Now, let's add them all up:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

For $1, the number of pods we can buy is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \]

Since we can only run full cycles with whole pods, we can run 8 cycles with $1.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 and each bill is $20, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling the 20 bills means he has:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \times 20 = 1200 \]

Thomas then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, Thomas has 240 five dollar bills. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

Total goals = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then figure out how many days he can use the chalk before he has to recycle it.

First, let's calculate how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can calculate the amount of chalk used as follows:

\[ \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \times \frac{45}{100} = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, the chalk left after Monday is:

\[ \text{Chalk left after Monday} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher uses only 20% of the chalk each day after Monday. So, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day. This means he uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day, so the chalk left after each day is 80% of the chalk left at the beginning of that day.

Let's denote the amount of chalk left after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). Initially, \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches. After the first day, the chalk left is:

\[ C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 \]

After the second day, the chalk left is:

\[ C_2 = C_1 \times 0.80 = 2.75 \times 0.80^2 \]

And so on. We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches (since he has to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches).

Let's calculate the amount of chalk left after each day:

\[ C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \]
\[ C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \]
\[ C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \]
\[ C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \]
\[ C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.89952 \]

After 4 days, the chalk left is 1.1264 inches, and after 5 days, the chalk left is 0.89952 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 4 more days before he has to recycle it.

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of students on varsity:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students on varsity} \]

The total number of students in Miss Albert's class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find out how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Now, let's calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike means we multiply the number of masks Mike bought by 3. So, 3 times 5 is 15.

Then, we add 2 more to that number. So, 15 plus 2 equals 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, let's find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. He drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth, so he fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus originally bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk.

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount by multiplying the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand both sides:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's age and checking the conditions of the problem.

If Colin is 20 years old, then seven years from now he will be 27 years old. According to the first condition:
\[ W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be 45 years old. According to the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. If he can buy 100 books for $500, then the cost per book is $500 / 100 = $5.

Now, with $27000, he can buy $27000 / $5 = 5400 books.

Since he is distributing this amount between 3 schools, he can give each school 5400 / 3 = 1800 books.

So, the final numerical answer is 1800."
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of those apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. He picked up the other apple and threw it into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now he has 1 + 5 = 6 apples.
4. He picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket and threw the remaining 1 apple at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out. Now he has 1 apple.
5. He picked up these 1 apple and threw it at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now he has 1 + 6 = 7 apples.
6. He picked up all of these 7 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag weighs 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we divide the total weight by the weight of each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

306"
"First, let's calculate how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pepperoni pizza slices her friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices} \]

Now, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}}{12 \text{ slices per cheese pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Similarly, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pepperoni pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up all the miles he ran each day.

From the information given:
- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. That's 3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 19 miles."
"First, let's figure out how many snowballs Jay can make in an hour before any melt. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in an hour (which is 60 minutes), 4 snowballs would melt.

So, in an hour, Jay can make:
20 snowballs - 4 melted snowballs = 16 snowballs

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs. We can divide the total number of snowballs needed by the number of snowballs he can make in an hour:

60 snowballs ÷ 16 snowballs/hour = 3.75 hours

So, it will take Jay 3.75 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2.

So, Jim's age at that time was 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Since the question doesn't specify any change in their ages after the Digimon came out, we can assume Jim is still 14 years old now.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate together, we add up the slices each of them ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the usage and ordering of bandages day by day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

However, the question states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there's a discrepancy. Let's recheck the usage and ordering:

- They had 22 bandages at the end of the second day.
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages at the end of the third day.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a different interpretation needed. But based on the given information and the calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

So, the final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she had 2 inches cut off. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times $30/\text{inch} = $60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So the total cost is:

\[ $60 + $40 = $100 \]

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After that, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.

First, let's calculate the number of people who came in at 10:00, which is 40.

Next, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 * 50 = 150 people came in by evening.

Now, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant:

- Morning: 50 people
- At 10:00: 40 people
- Lunch: 80 people
- By evening: 150 people

Total number of people = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.
She bought twice the amount of black pens, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.
Each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.
In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.
The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per scotch bottle} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Now, let's find out the cost of one bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so:

\[ \text{Cost per cognac bottle} = \$60 + (0.5 \times \$60) = \$60 + \$30 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spends on everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which means he planted 40 + (40 * 1/4) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we add the trees planted on each day:

First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total trees planted: 60 + 80 = 140 trees

The final numerical answer is 140."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the losses and then divide it by the number of people who showed up for the party.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- After the children drank 4 gallons, the cooler had 24 - 4 = 20 gallons left.
- After Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, the cooler had 20 - 7 = 13 gallons left.
- After Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, the cooler had 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, so the root beer was shared equally among them. Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink is 8 gallons divided by 3 people.

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons

8/3 gallons is approximately 2.67 gallons.

So, the final numerical answer is 8/3 gallons."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We are given the equation: 
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate the term with the number of coffee mugs. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to find the number of coffee mugs:
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ \text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 42 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so now Amy has only one palette with four colors. That means she has \(4\) colors from the palette left.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of that would be \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, she has \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors left from that set.

Now, let's add the remaining colors from the palette and the makeup set:

- From the palette: \(4\) colors
- From the makeup set: \(3\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(4 + 3 = 7\) colors.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, we multiply 60 by 7:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor to the ceiling is. Since the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison himself, we multiply 60 by 3:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find out how high the second floor to the ceiling is, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches high."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 280 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 252 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles the other dogs need to walk and then subtract that from the total average miles per day.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average they need to walk per day is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs, the total miles all dogs need to walk per day is:
3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John got. His house is worth $250,000 and he got a loan worth 40% of that.

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.40 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of that loan he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = 0.60 * $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = $60,000

Now, to find out how much money he had leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

Money leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
Money leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Money leftover = $40,000

So, the final numerical answer is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

The price per kilogram is $0.50, so the total earnings will be:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, the final numerical answer is $64."
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

Next, to find her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, her profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting:

- The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.
- The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes \(1 \times 2 = 2\) liters of water per day.
- The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed during each period:

- For the low setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. So, the total water removed is \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).
- For the medium setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. So, the total water removed is \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).
- For the high setting, Brian ran it for 5 days. So, the total water removed is \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we add up all the water removed during the entire period:

\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300 balloons. By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left, so the number of balloons thrown is 300 - 12 = 288 balloons."
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose. Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \]"
"First, let's find out the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Now, we need to find out the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total payment for 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid over 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:
\[ \text{Amount to be paid in the twelfth month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"
"Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, it would be 5 * 2 = 10 diaper changes per day. Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base that is 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. So the volume of the jar is:

\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar based on the given efficiency. Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we divide the volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean to get the theoretical number of jelly beans that could fit:

\[ \text{Theoretical number of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{.15} = 3600 \]

Now, we know that 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans that fit into the jar based on the theoretical number is:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 3600 \times 0.30 = 1080 \]

Tim's estimate for the number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off his guess was, we subtract his estimate from the actual number of red jelly beans:

\[ \text{Difference} = 1080 - 900 = 180 \]

So, Tim was 180 jelly beans off his guess."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people who entered at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **Number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station**:
   - Total people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
5. **Bus capacity**: 200 people.
6. **Remaining spaces on the bus**: \(200 - 180 = 20\) people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the initial cost of one visit to the museum. The initial cost is $2.

Next, we need to find out the new cost after a 150% increase. A 150% increase means the cost is multiplied by 1.5 (100% + 150% = 250% = 2.5, but since it's an increase, we use 1.5).

So, the new cost per visit is:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

Pauline visited the museum three times a year for 5 years, which means she visited the museum:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ times} \]

After the first 5 years, she continued to visit the museum for 3 more years, which means she visited the museum:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ times} \]

So, the total number of visits over the 8 years is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Since each visit costs $3, the total amount spent is:
\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 7), so there are a total of 10 * 3 = 30 students.
2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
3. To find out how many groups of 8 students we need to have all 30 students try the escape room, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try at once: 30 / 8 = 3.75.
4. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which means we need 4 groups to accommodate all students.
5. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room.

So, it will take 4 groups * 45 minutes per group = 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final numerical answer is 180 minutes."
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each, so the cost for the tables is 4 * $20 = $80.
He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the cost for the roof frames is 2 * $10 = $20.
Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $80 + $20 = $100.
The final numerical answer is 100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, to find out how many pounds of meat he needs for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]

Now, since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed for 5 pounds of meat:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply 35 by 5:

\[ 35 \times 5 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining minutes, which is \(36 - 16 = 20\) minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the 36-minute call:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday and then add 1 inch.

Monday's rain was 2 inches. Twice of Monday's rain is:
2 inches * 2 = 4 inches

Adding 1 inch to this amount gives us the expected rain for Tuesday:
4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

So, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"First, let's figure out the total number of treats needed. Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's say Carly made \( c \) cupcakes. According to the problem, she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she made is \( 3c - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a pedicure without any discounts:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40

Adding these together gives:
- Total without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Subtracting the discount from the total gives:
- Total after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands with 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3:
- Cost of nail art: 10 fingers * $3 per finger = $30

Finally, adding the cost of nail art to the total after discount:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine Susan receives is counted as one magazine, the total number of magazines she gets every year is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ magazines} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"If Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

So, the final answer is 31."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

An 80% increase means the price becomes 180% of the original price. So, we calculate 180% of $40.

\[ 180\% \text{ of } \$40 = \frac{180}{100} \times 40 = 1.8 \times 40 = \$72 \]

So, the price of the toy in December is $72.

Next, we calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

A 50% decrease means the price becomes 50% of the December price. So, we calculate 50% of $72.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } \$72 = \frac{50}{100} \times 72 = 0.5 \times 72 = \$36 \]

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- Standard fee per hour = $80

Next, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- Reduced fee = Standard fee * (1 - 25%)
- Reduced fee = $80 * (1 - 0.25)
- Reduced fee = $80 * 0.75
- Reduced fee = $60

Now, let's calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
- Number of standard lessons = 4
- Total money from standard lessons = Number of standard lessons * Standard fee
- Total money from standard lessons = 4 * $80
- Total money from standard lessons = $320

Next, let's calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
- Number of veteran lessons = 2
- Total money from veteran lessons = Number of veteran lessons * Reduced fee
- Total money from veteran lessons = 2 * $60
- Total money from veteran lessons = $120

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money made for the day:
- Total money for the day = Total money from standard lessons + Total money from veteran lessons
- Total money for the day = $320 + $120
- Total money for the day = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 650

Now, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes:
650 ÷ 9 = 72.2222...

Rounded to two decimal places, the mean score is 72.22.

"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of 20 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left now, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after eating is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"If 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then one quarter of the number of novels she has written this year is 9 novels divided by 3, which equals 3 novels.

Since 3 novels are one quarter of the total, the whole (which is four quarters) would be 3 times 4, which equals 12 novels.

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days and then find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents.

First, let's calculate the distance Michael travels in one day. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, and assuming he travels every day for 24 hours, the distance he travels in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr} = 1200 \text{ km} \]

Now, for 3 days, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

To find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance that Michael has covered is 60%."
"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes used by her brother as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother together gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. Therefore, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used to make the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[ 84 \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total teachers = 82
Sick teachers = 13
Substitute teachers = 9

Teachers at school = Total teachers - Sick teachers + Substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 79 + 9
Teachers at school = 88

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and Gruyere cheese to find the total cost per week:
- Pasta costs $1.00.
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs $6.00.

Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

Total yearly cost = $10.00 (weekly cost) * 52 (weeks in a year) = $520.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $520.00."
"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom, so:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours they work in a day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days/day} \]

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning Time per Day}}{\text{Workday Hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held by one bookcase:

- One bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf.
- The total capacity of one bookcase is \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40 per dozen = $12.00

Next, let's find out how many eggs she bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

5 dozens * 12 eggs per dozen = 60 eggs

Now, Rose plans to sell the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how much she will earn from selling all 60 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, and then multiply by $1.

Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total earnings = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20.00

Finally, to find out Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings.

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's find out the regular price of the beef jerky bag. The regular price is $18.00.

Since there's a $3.00 discount, the price Archie will pay is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we know that the bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total price by the number of sticks:
$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):
$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

So, each stick of jerky will cost Archie 50 cents."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

Now, Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly to pass. The total number of questions in both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ \text{Total questions to pass} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This can be written as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find out the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played each year by her score per game and then by the number of years she has been playing.

She has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years, so the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Her score for every game is 21 points, so the total number of points she has scored is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he added 3 - 1 = 2 marbles to his collection. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 5 + 2 = 7 marbles."
"To solve this, we need to break down the process Jason goes through to sell a car and then scale it up to 15 cars.

1. For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 person to come into the dealership.
2. For every 2 people who come into the dealership, 1 person buys a car.

First, let's find out how many people Jason needs to get into the dealership to sell 15 cars. Since 1 out of every 2 people who come in buys a car, we need 2 people for every car sold. So, for 15 cars, he needs:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ people} \]

Now, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, he gets 1 person to come into the dealership. To get 30 people, we need:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ telephone calls} \]

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for the people) + 16 (for the rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:

Total = 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56.

So, the final numerical answer is 56."
"Mitchell has 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so he has a total of 2 * 55 = 110 chips. If his family has five members and they all get the same number of chips, then each person gets 110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips per person."
"First, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

So, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Also, he saw half as many helmets as footballs, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the helmets, robots, and footballs together: 20 + 10 + 40 = 70.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim works in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the hours by 60:

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Now, we know that Tim spends 15 minutes dealing with each call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a day, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

360 minutes/day / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

To find out how many calls he deals with during a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of days in the week:

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

So, the final numerical answer is 120."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time:
- The difference is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each. So, for these plants, Crista needs 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each. So, for these plants, Crista needs 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
- The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. So, for these plants, Crista needs 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, let's add it all up:
2 cups (for the first group) + 8 cups (for the second group) + 2 cups (for the third group) = 12 cups of water.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of the journey.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time for both parts of the journey to get the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone costs $20.
Each additional phone costs half of the main phone, which is $20 / 2 = $10.
There are four additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.
The final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of doughnuts made daily:**
   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen equals \(10 \times 12 = 120\) doughnuts.

2. **Calculate the daily revenue:**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.
   - So, the revenue from selling 120 doughnuts is \(120 \times 2 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Determine the number of days in June:**
   - June has 30 days.

4. **Calculate the total revenue for June:**
   - If Derrick sells all the doughnuts every day, the total revenue for June is \(240 \times 30 = 7200\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 7200."
"First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 6 batches each day, and each batch contains 7 photos. So, the number of photos she can upload in one day is:

\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To solve this, let's calculate the cost for one week first and then multiply by 5.

For one week:
- Cost for blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00
- Cost for skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, for 5 weeks:
- Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speed is 150 WPM (words per minute), and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. So, his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, to find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people he saw each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of people on each day:
- On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
- On the second day, he saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
- On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people he saw on the rest of the week. The problem states that he saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 4 days left in the week (after the first three days), the total number of people he saw on these days is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).

Now, we sum up the number of people he saw each day to get the total number of people he saw that week:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, let's break down the popping rate of the kernels over the 120 seconds:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels

Total kernels that popped during cooking: \(20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\) kernels.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels.

Adding these to the total from the cooking process, we get:

Total kernels that popped: \(200 + 10 = 210\) kernels.

So, the final numerical answer is 210."
"First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon is equivalent to 4 cups, 4 gallons would be:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ cups/gallon} = 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. So, for 16 cups of lemon juice, he needs:

\[ 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Next, we need to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means he needs an additional 1 cup of lemon juice for the extra gallon. So, the total lemon juice needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 17 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are required to get 17 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 17 cups is:

\[ 17 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 102 \text{ lemons} \]

So, Tim will need 102 lemons."
"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg per German Shepherd = 15 kg of dog food per day

Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg per Bulldog = 6 kg of dog food per day

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both types of dogs:
15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg of dog food per day

To find out how much dog food they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
21 kg per day * 7 days = 147 kg

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

To find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let's denote the number of red blocks as \(R\).

The total number of blocks is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32\]

Now, let's solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks."
"First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west.

He drove at an average speed of 18 mph for 5 hours, so the distance he traveled west is:
\[ \text{Distance west} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east.

He drove at an average speed of 18 mph for 8 hours, so the distance he traveled east is:
\[ \text{Distance east} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the net distance traveled. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
\[ \text{Net distance} = \text{Distance east} - \text{Distance west} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To solve this, let's calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year = $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value at start of second year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year = $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value at start of third year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies in total.
- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \times 2 = 108\) orange candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \div 2 = 27\) yellow candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies that are not pink:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Adding these up gives us the total number of candies that are not pink:

\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

Since the total number of candies is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of non-pink candies from the total:

\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, we know that Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Dallas originally had 21 marbles and dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles left after the drop. Since Dallas and Darla together have all 52 marbles that Mazie gave them, we can find out how many marbles Darla has by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

So, Darla has 35 marbles. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 35."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adult tickets is $12 * 2 = $24.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is $8 * 1 = $8.
- The total cost for the tickets is $24 + $8 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.

Now, let's add the total cost of the tickets and the popcorns:
- The total cost is $32 + $6 = $38.

So, the family pays a total of $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Adding these together gives the total weight:
1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To hang crepe-paper streamers around the fence, James needs to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both their ages, we can calculate the average age. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the average of their ages is 48 years."
"Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.
Total seashells they found together = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.
Out of these, 67 were cracked.
So, the number of good seashells they found together = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.
The final numerical answer is 665."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- Avery needs 3 pieces per person, so for 12 people, she needs 3 * 12 = 36 pieces in total.
- The dinner plates cost $6.00 each, so for 12 dinner plates, she will spend 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.
- The salad plates cost $4.00 each, so for 12 salad plates, she will spend 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.
- The bowls cost $5.00 each, so for 12 bowls, she will spend 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$72.00 (dinner plates) + $48.00 (salad plates) + $60.00 (bowls) = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"First, we need to find out how long Steve took to complete the puzzle. According to the problem, Steve took 10 hours.

Next, we need to calculate how long Anna took. The problem states that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, we first find half of Steve's time:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add 2 hours to this amount to find Anna's total time:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The final numerical answer is:

"Each pig eats 4 pounds twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.
With five pigs, they eat a total of 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed per day.
In a week, which is 7 days, they eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.
If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, then after a week, he will have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left."
"First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

He already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total needed:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs he needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, let's add the money she makes from cupcakes and cookies:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on buying trays.

She buys five trays at $4 each, so:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Frances has left after her expenses:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

Now, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to add up the meals she has already given out and then subtract that number from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute.

Meals given out:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Total meals to distribute = 1,360 meals

Meals left to distribute = Total meals to distribute - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, the final numerical answer is 1,218 meals."
"To solve this, let's convert each type of coin to cents:
- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money James has:
- For the quarters: 1 quarter * 25 cents = 25 cents.
- For the nickels: 2 nickels * 5 cents = 10 cents.
- For the dimes: 7 dimes * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 105."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

We know the ages of the sisters:
- The first sister is 16 years old.
- The second sister is also 16 years old.

So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 16 + 16 = 32 \]

We know the age of one of the brothers is 12 years old. The problem states that this age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, the total age of the brothers is:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Now, we add the total ages of the sisters and the brothers to get the total age of all the siblings:
\[ 32 + 36 = 68 \]

The total age of all the siblings is:
\[ 68 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends on yoga in 4 weeks. That would be 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Finally, let's add the time she spends meditating in 4 weeks. Since she meditates for 30 minutes each day, in 4 weeks (which is 28 days), she would meditate for 30 minutes/day * 28 days = 840 minutes.

So, the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 2040."
"To find out the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the square feet from each type of shirt and then add them together.

For the small shirts:
11 small shirts * 3 square feet per small shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium shirts:
8 medium shirts * 4 square feet per medium shirt = 32 square feet

For the large shirts:
6 large shirts * 6 square feet per large shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add all the square feet together:
33 square feet (from small shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium shirts) + 36 square feet (from large shirts) = 101 square feet

So, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since a dozen is 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate 36 * 0.50 = 18 seeds.

So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds of a small sunflower and a large sunflower together: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The final numerical answer is 90."
"First, we need to find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, we can find Jackie's current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height. To find out how tall she was before summer, we subtract the growth from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - \text{growth} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company produces 5000 bars in one day.
2. The company sells each bar for $2.
3. We need to find out how many bars are produced in two weeks.
4. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 14 days.
5. In 14 days, the company will produce 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70000 bars.
6. If each bar is sold for $2, then the total money received will be 70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000.

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second one at 50% off. So, the second T-shirt costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.

The total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the shoes cost $40 * 0.4 = $16 less.

So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he completes his chores, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18 after 3 weeks of doing his chores.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

So, Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones. Now we subtract the cost of the ice cream from his total money:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Now, Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent. Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen's total spending is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, Lani's total spending is:
\[ 30 + (100 \times 2) = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add Ellen's and Lani's spending together:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent is:
\[ 335 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

For 1 jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price of one jar = $50
- Cost of one jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit for 10 jars:
- Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

- Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, we add up the values:
$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's add up all the expenses Janet has:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the money her parents gave her:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so in a week he earns 15 cars * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Randy initially has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

So, after the early day snack, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

After giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

So, the total number of cookies he has now is:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

Adding them up:
10 + 7 + 6 = 23

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, we need to determine how many toy soldiers are in each half of Matthew's collection. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, he has 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $7 each.

Now, we calculate the total money he would earn from selling the first half at $5 each:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the total money he would earn from selling the second half at $7 each:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

To find the total amount of money he would earn, we add the two amounts together:

\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by 3/4.

Number of students at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

Difference = 4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 6670
Chocolate chip cookies = 1325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they've made is 1325."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered 2 more than the number asked for, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these up: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Igor actually placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to see the difference between the total number of items he should have placed and the total number he actually placed:

31 (should have placed) - 29 (actually placed) = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, we need to find out how many screws are needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second basket, then the second basket has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:
Total money raised = Alexandra's money + Kim's money + Sarah's money + Maryam's money
Total money raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700

Adding these up:
Total money raised = $430 + $750 = $1180
Total money raised = $1180 + $300 = $1480
Total money raised = $1480 + $700 = $2180

So, the total money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine how fast Aaron ran each mile. If Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed in miles per minute:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Since we know her speed, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed because she runs twice as far as Aaron does in the same time. So, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1}{8} \times 2 = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, we need to calculate how much line is needed for the dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3 to find out how much line is needed:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Now, we know he already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:

600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line he already has = 594 feet of line

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate how much they make in one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
- They also order 1 bottle of wine at $5, so that's $5.
- In total, they spend $10 + $5 = $15 per night.

Now, let's calculate how much they make in one night with reservations:

- They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation is for 2 people, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 people.
- Each person gets 2 meals and a bottle of wine, so that's 12 * 2 meals = 24 meals and 12 bottles of wine.
- The cost for 24 meals is 24 * $5 = $120.
- The cost for 12 bottles of wine is 12 * $5 = $60.
- In total, they spend $120 + $60 = $180 per night with reservations.

Now, let's calculate how much they make in one night with reservations and then for a week:

- They make $180 per night with reservations.
- They are open 2 days a week, so they make $180 * 2 = $360 per week.

So, the final numerical answer is $360."
"First, we need to find out the total selling price of all the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
4. James is currently 18 years old, and he is 3 years older than Dora, so he is 3 years older than his sister Dora.

Now, let's find out how old John is now. Since James was 19 when he was born, and James is 18 now, John must be 18 + 1 = 19 years older than James. So, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.

Next, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one minute. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/3 of an orange. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/4 of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each person can peel in one hour (60 minutes).

For Ana:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Ana in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \]

For Jane:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Jane in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \]

Now, we find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane:
\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400 and he gets it at 80% off.

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. So, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80 after the discount.

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the mechanic charges $150 for the installation.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this, let's use a simple algebraic approach. Let's say the number of chickens is \(C\) and the number of cows is \(K\).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[C + K = 20\]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[2C + 4K = 70\]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[C + 2K = 35\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(C + K = 20\)
2. \(C + 2K = 35\)

To find \(C\) and \(K\), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20\]
\[K = 15\]

Now that we know \(K = 15\), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \(C\):
\[C + 15 = 20\]
\[C = 5\]

So, there are 5 chickens."
"First, we need to find out the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total. We divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices."
