"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for selling is calculated as follows:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
  \]

Next, sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber:
\[
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber required is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sells the house for the new value of $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To determine the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total meters James runs in one day (3 sprints).
3. Calculate the total meters James runs in one week (3 days).

Step 1: James runs 60 meters in one sprint.
Step 2: James runs 3 sprints a day, so the total meters he runs in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Step 3: James runs 180 meters in one day, and he runs 3 days a week, so the total meters he runs in one week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. Adding these together gives:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups. Since the total feed required for the day is 60 cups, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 / 2 = 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Adding up all the times:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{475}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}
   \]
   \[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
694"
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Expected growth rate: 2.5%

\[
\text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Expected growth rate: 1.2%

\[
\text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
\[
\text{Profit from jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125
\]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
\[
\text{Profit from electronic gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96
\]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}

"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add her annual teaching earnings and annual coaching earnings to get her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the distance she has already hiked.
3. Calculate the remaining distance.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. Since her average speed should be 4 miles per hour, and she wants to hike a total of 12 miles, the total time \( T \) she wants to spend hiking is:
\[ T = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine the distance she has already hiked. She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in another hour, so the distance she has already hiked is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the speed \( v \) she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 2 hours (since she has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles):
\[ v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink remaining is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[
\text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

The total volume of the mixture after spilling one liter of the orange drink is:

\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( 26 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

The cost of the pants is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

The cost of the shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of:
\[ \$243 \]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

First, let's calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the video games John buys. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. He started with $195 and spent $160 on video games.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after his purchases, so we can verify the remaining money:

\[
35 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total amount spent and the remaining amount match, we can conclude that John has indeed spent $160 on video games and has $5 left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} - 0 \text{ lego sets} = 13 \text{ lego sets}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"To find John's running speed, we first need to determine the total distance he runs in those 3 days and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

John runs 3 days a week, with the first day he runs 3 hours and the other two days he runs half as much, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total distance he runs in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} + 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total time he spends running in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she can travel while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is four times her walking speed, and her running speed is six miles per hour. Since her running speed is six miles per hour, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we can calculate the distance she can walk in four hours:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances she travels while running and walking to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the number of calories you can still consume is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips contains 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can calculate the grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes before the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes purchased.
4. Sum the initial number of Post-it notes and the number of Post-it notes purchased to find the total number in the package.

First, Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after this. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before leaving the store was:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had before leaving the store can also be expressed as:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information provided:
- Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as \( x \). Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3x \) kittens.

Given that Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the house cats:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 12
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

Total number of kittens:

     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
50,000

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140/month * 6 months = $840.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge = $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126/month * 6 months = $756.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she put in 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both package sizes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers (since \(18 \div 3 = 6\)).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers (since \(18 \div 2 = 9\)).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1.00 = 9.00\).

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00\).

"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The original cost of grooming is $100, and the discount is 30%.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 70 \]

So, the final cost of grooming is $70."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \). The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables based on the information given:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement due to his diet.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement means Gerald can now run 10% faster than his original time. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:
\[ \text{Improvement} = 40 \times \frac{10}{100} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we calculate:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the tomatoes must have had twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Twice the volume of 32 ounces is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide 64 by 16.
   - \( 64 \div 16 = 4 \) cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Since the 25 cars remaining on the motorway after the exits are the ones that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has, we get the number of potted plants Mary will remain with:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by all four friends.

First, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times} \]

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times} \]

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
\[ 20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks \(1 + 1 = 2\) glasses of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 4 \text{ glasses} = 24 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

From Monday to Tuesday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, he watched:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Friday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 2 \text{ episodes} \]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2 \times 100 + 15 = 215 \]

However, the question asks for the number of cookies Henry baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, which is 100.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons:

\[ \text{Cashback per gallon} = \$0.20 \]
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after cashback:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
- Average number of fruit roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the entire 80 feet row, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber:
- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total quantities used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120, we can determine how many teaspoons of sugar were used by calculating the fraction of the total that corresponds to the sugar part of the ratio.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
3. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
4. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, then:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we use the same 40% increase:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99076.92."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part of her run:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which means she stamps \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) letters.

This means that out of the 60 letters needing stamps, 20 have been stamped by Jennie. Therefore, there are \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters still needing stamps.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and we know that 20 of these were already stamped by Jennie, the remaining number of stamps must have been added by Jennie herself. This means that the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a Watermelon**: Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. **Cost of an Orange**: An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the fruits Dillon is buying:
- **Total cost for watermelons**: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- **Total cost for peppers**: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- **Total cost for oranges**: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[180 + 300 + 400 = 880\]

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\) dollars."
"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients seen per day.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- Therefore, the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- Therefore, the cost for each patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the profit per patient:
- Profit per patient = Revenue per patient - Cost per patient = $80 - $60 = $20.

Finally, let's calculate the total profit for the hospital:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Therefore, the total profit for the hospital is $20 * 500 = $10,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal gives:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \boxed{29.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could have completed in the given time for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he could complete in 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he could complete in 6 hours is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Now, let's determine how many questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

To find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\)

"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to calculate the number of bees that are in the hive at the end of the first 6 hours, before the last 6 hours. Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave, there are 0 bees in the hive. Then, 15 bees return, so there are 15 bees in the hive. Finally, 60 bees return, so there are 15 + 60 = 75 bees in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, all 30 bees that left will return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

1. For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 5 people came with bicycles, the total cost for the bicycles is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( (x - 20) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6
\]
\[
x - 20 = 18

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days in one week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), the total number of hours he spends in class on these days in one week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, we add the hours spent on the days with 3-hour classes and the days with 4-hour classes to find the total number of hours he spends in class each week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this problem.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape per month and then for 2 months.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month. For 2 months, they need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month. For 2 months, they need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month. For 2 months, they need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the pens:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

For the notebooks:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

For the rim of bond paper:
1 rim of bond paper * $20 per rim = $20

Now, we sum these amounts:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (rim of bond paper) = $34

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is $34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2.

Calculation:
11 + 6 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^n
\]

For 36 months, there are 18 two-month periods:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):
\[
(1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of missed income Jackie would incur if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is:
€991"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can use the information given:

First, calculate twice the amount Ethel has:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, add $2 to this amount to find out how much Jimmy has:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, which is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and the other bird (Sally Four), and then sum these ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's Age**: The same as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's Age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's Age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- The fourth bird (which is not specified but implied to be the same as the other three): 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\)

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( g \). The total revenue is then:
\[ \$10 \times g \]

The total cost is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost is:
\[ (\$3 + \$2) \times g = \$5 \times g \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$25 \]
\[ \$10 \times g - \$5 \times g = \$25 \]
\[ \$5 \times g = \$25 \]
\[ g = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the donation to charity:
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has based on the information provided.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

The total number of crabs the three have together is:

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

Given:
- Total number of students who voted = 80
- Fraction of votes the winner received = \( \frac{3}{4} \)

First, calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old two years ago.

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters (4 laps) relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in time between the second team and the first team is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:

\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"Let's break down the distribution of straw among the rodents:

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let \( r \) be the number of rats. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 6r \).

2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 5h \).

3. **Rabbits**: There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 6r + 5h + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6r + 5h = 140 \]

We need to find the number of rats in each cage, which is \( r \). To do this, we need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy the equation \( 6r + 5h = 140 \).

Let's solve for \( r \) in terms of \( h \):

\[ 6r = 140 - 5h \]
\[ r = \frac{140 - 5h}{6} \]

For \( r \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 5h \) must be divisible by 6. Let's check the values of \( h \) that satisfy this condition:

- If \( h = 4 \):
  \[ 140 - 5 \times 4 = 140 - 20 = 120 \]
  \[ r = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \]

So, \( r = 20 \) and \( h = 4 \) is a solution. This means there are 20 rats and 4 hamsters.

To verify:
- Rats: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \) pieces of straw
- Hamsters: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) pieces of straw
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total: \( 120 + 20 + 20 = 160 \) pieces of straw, which matches the given total.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{20} \)."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the total interest after 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest after 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months is the initial debt plus the total interest:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- Total cost including rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John works for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he works is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly consumption for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week to find the daily consumption.

First, the total weekly consumption for the flock is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we divide the total weekly consumption by 7 to find the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of trees Tom has each year and then apply the percentage of trees that die after 10 years.

1. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

2. **Total increase in trees over 10 years**: Since the net increase is 8 trees per year, over 10 years, the total increase is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. **Total number of trees before any die**: Starting with 50 trees and adding the 80 trees over 10 years, the total number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Number of trees left after the 30% die**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees before they die, which is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday's Prank:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back.
   - The remaining flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors paint these 6 flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos.

3. **Sunday's Addition:**
   - On Sunday morning, 18 more pink flamingos are added to the yard.
   - The total number of flamingos now is \( 6 \text{ (white)} + 12 \text{ (pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 36 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 18 (newly added) + 12 (remaining) = 30.
   - White flamingos: 6.

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.

So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months to find the total number of cards Elaine has now.
\[
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence and he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
For 500 sentences, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the payments from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year = $2100 \times 52 = $109,200.

Additionally, he received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Finally, we add the one-time reward to his total earnings from the raise to get his total year-end earnings:
- Total year-end earnings = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her current scores and then determine what the sixth score must be.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). The average of the six test scores will be:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} \]

We want this average to be 93, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Next, we subtract 440 from both sides:
\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of each candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up. The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding these two weights together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

So, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000.

So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we divide the total cost by 240 to find the cost per cup.

The cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By setting the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other, we get:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this:
If \( S = 8 \), then \( B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \). Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons and the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons. Indeed, 48 is twice 24, which confirms our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers planted:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount.

Amount spent on advertising in the second year = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000\)

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total.

Total amount spent on advertising = Amount spent in the first year + Amount spent in the second year
Total amount spent on advertising = $15000 + $5000 = $20000

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total cost before registration to the total registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
Thus, in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has after using them:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have 5 empty pens left (since he used 25 pens to make 5 new ones). Now, he can use these 5 empty pens to make another new pen:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made and the 1 additional new pen he made from the remaining 5 pens:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{John's candies} = 2R \]

We are given that John has 54 candies:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of $30,000.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Sue's sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem statement that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( c \). Then the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \). According to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so:
\[ c = 15 - 3 = 12 \]
Thus, the number of wolves killed today is:
\[ 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

Finally, the total number of animals killed over the two days is the sum of the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{73} \]"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find the floor he ends up on, we need to calculate \(4 \times 3 + 6\).

First, we multiply 3 by 4:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1.00. Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/dollar bill} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins and dollar bills:
\[
1 \text{ dollar} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. This means that 70% of the original weight remains.

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = \text{Total weight} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30)
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( A \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A = \frac{1}{2} B \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( B = J_a + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has using the information about Andrea:
\[ A = 52 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the information about Jamal:
\[ B = J_a + 4 \]
\[ B = 44 + 4 \]
\[ B = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:
\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = A + \frac{1}{2} B \]
\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 52 + \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 52 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 76 \]

The total number of fruits is the sum of the fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Total fruits Andrea has} + \text{Total fruits Jamal has} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 76 + (J_a + B) \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 76 + (44 + 48) \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 76 + 92 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

First, we find out how many dozens of cookies 66 cookies represent:
\[ \frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5.5 \text{ dozen} \]

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 5.5 dozen cookies:
\[ 5.5 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need:
\[ \boxed{11} \text{ cups of flour} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 towards the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan payment from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the additional windows of one house:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of additional windows in one house is 4 windows.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house:**
   - The total number of windows in one house is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.
   - This is \(6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}\).

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Adding these together gives:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total gives the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

Thus, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 765 \]"

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Lines Sean has to memorize from the solo song: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 54 = \frac{216}{5} = 43.2 \)
   - Since the number of lines must be a whole number, we assume it's 43 lines (as typically partial lines are not considered in memorization).

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene: \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \)
   - Lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \)

\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we can start by understanding the current sum of their ages, which is given as 20. 

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we can calculate the increase in their combined age by adding 10 years to each of their ages. Since there are two individuals, the total increase in their combined age will be:

\[ 10 \text{ years} + 10 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ years} \]

Given that their current combined age is 20 years, adding 20 years to this current sum will give us the sum of their ages in 10 years:

\[ 20 \text{ years} + 20 \text{ years} = 40 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, confirming our solution.

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together gives:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length used by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the total length used by the beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

The can of pop costs 55 cents. Subtracting the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has gives:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. The flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. We can calculate the total number of stars in these rows as follows:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars. To find the number of stars in the remaining rows, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

These remaining 40 stars are in rows of 5 stars each. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the number of remaining stars by 5:

\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, the actual working time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each day:

**First Day Total:**
\[ 100 \text{ (pushups)} + 50 \text{ (squats)} + 20 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 170 \]

**Second Day Total:**
\[ 120 \text{ (pushups)} + 40 \text{ (squats)} + 40 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 200 \]

Finally, the total count of activities for the two days:
\[ 170 + 200 = 370 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 370 \]"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Let's add these up:

\[
15 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend to the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-55}

"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids of the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
- First bidder: $200
- Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum her bids:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $250
- Third bid: $300

Total cost = $200 + $250 + $300 = $750

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into miles driven and bonuses given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: The pages are printed in a specific order: page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages, one on each side of the fold.

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper prints 2 pages.
- Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"First, we calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we have:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the amount of money she has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25, we get:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
15

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Verify the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books sold in the first year is 400.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     400 + 200 + 45 = 645 \text{ books}
     \]
   - However, the total number of books is only 250, so there seems to be a discrepancy. Given the problem constraints, we should assume the total number of books sold is 250, and the numbers provided for the first and second years are correct.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April, given that the company performed very well for the whole month, is:

"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people that is, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since the bakery produces 60 loaves each day and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price for one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price for one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

For two tubs of ice cream:
- Total savings: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings per packet of milk: $0.5

For four packets of milk:
- Total savings: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person grows an extra arm and an extra leg within this period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm is grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg is grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent events, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was:
\[ 46 - 6 = 40 \text{ years old} \]

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Noah's current age is:
\[ 20 + 6 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. So, six years ago, the population of Chile was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \text{ people} \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Thus, the population of Chile now is:
\[ \boxed{120000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up for the party:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He initially had 50 marbles in the store and added 20 marbles from Johanna. Then, his father gave him 8 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost to fill the pool. The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, calculate the total cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of boys in the classroom is 30.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Therefore, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can determine the number of men who left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left the party and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all their pencils, we need to determine the total number of pencils and then divide by the number of pencils each box can hold (which is 8).

The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, so the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 860 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{860}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to understand the exchange rate and the final outcome.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of new records that can be obtained from trading old records. Since each person leaves with 7 new records, the total number of new records is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 7 \text{ new records/person} = 35 \text{ new records} \]

Next, we need to find out how many old records were traded to get these 35 new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is:
\[ 35 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 70 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 70 old records. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required for a 40% increase in charge as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ minutes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the question asks for the time in hours, we convert 120 minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1 off, so the customer earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. 

Rewards earned = $43 / $20 = 2.15

Since rewards can only be in whole numbers, the customer earns 2 rewards (as they can only use whole rewards).

The customer can use these 2 rewards to get $2 off their purchase. However, they also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used 2 rewards, the coupon took 2 * $1 = $2 off the price.

So, the total discount from the rewards and the coupon is $2 + $2 = $4.

The original cost of the shopping trip was $43. After applying the $4 discount, the customer pays:

$43 - $4 = $39

Therefore, the customer paid $39 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

- Total sugar required = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar required = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares. She buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, after the first year, the value of Maria's shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals based on the given information about the pink frog.

1. **Pink Frog Weight**: Given as 50 pounds.
2. **Blue Beetle Weight**: The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad Weight**: The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake Weight**: The pink frog weighs 10 pounds more than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 - 10 = 40\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird Weight**: The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 40 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how much more Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance is:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 310 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies put in the son's lunch box and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ 36 \text{ dollars} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractor sales:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractor sales is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silo sales:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silo sales is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to break down the costs for each category and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Cost per week: $25

Therefore, the total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she had saved.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28, and after buying the toys, he had:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we first need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do for herself and her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: Morgan wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we add up the costs of these activities:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget for the party is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = 90 - 30 = 60 \]

Each friend will get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. The cost for each additional person is the same as the total cost for Morgan and one friend:
\[ \text{Cost per additional person} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

To find out how many additional friends Morgan can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per additional person:
\[ \text{Number of additional friends} = \frac{60}{30} = 2 \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train can only go between services in whole days, we round up to the next whole number, which is 27 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time for the detour, and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is:

\[ 49 \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we first need to find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

First, calculate how many points Sara has:
\[ \text{Sara's points} = 8 \]

Next, determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after already having some points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:

   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]
4. **Total Pairs Sold Before Returns**: Adding the pairs sold on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
   \[
   14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \text{ pairs}
   \]
5. **Returns**: Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total pairs sold:
   \[
   56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To calculate the total hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to consider the hours she practiced on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
- On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which means she had 2 * 1 = 2 hours of practice.

1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \). Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4N \]

The number of functioning pieces of equipment would then be:

\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:

\[ \text{Cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \]

Simplifying the above expression:

\[ \text{Cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day.

Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each day, and the other 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we calculate the total milk from the first group of 15 sheep:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we calculate the total milk from the second group of 15 sheep:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, we add the milk from both groups to find the total milk collected every day:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we determine the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

This means 20 pupils like blue. The remaining pupils are:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining 20 pupils like green:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, 5 pupils like green. The rest of the pupils like yellow. The number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
15
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, which means she washes:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. Her brother then ate 44 of those cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 65 - 44 = 21 cookies."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment by the number of months.

The formula for the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to convert the time into years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 months is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 3650 \times 0.04167 = 152.50 \]

Now, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 = 3802.50 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.50}{5} = 760.50 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.50}\) per month."
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is given as $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:
\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. If he had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then the 12.8 hectares represent the remaining 2/5 of his land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \). According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \) hectares.

To find \( L \), we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( L \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ L = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of these female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the performance is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400. Next, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5, to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since Mr. Yu receives 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. Since they need to ride all 9 rides, buying the ride bracelet is the cheaper option for David.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, Dasha would need to buy 18 tickets. The cost for 18 tickets is \(18 \times 2 = 36\) dollars.

Now, let's compare the costs:
- David's total cost: $30 (for the ride bracelet)
- Dasha's total cost: $36 (for the tickets)

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she is wrapping.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so the total cost for both is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

With a 20% savings on bundling, the cost is reduced by:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's find the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \frac{90 \times 100}{450} = \frac{9000}{450} = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:
\[ 20\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before passing any out is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she had initially:

"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. The bike costs $300, so he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to save to earn $250 is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[ \text{Total sandwiches needed} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

**Total cost:**
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: The number of corns is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis. Since the number of cannolis is now 100, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160
\]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of steps Elliott had planned to take.
2. Determine how many steps he had taken before his jog.
3. Use the information about the remaining steps to find out how many steps he took during his jog.

First, Elliott planned to take 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he took 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school. He then took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Let's denote the number of steps he took during his jog as \( x \).

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken before his jog (including the steps from his walks and the short walk) plus the steps he took during his jog should equal 10,000 steps. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 5000 + 1000 + x = 10000 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6000 + x = 10000 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6000 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 10000 - 6000 \]
\[ x = 4000 \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{4000}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked in June: \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \)

6. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in June: \( 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \)

7. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in both May and June:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months: \( 96000 + 72000 = 168000 \text{ dollars} \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{168000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $6.00, and the cost of the magnets is $0.25 each for 4 magnets, which totals $0.25 * 4 = $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, she would be $11.50 - $10 = -$1.50. Since she cannot have negative money, this means she is $1.50 short of the amount she needs.

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is \boxed{-1.50}."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ candles} \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The fifth day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **The sixth day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the sixth day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

5. **The seventh day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the seventh day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: \( 800 \text{ km} \)
- Next 2 days: \( 240 \text{ km} \)
- Fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \)
- Sixth day: \( 300 \text{ km} \)
- Seventh day: \( 300 \text{ km} \)

Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1640 \text{ km} \).

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \( 1640 \) kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver's position and the comb's position.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of \(10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000\) feet.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

The difference in elevation is \(6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000\) feet.

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$140 = \$212
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{212}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans. Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
from the jogger jeans, and:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's verify the savings. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 from it. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 from it. The total savings are:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
which matches the given information.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ bird feeders} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds that each type of bird feeder attracts. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, and the bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Therefore, the bird feeders Lillian made attract:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds each} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds that will be attracted to all the bird feeders. There are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 bird feeders Lillian made. The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds} \]

The total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds expected to be seen in her garden each day:
\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \text{ birds} \]

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with \( x = 100 \) cards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer prepared 40 hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer needs to provide 40 more hotdogs to satisfy the second hotdog request for each of the 40 guests. However, the caterer only has 40 hotdogs, so he can only provide one hotdog to each guest.

Since there are 40 guests and the caterer can only provide one hotdog per guest, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 40 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this value, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"

\]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]
This 380 cents is 1% of his original $5, which confirms our calculation since 1% of 500 cents is indeed 50 cents, and 500 cents - 50 cents = 450 cents, but we are given that he had 380 cents left, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining money he had was 380 cents, which means he spent:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]
on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]
Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, and 380 cents is exactly 5 candy bars with 25 cents left over (which is not enough to buy another candy bar), we conclude that George bought 5 candy bars.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:
\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. We do this by subtracting the time Bernadette takes to drive from the time Wayne takes to drive:
\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Time for Wayne's drive} - \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 - 16 = -12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since Bernadette needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length from yards to feet and then use the area to find the width. Finally, we will calculate the perimeter.

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of 3 yards is:
     \[
     3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Find the width of the room:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so:
     \[
     360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Solving for the width:
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substituting the length and width:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(100 + 5 = 105\) minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 105 + R = 141 + R\]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[190 + 10 = 200\]

Setting up the equation for James' total time:
\[141 + R = 200\]

Solving for \(R\):
\[R = 200 - 141 = 59\]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{59}

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes long.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 - 24 = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays she can put out is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together with the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the separate purchase over the super ticket. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \$4 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To find the total cost, we perform the multiplication:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment at 60 mph for 2 hours: \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).
- For the second segment at 30 mph for 1 hour: \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\).

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\).

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\).

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all Jenna's jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

The number of yellow cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Adding these together, the total number of shoes gained from Monday to Friday is:
\[10 + 30 + 60 = 100\]

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. After gaining 100 shoes, the total number of shoes he has is:
\[200 + 100 = 300\]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Therefore, the number of shoes he has left on Sunday is:
\[300 - 180 = 120\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since she has 6 jars of sprinkles and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake to use up all 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The cost of the pen is $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 3 \times \text{Cost of the pen} - 1 = 3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both the pen and the piece of paper:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the pen} + \text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula: half the number of carrot sticks plus two extra. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:
\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we calculate the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is the total number of kids in the class minus the number of kids who are allergic to something:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Therefore, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Thus, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Given weight of the 1959 penny
weight_1959_penny = 48  # in grains

# Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny
weight_2010_penny = (3/4) * weight_1959_penny
weight_2010_penny
```
```output
36.0
```
The weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains. Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny} \]

Let's calculate the combined weight.
```python
# Calculate the combined weight
combined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny
combined_weight
```
```output
NameError: name 'weight_1959_penny' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the combined weight directly using the previously determined values.

The weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains, and the weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains. Therefore, the combined weight is:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Recalculating the combined weight directly
combined_weight = 48 + 36
combined_weight

"First, let's determine how many songs Luri currently has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs Gabriel can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Similarly, the number of additional songs Luri can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free,"" so for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid based on the heights of the cheerleaders.

First, let's determine the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 10 cheerleaders, with 9 of them being 64 inches tall and 1 being 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we need to determine the height of the human pyramid. The pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom layer
- 3 girls on the second layer
- 2 girls on the third layer
- 1 girl on the top layer

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls in the pyramid. Since the average height of the cheerleaders is 63.6 inches, we can use this to find the total height of the pyramid:

\[
\text{Total height of the pyramid} = 4 \times 63.6 + 3 \times 63.6 + 2 \times 63.6 + 1 \times 63.6
\]

Factoring out the common term 63.6:

\[
\text{Total height of the pyramid} = 63.6 \times (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 63.6 \times 10 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
\text{Total height of the pyramid in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- Food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

\[

For the two friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the three friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total weekly cost without the bus pass is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

With the weekly bus pass costing $20, the savings per week is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times S_o = 12 \]
\[ 4 \times S_p = 4 \]

We can solve for \( S_o \) and \( S_p \):
\[ S_o = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ S_p = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ S_o + S_p = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{152 \text{ days}} \approx 690.13 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 690 calories."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, the remaining money after buying clothes is:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Therefore, the remaining money after buying CDs is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ 300 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily consumption before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the weekly costs.

**Step 1: Daily consumption before adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

**Step 2: Daily consumption after adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the painters work and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, in one day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much one person can paint in one hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \div 24 \text{ hours per day} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the combined rate of painting is:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{5}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}
\]

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:
\[
48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as previously calculated).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is \(42 + 130 = 172\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, considering the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out in the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we account for the additional hour he worked out in one week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up all the hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, so \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Monthly goal: 72 vlogs

Vlogs still needed: 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we first need to calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \frac{20}{100} \]

Let's calculate the tip:
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Now, we add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount you paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the final amount you ended up paying is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after these additions is \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His amount after spending is \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending $8.
   - His new amount is \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings for the month of April can be calculated as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he needs to save twice this amount, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
\[ 5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = \$4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 6 miles to work one way. Since he walks to work and back home each day, he walks 12 miles per day (6 miles each way). If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 60 miles (12 miles/day * 5 days/week).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- Five notebooks cost \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- Two pens cost \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- One calculator costs \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- One geometry set costs \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$20 - \$2 = \$18

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $1500 in this case), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30% already earned.

Let's calculate the commission for each part:

- Commission on the first $1000: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)
- Commission on the amount over $1000: \(1500 \times 0.30 = 450\)
- Additional commission on the amount over $1000: \(450 \times 0.10 = 45\)

Now, we add all these amounts together to get the total commission:

\[300 + 450 + 45 = 795\]

Therefore, Antonella earned $795 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case contains 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles required for his guests. Bill has 70 guests, and he wants to provide 2 bottles of water per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he currently has from the total number of bottles required:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons that have 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction in cups Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \). If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is a known value, the reduction would be \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Given the problem's context and the need for a numerical answer, we can infer that the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is 4 cups (since Juan's intake is reduced to 4 cups, which is the daily recommendation). Therefore, substituting \( R = 4 \) into the expression:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ \boxed{16} \] cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This gives us the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information provided.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures, we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) during which he buys plastic action figures. The cost of each plastic action figure is $2, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

\[ \text{Total spent on plastic action figures} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining money Peter has is:

\[ \text{Remaining money after plastic action figures} = 50 - 6 = 44 \]

Now, we need to determine how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $44. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{44}{2} = 22 \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter bought wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 22 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. The cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. The cost of the 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. The cost of repairing the 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, calculate the total amount removed from the account over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 8 crayon pieces she can melt together to make one muffin. We do this by dividing the total number of crayon pieces by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \]

This means Kate can make 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the cost of padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2592 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \$11232 \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw and then divide that by the number of days.

From the information given:
- On days one and two, he saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three, he saw 0 birds.
- On days four and five, he saw a total of 120 birds.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

First, we calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:
\[ 50 \text{ (days 1 and 2)} + 0 \text{ (day 3)} + 120 \text{ (days 4 and 5)} + 20 \text{ (day 6)} + 90 \text{ (day 7)} = 280 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):
\[ \frac{280 \text{ birds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 40 \text{ birds/day} \]

So, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result from the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the boy and his brother have together, we first need to determine how many cards the brother has. The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. Therefore, the brother has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has to find the total number of cards they have together:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:
- The actual temperature is 468 degrees.
- The error is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe:
- The error in degrees for 520 degrees is 520 * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees.
- The actual temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Adding the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy initially bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy initially bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:
\[40 + 68 = 108\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{108}

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Assuming Pete uses 1 contact per day, the 180 contacts will last for:
\[ 45 \text{ days} \]

Since the contacts will last for 45 days, the cost per pair of contacts (which is 1 contact per day) is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{45} = 4.00 \]

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{4.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
John also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
Therefore, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories burned from running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Finally, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink:
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
- To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we set up the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
  \]

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we sum the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

- Weight loss over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \times 5 = 6.25\) pounds

For donuts:
- Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
- Weight gain over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \times 5 = 8.75\) pounds

Now, we find the difference in weight:
- Difference in weight: \(8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5\) pounds

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we will calculate the number of attendees based on the invitations and responses.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people.
2. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends, so the number of additional attendees is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them bring their spouses. Since each of these 8 brings a spouse, the number of additional attendees is 8.

Adding these together, the total number of attendees is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms in one day.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days).

First, we find the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain \( \frac{200}{100} \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein per day.

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
- John eats 6 grams of protein per day.
- In a week, he will consume \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

Thus, the total grams of protein John gets per week is 42 grams."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We know that:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 1 nickel = 5 cents
- 1 penny = 1 cent

Colby has:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cents = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours required to travel an additional 2000 miles is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total amount of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Howard spends each day at the arcade.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount he spends over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given time periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first four hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next two hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

Adding the earnings from both periods gives the total earnings:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the total amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of butter Juan will need is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and Monica's street is 150 meters long. Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is:

\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost is:

\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:

\[ \boxed{65760} \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Additional Funding:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means the total research period is:
   \[
   5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   The first 5 months of the additional funding are the same as the initial funding, which is $100,000.

   For the remaining 45 months (since 50 - 5 = 45), the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000 per month. Therefore, the additional funding per month is:
   \[
   100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]
   The total additional funding for the remaining 45 months is:
   \[
   150,000 \times 45 = 6,750,000
   \]

3. **Total Funding:**
   Adding the initial funding and the additional funding gives:
   \[
   100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{6850000}

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so the total weight of the beef tips is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.
- Therefore, the amount of meat sold per day is \( 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, we know the total amount of meat from the bull is 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell this amount, we divide the total weight of the meat by the amount sold per day:
- Total meat from the bull: 750 kg.
- Meat sold per day: 150 kg/day.
- Number of days required: \( \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \).

"To find out how many students were in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine how many of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with step 1:
The total number of seats in the auditorium is \(4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats/row} = 72 \text{ seats}\).

For step 2:
One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so the number of seats occupied by the administrators is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

For step 3:
The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is \(72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}\).

For step 4:
One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

For step 5:
The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated, which is \(54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}\).

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

2. Determine the price of the silver jewel.
3. Sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

First, we know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of the gold jewel is:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, the price of the silver jewel is:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels to find the total price:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the gap completely, we divide the initial gap by the rate at which Tom is closing it:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Gap}}{\text{Closing Rate}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we find the total weekly production by adding the number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can find out how far Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a single apple and a single orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

First, calculate \( 6 \times 4 \):

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by 3:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Calculate the total time:

\[ 72 \times 3 = 216 \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is 216 seconds."

The total cost of Bill's new truck is **$43,500**."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the promotion, we need to consider both the raise and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \).

So, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is:
- \( 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( 20000 \times 0.5 = 10000 \).

So, Tim's total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- \( 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
- \( 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
372000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
- Cost of each dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Total cost for dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is $10800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily averages and the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day. Similarly, for 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

To find the total number of articles published by both websites together in February, we add the two totals:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila took advantage of a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month was $800.

Next, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Sales for the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount she made in two months by adding the sales from both months:

\[ \text{Total sales for two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. Each sheep and each goose has one head, so the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and there are 7 days in a week, he will need:

\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount of money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days based on the information provided.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the last eight days were neutral. This means that the first eight days accounted for 8 good days, and the last eight days accounted for 0 good days. Therefore, the number of good days in the middle eight days is:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

So, the total number of good days is confirmed to be 12. Now, we need to account for the next three days: the first of these is good, the second is neutral, and the third is good. This means that the next three days add 2 more good days to the total. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys, James sees that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, and now there are 8 dogs, which is indeed twice as many. So, he needs to buy more toys for the new dogs.

\[ \text{New number of dogs} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of new dogs} = 8 - 4 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Toys needed for 4 new dogs} = 4 \]

So far, James has bought 4 toys for the 8 new dogs, and he needs to buy 4 more toys for the 4 new dogs. This totals to:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Finally, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, he does not need to buy any more toys.

\[ \text{Total toys needed} = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = 80 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. We'll use minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in each mode:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets is 6, we can find the age of the twin:
\[ T = Tr + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months. Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]
So, in ten years, Neil has saved:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the total number of coins they have together:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

3 boxes of 5 fireworks each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

Now, we need to determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in the display. Since she can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we calculate 40% of the total fireworks:

\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard to the fireworks she sees in the display:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of \$200 on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2.

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
- Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."

The cost of 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00, so with the deal, she can buy:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \text{ sets of 3 scoops} \]

Since each set of 3 scoops includes 2 scoops that she pays for, the total number of scoops she can buy is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each person eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James incurred from the cost at the store:

First, let's determine the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate when arms are at her sides: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes with her arms at her sides):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's determine the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{87}

\]

Each person, including Greg, gets $5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A received 20% of the votes, we can calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

Votes for candidate B = Votes for candidate A + 50% of Votes for candidate A
Votes for candidate B = 20% of 100 + 0.5 * 20% of 100
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 0.5 * 20
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10
Votes for candidate B = 30

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Votes for candidate A - Votes for candidate B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 20 - 30
Votes for candidate C = 50

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, the amount of water left is:
\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Steven has:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, the difference in the number of books Clara has compared to Alice is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the overall total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play video games or play music**: The rest of the students.

First, we calculate the number of students who like to play video games or play music:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Next, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music:
\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) birds. So, the number of birds remaining in the backyard after scaring away 4 birds is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \) birds.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Melissa has 7 days in a week to complete this grooming. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

\[ \text{Animals groomed per day} = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- The savings are \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

Thus, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, we can find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 54 students each is not possible. Therefore, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form groups of equal size.

To find the number of groups needed to form groups of equal size, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students with each group having the same number of students. This number is the smallest divisor of 54 that is greater than 1 (since 1 group is not practical for an activity).

The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.

The smallest number of groups greater than 1 is 2. If we form 2 groups, each group will have:
\[ \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ students} \]

Since the problem states that the activity is currently divided into 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 2 groups.

The current number of groups is 6, and we need 2 groups. The number of additional groups needed is:
\[ 2 - 6 = -4 \]

Since we need to form 2 groups and we already have 6 groups, we need to form 4 more groups to reduce the number of groups from 6 to 2.

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{107}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \).

We know that the number of Pomeranian girls is 6. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books, and he decided to read 150 more:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed and Ezra have read to find the total number of books read by both of them:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ 600 \]"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day based on the given conditions.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings for the two days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of:

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents by the end of the day.

Total vanilla scents sold = 5
Total fruity scents sold = 2

Now, we find the difference:
Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 5 - 2
Difference = 3

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

The final numerical answer is: 3"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars per ear of corn} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time she spends playing video games. She plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time after reading:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on video games and reading from the total available time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider both the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series. So, the number of series movies is \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \).
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. So, the number of older movies is \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older movies. So, the number of these movies is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost of the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost of the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost of the other movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
Thus, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ 300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the points each of them earns based on the given conditions.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4) \]

Emma's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = [10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4)] - [10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T] \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \times E + 80 + 5 \times B + 15 + 30 \times T + 120 - 10 \times E - 5 \times B - 30 \times T \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 + 15 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3
   - Number of normal days = 3
   - Total rides on normal days = 3 rides/day * 3 days = 9 rides

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 3 * 2 = 6 rides
   - Number of special days = 2
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on normal days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 9 rides + 12 rides = 21 rides

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( w + o = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of white fish in the pond becomes \( 4 + w \) and the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( w + o = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( w + o = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):
\[ o = 17 - w \]

Substitute this expression for \( o \) into the second equation:
\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 17 - w \):
\[ o = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem. After adding 4 white and 13 orange fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) and the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \). Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

The number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35. Additionally, she spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10.00. To find the sale price of the jeans, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00 bill:

\[ \text{Money Left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"
"To find the total time Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they plan to sing it twice, so the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they plan to sing it once, so the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
\[ 240 \text{ seconds} \]

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initially, Billy's hourly wage is $10.
- After 2 months, his wage increases by $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.
- On his first anniversary, his wage increases by another $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (24 hours), his wage is $10 per hour.
- For the remaining 4 hours, his wage is $11.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Billy = (24 hours * $10/hour) + (4 hours * $11.50/hour) = $240 + $46 = $286.

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
- Sally's wage is $10.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Sally = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $286 - $210 = $76.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{76}

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives us the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)

Total number of students tested: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is: \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%

"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more candies he needs to sell to have all 200 sold, we subtract the number of candies he already has from the total he ordered and wants to sell, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:
\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which is 5 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which is 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which is 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which is 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil Tanya uses is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Shipping cost} + \text{Cost of the book} = \$3.00 + 32 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production**: 8,000 bars
2. **Second Week Production**: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third Week Production**: Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, we sum the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14,000 \]"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 1128 minutes."

First, let's calculate the cost of the additional mirrors and chandeliers:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers.
- The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The cost for the additional mirrors is:
\[ 6 \text{ mirrors} \times \$15.00/\text{mirror} = \$90.00 \]

The cost for the additional chandeliers is:
\[ 2 \text{ chandeliers} \times \$15.00/\text{chandelier} = \$30.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for the additional mirrors and chandeliers:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
- The time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway as \( t = 18 \) hours.

The distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t' \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Using the distance formula again:
\[ D = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times 4 \times t' \]
\[ v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times 4 \times t' \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ v \times 18 = 2v \times t' \]
\[ 18 = 2t' \]
\[ t' = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ t' = 9 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to cross the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has.
3. Use the information about the remaining amount needed to find out how much she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has:
- She has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
- Her mom agrees to give her $80.
- She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

So, the total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ 150 + 80 + 50 = 300 \]

Since the final price of the laptop is $400 and she needs an extra $50, the amount of money she has in her purse must be:

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, the total number of students good at math (which includes those who are good at both math and English) is:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of food after applying the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- The discount for each basket of red food is $2.
- Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:

"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + T + M = 87 \).

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, substituting the expressions for \( S \), \( B \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation, we get:
\[ S + B + (S - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B = 90. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S + 2B = 45. \]
From the first relationship \( S = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B - 3 = 45. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 3B = 48. \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 16. \]
Now, substituting \( B = 16 \) back into the equation \( S = B - 3 \):
\[ S = 16 - 3 = 13. \]
So, my age is \( 13 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river day by day.

1. On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, on the second day, the amount of water is \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons.
3. On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount on the second day. Therefore, on the third day, the amount of water is \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is \(\boxed{14000}\) gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In a year (12 months), Claire earns \(12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire takes 1 month to earn 1 badge, Amber takes \(2\) months to earn 1 badge.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge per month.
   - In a year, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Claire earns 12 badges in a year, so Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

- The number of red cars is given as 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
  \]
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
  \]

Now, let's sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, we need to determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots, which weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. Since one box makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we first need to calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt she consumes each day.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

So, the total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods each day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and she mowed his lawn once, we can assume she mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate how many times she mowed Kamala's lawn. According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.

Then, we calculate how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. The problem states that she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns. She earned $6 from Joe's lawn, $6 from Kamala's lawn, and $6 from Alba's lawn. Therefore, her total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 \]

Tasha's total earnings for the month were $80. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 18 = 62 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{62} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ rentals/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 1."
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[28 - 13 = 15\]

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we first need to understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining number of child's bowls is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Since there are two children and each child will have one bowl of soup, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup 3 times. The final numerical answer is:

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. Therefore, Adam's current age is:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups by dividing the total miles driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem day by day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. Since she has 27 cups and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since she divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row is:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up per trip as \( x \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2 \times 4x = 24 \]
This equation accounts for the fact that he makes 2 trips in 8 hours (since 8 hours is twice the 4 hours it takes for one trip).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 8x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{8} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 3.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this amount from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each mini pastry as follows:

- For a mini cinnamon roll: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- For a mini blueberry muffin: \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:

- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \).
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \).

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer:

- Total calories: \( 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \).

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs per day. Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed \(78 + 78 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300\]

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys she has for her nephew.

The total number of toys Sophie already has is:
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals
- 9 stacking rings

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys for her nephew is 62. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already has from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff, so the total donation is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding the donated boxes to the already owned boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}

"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. Therefore, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from selling each machine's output:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in earnings: $259200 - $194400 = $64800

The final numerical answer is $64800."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour option) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The additional hours beyond the initial 12 hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours.
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 17-hour option from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ 178.75 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he loses the $40 from selling the CDs, but he also loses the $15 per CD for the 5 CDs he doesn't like. The total loss from the 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money James is out is the sum of the money he lost from the discounted price and the money he lost from selling the 5 CDs:
\[ 90 + 75 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{165} \]"

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission for 6 copies of the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission for 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

"To find Leo's age, we can start by determining Marcus's age since we know Deanna's age and the relationship between Deanna and Marcus.

Given:
- Deanna is 26 years old.
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.

First, calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Leo's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Substitute Marcus's age into the equation:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To solve for Leo's age, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
From \( B = D + 10 \), we can substitute \( B \) from the first equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he worked in minutes.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports per interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1800 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On that particular day, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. Additionally, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time she was not sleeping on her bed that day is the time she woke up early plus the time she sleepwalked:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting this from her total sleep time gives us the time she slept on her bed:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ 452 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract these 6 spoons from the original 16 spoons:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining number of measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted over the course of 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These three emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. Kelly states that this number is 20% too high. Therefore, we need to find 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

First, calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.2 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Now, subtract this value from the reported number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically such problems assume whole people, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use that information to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day:
   \[
   10 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day:
   \[
   10 \text{ holes} + 13 \text{ holes} = 23 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in the two holes:
   \[
   23 \text{ holes} - 2 \text{ holes} = 21 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. According to the problem, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 \text{ holes} = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

5. Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   21 \text{ holes} + x \text{ holes} = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 40 \text{ holes} - 21 \text{ holes} = 19 \text{ holes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 147 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. **Determine the number of episodes**: There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.
3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: If each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southerly and northerly directions separately and then sum these distances.

1. **Southerly Flight:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Northerly Flight:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Final Southerly Flight:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southerly direction:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{410} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his dad will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that in 5 years, Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]

Solving for \(B\):
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sauteing are independent, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time taken for each task:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -2 degrees
   - Total change: \(3 \text{ hours} \times -2 \text{ degrees/hour} = -6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -3 degrees
   - Total change: \(4 \text{ hours} \times -3 \text{ degrees/hour} = -12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: +2 degrees
   - Total change: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = +4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
\[
-6 \text{ degrees} + (-12 \text{ degrees}) + 4 \text{ degrees} = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Thus, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time at 90 years old.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is the orbital period of Comet Halley, which is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks separately.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias's howl duration:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

Next, we sum the howl durations of all three wolves:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

Finally, we convert the total duration from seconds to minutes:
\[
120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. The friend is going to give Walter $200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount collected after the friend's contribution:
- Total collected so far: $2000
- Contribution from friend: $200

Total amount collected: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to calculate the total donations excluding the lawyer's contribution. Let's denote the total donations excluding the lawyer's contribution as \( D \).

The lawyer's contribution will be \( 3D \).

The total amount collected is the sum of the donations excluding the lawyer's contribution and the lawyer's contribution:
\[ D + 3D = 2200 \]
\[ 4D = 2200 \]
\[ D = \frac{2200}{4} \]
\[ D = 550 \]

The lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3D = 3 \times 550 = 1650 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \(\boxed{1650}\)."

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on inpatients is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatients and appointments into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time spent on inpatients in hours is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent on appointments in hours is:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent at the clinic (9 hours) to the time spent on inpatients (3 hours) and appointments (5 hours), we get the total time spent:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Since Doctor Jones is working for 24 hours in a day, the time he will have left to update his records is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 17 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
- The difference is \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

Substituting the volume in cubic feet:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = G \times 0.10 \]

Substituting the volume in gallons:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Now, let's determine the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we determine the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- The total amount of water already pumped is 12000 gallons.
- Therefore, the remaining amount of water needed is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled to fit the given final charge. Since the equation holds true with the given values, the initial charge \( C \) is:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:
$0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are distributed equally among 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). So, 30 new guests checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial guests: 100
- After early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- After late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- After new guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- After additional guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked on each day.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked on each day:
\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
- Number of average questions: \( \frac{60 - 24}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
- Number of difficult questions: \( 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Total correct questions: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from the cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the cupcakes. Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from the cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total earnings from both the cookies and the cupcakes:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so the total amount she gave away is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves working for 30 days.

1. A dwarf with a bare hands can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine twice as much as a bare hands dwarf, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
3. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days.

- Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
- Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.
- Over 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

The final numerical answer is 43200."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find the cost of the third package by multiplying the cost per sandwich by the number of sandwiches:
\[
1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. She initially had 8 blue balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \text{ balloons} \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\) or 25%

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(0.50 \times (1 - 0.40) = 0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30\) or 30%
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus convincing the teacher: \(0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06\) or 6%

3. **Total Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher and collecting the homework: 25%
   - Probability of having the normal teacher and not collecting the homework: \(0.30 + 0.06 = 0.36\) or 36%
   - Therefore, the total probability of not having to turn in the homework: \(0.25 + 0.36 = 0.61\) or 61%

4. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - The probability of having to turn in the homework is the complement of the probability of not having to turn it in: \(1 - 0.61 = 0.39\) or 39%

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 39%."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh to the eighth), he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out:
- Jim took out $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During college, Jim's income is tripled, so he earns $75,000 per year.
- Total income during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the income he earned during college:
- Income lost = Total income if he had not gone to college - Total income during college.
- Income lost = $100,000 - $300,000 = -$200,000.

Since the income lost is negative, it means Jim actually gained $200,000 in terms of income by going to college. Now, we need to calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $200,000 in loans and the $200,000 in income he lost.

The total amount Jim needs to earn back is:
- Total amount to earn back = $200,000 (loan amount) + $200,000 (income lost) = $400,000.

If Jim earns $75,000 per year during college, we need to find out how many years it will take to earn $400,000:
- Number of years = Total amount to earn back / Annual income during college.
- Number of years = $400,000 / $75,000 = 5.3333.

Since Jim cannot work for a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number:
- Number of years = 6.

Therefore, it would take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, Wednesday's delivery is:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ 736 \]"

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.50 = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.

Finally, to find the average amount lost per race:
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races.
- Average amount lost per race = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then by the number of people per city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities per country = 5
Number of people per city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Number of people per city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population.
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000 = 130,000

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, each painter put in \(\boxed{1.96875}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price for each year:

- **2008**: Price = $20,000 * 0.79
- **2009**: Price = (Price in 2008) * 0.79
- **2010**: Price = (Price in 2009) * 0.79

Now, let's perform the calculations:

- Price in 2008 = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800
- Price in 2009 = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,442
- Price in 2010 = $12,442 * 0.79 = $9,752.98

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,752.98."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - \text{Number of English books} - \text{Number of German books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already traveled. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already traveled from the total distance.

\[ \text{Distance remaining} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already traveled} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that into gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups into gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups per gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train accordingly.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people disembark:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but with a $2 off coupon, they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost and then find the annual cost.

The normal monthly cost of the insurance is $120. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the increased amount as follows:
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, the amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch each weekend and then multiply by 4.

First, let's find out how many movies they watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies on Sunday} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend. This is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies per weekend} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 / 2 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

This means that James does not respond to 16 emails a day. Therefore, the number of emails he does respond to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = \text{Pizzas left with glee club} + \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change Jenny receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 45 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, then in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we start with the information given:

- Binkie's score is 90.
- Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = $250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = $32,500 \)
- Earnings from BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = $11,250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = $67,500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = \( 32,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = $111,250 \)

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, the net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ 12 \]

"To determine how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Total periods = 6 + 2 = 8 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Total time per day = 8 periods * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Total time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes * (1/16) = 100 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning each week:**
   - Total learning time = Time spent in class per week + Extra learning time per week.
   - Total learning time = 1600 minutes + 100 minutes = 1700 minutes.

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, the east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The friend can choose any one of the 6 unshaken sodas or any one of the 2 shaken sodas. The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{33.33\%}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of boys, and this percentage is equal to 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% are girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

There are 3 women wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of all heels is:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of 6 heels (3 of each height):
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

The average height of the heels is:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike and then find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to meet her goal.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. The number of miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time is:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike per day from the number of miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much apples each person wants and then subtract that from the total amount of apples.

First, let's find out how much apples Pierre wants:
- Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples.
- A quarter of 12 kg is calculated as \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) kg.

Next, let's find out how much apples Paul wants:
- Paul wants a third of the total 12 kg of apples.
- A third of 12 kg is calculated as \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) kg.

Now, let's add up the amounts of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
- Pierre wants 3 kg.
- Paul wants 4 kg.
- Together, they want \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) kg.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want from the original 12 kg:
- \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) kg.

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we start with the initial amount of money Raymond had, which is $21.

He then saved $11 from his allowance. So, we add this to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book. We subtract this amount from his current total:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, he spent $19 on a puzzle. We subtract this amount from his current total:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and each book cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book by \( x \). Therefore, the total cost for the 2 books is:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we first calculate 20% of last year's enrollment and then add that to last year's total.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Adding this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, we calculate the distance for a one-way trip:
- John drives at a speed of 70 mph.
- It takes him 2 hours to drive one way.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For one-way distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John makes a round trip, we need to double this distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round-trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total Distance}_{\text{monthly}} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:
\[ 560 \, \text{miles} \]"
"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian will in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian walks in 7 days} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian walks in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in 10 hours is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, which means Kris received 17 stickers in total (since \( 9 + 7 = 17 \)). Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 17 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

So, Seth originally had 68 stickers. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&M in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M's. Therefore, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know from the problem that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes gives us the combined weight:

\[ \text{Total combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total combined weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total combined weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these 80 planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 10 minutes, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ 28 \, \text{dollars} \div 4 \, \text{dollars/week} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk at a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average formula:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that this mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the discounted total cost is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell receives with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, calculate 3 less than 6:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84
\]

Adam initially invested $100. The loss is the difference between the initial investment and the revenue from selling the rocks.

\[
\text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and the land sold in the second transaction was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.

"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4(Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:
\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Next, solve for \( Y \):
\[ 6Y = 37 + 35 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

The yellow paint, \( Y \), is half the mural, so \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paints:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ x + x + x + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 6 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that each day she sees double the number of clouds as the previous day.

- **Monday**: 3 puffs
- **Tuesday**: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs
- **Wednesday**: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs
- **Thursday**: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs
- **Friday**: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from all five days:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, which means each pod in the special size box costs:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams: \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using the chalk at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started as a 5-inch piece, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]
This means the teacher has:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk left at the end of Monday.

Next, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day if he uses only 20% of the chalk. The teacher will use:
\[ 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk each day.

To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before he has to recycle it, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used per day:
\[ \frac{2.75}{0.55} = 5 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, let's determine the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students on varsity} \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist caps. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since the dentist drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage is calculated by the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, we calculate the amount of milk that was returned:

\[
\text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the milk was sold at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old. Checking the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\$500}{100 \text{ books}} = \$5 \text{ per book} \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$27000}{\$5 \text{ per book}} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob distributes the $27,000 equally among 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can buy for each school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 18 snowballs.

To find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes, we subtract the melted ones from the ones he builds:
\[ 20 \text{ (built)} - 2 \text{ (melted)} = 18 \text{ (effective)} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs. Since he makes 18 effective snowballs every 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of intervals needed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ (target)} - 0 \text{ (initial)}}{18 \text{ (effective per 15 minutes)}} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

Since he can't have a fraction of an interval, we round up to the next whole number, which means he needs 4 full 15-minute intervals to have at least 60 snowballs.

Now, we calculate the total time:
\[ 4 \text{ intervals} \times 15 \text{ minutes per interval} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Jay 60 minutes to have at least 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is:

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or an additional constraint not considered. Given the problem constraints and the calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total regular pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week, which totals \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}

"To calculate the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to break down the problem into parts and then sum the totals.

First, let's determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's determine the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors, which means she has:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 180 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles for all four dogs. Finally, we can subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find the miles walked by the last dog.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

The total miles walked by the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average miles walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in one day is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"First, let's determine the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. The price she bought the magazines for is $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is:
\[ 60\% \]"
"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother to make the grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used up 5 times as many grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. Therefore, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used to make the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 79 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 88

The final numerical answer is 88."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly total.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, since the custodian only works 8 hours a day, the percentage cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, the custodian spends 100% of their workday cleaning classrooms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky when it's $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{50 cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Correct answers on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass. The total number of questions for both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct to pass:

\[ \text{Total correct answers needed} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ \text{Correct answers needed on the second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

2. Calculate the total number of points scored.
   - Ara scores 21 points per game.
   - Over 160 games, the total number of points is \( 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \).

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 3 marbles plus the 5 he didn't lose, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 marbles. When he went back home, he found a bead and discarded it, so he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room.
- Therefore, the number of additional flashlights provided for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
- The total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- In the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- In the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- The total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:
- The total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels / 30 seconds = \(\frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = \(\frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(4 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{8}{3} \times 30 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate halves the previous rate.
   - Rate in the final 30 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{4}{3} \times 30 = 40\).

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat.
   - Number of kernels that pop from residual heat = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\).

Now, we sum up the kernels that popped in each interval:
- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- Residual heat: 10 kernels

Total number of kernels that popped:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade:
- Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
- For 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

Next, determine the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, for 4 cups, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Now, consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Since it is twice as tart, it still requires 6 lemons (as the tartness does not affect the amount of juice needed).

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for five pigs over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption for five pigs in one week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumption from the amount ordered:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we determine his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He then ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
- Total cookies: 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final numerical answer is:
23"
"To calculate the total money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would have:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

For the first half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5/\text{toy} = \$30 \]

For the second half of the collection (6 toy soldiers), the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7/\text{toy} = \$42 \]

Adding the earnings from both parts of the collection gives us the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1000
\]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 6670
Chocolate chip cookies = 1325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 1325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine how many eggs are in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and there are 10 eggs in the first basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine the time Aaron took to run his distance:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed in miles per minute.
   - Aaron's speed = \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron's speed is twice as fast as Vanessa's speed.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed = \( \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \div 2 = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run her distance:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Using Vanessa's speed, the time she took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \div \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Currently, he has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total revenue per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total revenue per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total revenue per week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the 56 slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
