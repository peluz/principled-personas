"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells.

First, we know that Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to make muffins. Therefore, the number of eggs she sells is calculated as follows:

\[ 16 \text{ eggs} - 3 \text{ eggs (eaten)} - 4 \text{ eggs (used for muffins)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2 at the farmers' market. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

18"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value of the house gives the new value of the house:

\[ \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000 \]

Josh then sells the house for the new value of $200,000. He initially spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, totaling:

\[ \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:

\[ \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \$70,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

The final numerical answer is:
540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure and the quantity he wants to buy.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide the 16 glasses into 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 divided by 2 equals 8).

The cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

- Seattle: 20 sheep
- Charleston: 80 sheep
- Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total number of sheep = \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\)

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla needs to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

4. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 + 60 = 160\) minutes.

The total load to download the file is 160 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not travel any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he has already spent 3 hours (3 hours initially + 2 hours in traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 1 \, \text{hour} \]

The distance he travels in the remaining 1 hour at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 80 \, \text{miles} = 275 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 275 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 95 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"Eliza's regular hours are 40, and her regular rate is $10 per hour. For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours at a rate of 1.2 times her regular rate. 

First, calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, calculate her overtime rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:
\[ 180 - (180 \times 0.30) = 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \text{ downloads} \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

- Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
- Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type:

- Cost of donuts: 3 dozen * $68 per dozen = $204
- Cost of mini cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = $160
- Cost of mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = $330

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330

Now, let's calculate the sum:

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The final numerical answer is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \]
\[ = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 \]
\[ = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

2. Number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

5. Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the value of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets after the market increases and then find the difference between these values.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[ \text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 + (5000 \times 0.025) = 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[ \text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 + (8000 \times 0.012) = 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]

Now, we find the difference between the value of the electronic gadgets and the jewelry to determine the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = 8096 - 5125 = 2971 \]

Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets over the jewelry is:
\[ 2971 \]"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

First, the train travels 80 miles westward.
Then, the train travels 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35000/year + $22500/year = $57500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, I will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we need to calculate the total time she should take to cover the entire distance.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, we can calculate the total time she should take:
\[ 4 \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining amount of orange drink is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters. The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is \( 9 + 15 = 24 \) liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture:
- The amount of water from the remaining orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.
- The amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

So, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"If Samantha is now 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, then Raymond is currently 31 - 6 = 25 years old. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, which means his son is 25 - 23 = 2 years old. Since Samantha is 31 years old now, Raymond's son was born 31 - 2 = 29 years ago.

The final numerical answer is 29."
"Billy sold 3 DVDs to the first 3 customers, 2 DVDs to each of the next 2 customers, which totals 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs."
"The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, in 4 hours it will melt by:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount paid:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total amount Mishka spent, I will add the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes together.

The cost of the shorts is:
3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50

The cost of the pants is:
3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50

The cost of the shoes is:
3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, I will add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

Therefore, Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then the total cost based on the price per carton.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream. To find out how many cartons she will need, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ 16 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops. 

To calculate this, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it was 15 miles from the 60 miles, totaling 45 miles from the start. Since his first stop was at 20 miles, the distance between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles. However, the question asks for the distance between his first stop and the point before his second stop, which is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles, but since the second stop is 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 from 25, which gives us 35 miles."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total time spent per day is:
0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final numerical answer is 35."

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the question step by step.

1. First, we determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the question, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) jewels. Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. Next, we find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The question states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total points Mike scored are 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

First, Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

The price for 4 yogurts is $5.00. Therefore, the cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

He spends $20 on each of the 8 video games, so the total amount spent on video games is:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. Therefore, the total amount of money he had initially is the sum of the money from selling the lego sets, the money spent on video games, and the money left:
\[ \$195 + \$160 + \$5 = \$360 \]

Since he sold all his lego sets and has no lego sets left, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week, with the first day he runs for 3 hours and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day.

First, let's calculate the time he runs on the other two days:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The second and third days he run for half as much time as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his speed. Speed is defined as the distance divided by the time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk.

Given:
- Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
- Dana can skip at half the speed of running, so her running speed is twice her skipping speed.
- Therefore, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
- Her walking speed is four times her running speed, so her walking speed is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) miles per hour.

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours.

- One-third of the time spent running is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
- Two-thirds of the time spent walking is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

Now, we calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking.

- Distance traveled by running in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles.
- Distance traveled by walking in 4 hours at 24 miles per hour is \(4 \times 24 = 96\) miles.

Finally, we add the distances traveled by running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours.

Total distance = Distance by running + Distance by walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 96 miles = 108 miles.

The final numerical answer is 108 miles."
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since the javelin can be thrown 400 feet without the gemstone, with the gemstone she can throw it 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so the distance outside of the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet. 

The final numerical answer is 200 feet."
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces was:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total costs.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we will first determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then calculate the total hours spent.

1. **Monday:**
   - Number of articles: 5
   - Time spent per article: 4 hours
   - Total hours on Monday: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Number of articles: \(2/5\) times more than Monday
   - Number of articles on Tuesday: \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\)
   - Total hours on Tuesday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Number of articles: Twice the number of articles on Tuesday
   - Number of articles on Wednesday: \(2 \times 7 = 14\)
   - Total hours on Wednesday: \(14 \times 4 = 56\) hours

Now, we sum up the total hours spent over the three days:
- Total hours: \(20 + 28 + 56 = 104\) hours

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. She placed one on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which used up 220 post-it notes. After placing these, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she had before leaving the store and subtract the 23 remaining post-it notes.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ \text{Total post-it notes before leaving the store} = \text{Post-it notes used} + \text{Remaining post-it notes} \]
\[ \text{Total post-it notes before leaving the store} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Since she originally had 80 post-it notes and ended up with 243 post-it notes after purchasing the package, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a day:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen/day} \]

Now, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen/day} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to the destination. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Assuming the distance to the destination is \(D\) miles, the time taken to travel to the destination is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the trip to the destination, the time taken is:

\[ \text{Time to destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

For the return trip, the speed is 6 miles per hour, so the time taken for the return trip is:

\[ \text{Time for return trip} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the question does not provide the distance \(D\), we cannot calculate the exact numerical answer. However, if we assume the distance \(D\) is known, the time for the return trip can be calculated using the formula above."
"Uriah removes 30 comic books from his bag. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To determine the revenue for each day, I will calculate the total charges for the truck and car tires repaired on each day.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, I will subtract the total revenue of the lower revenue day from the higher revenue day.

**Difference in revenue:**
$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(7 + 21 + 12 = 39\)."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag: 28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags."
"Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, which totals $14 per visit to the movies. With $42 available, we can calculate how many times he can go to the movies by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost per visit.

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the extra fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original total of $40.00.
2. Add the 25% delivery fee to the original total.

"To determine the number of good oranges, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ \text{Unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we know the total number of oranges is 25. We can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
\[ \text{Good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - (\text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 17 \]

Thus, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800
Total cost before insurance = $1300

Now, let's calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300
Cost of insurance = $130

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130
Total amount paid = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two different rates of pension payment: the initial rate of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years, and the increased rate of 5% of the pension value after the 20th year.

1. **Initial Pension Rate (Years 1-20):**
   - Annual pension = $50,000
   - Number of years = 20
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

2. **Pension Rate After 20 Years (Years 21-30):**
   - Starting from the 21st year, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension.
   - Value of the pension at the start of the 21st year = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000
   - Annual pension after 20 years = 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, we need to calculate her pension for the last 10 years (Years 21-30) at the increased rate of 5% of the pension value.

3. **Pension for Years 21-30:**
   - Annual pension = 5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000

Now, we sum the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the last 10 years to find her total annual pension after 30 years.

4. **Total Annual Pension After 30 Years:**
   - Pension for Years 1-20 = $1,000,000
   - Pension for Years 21-30 = $50,000 * 10 = $500,000
   - Total annual pension = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $1,500,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the monthly payment for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, the total for the first half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount, so the new monthly charge is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
The total for the second half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the payments from both halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena had paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ 1596 \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total distance she can travel with the full tank of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles and that 4 gallons of gas were used to refill her tank. This means that the car can travel 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Since the tank holds 12 gallons of gas, the total distance Sophia can travel on a full tank is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

2. Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
   \[
   \text{Saturday classes} = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]

3. Total number of classes in one week:
   \[
   \text{Total classes} = \text{Weekday classes} + \text{Saturday classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}
   \]

4. Each class has 15 students.
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Total classes} \times 15 = 33 \times 15 = 495 \text{ students}

$129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises $221."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
\[ \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Step 2: Calculate the interest on the total cost.
The interest rate is 2%.
\[ \text{Interest} = 750 \times \frac{2}{100} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Step 3: Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
\[ \text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Step 4: Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.
\[ \text{Amount to be paid each month} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"To calculate the total amount Artie will make, I will first round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then multiply by the number of pots sold for each type of flower.

Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Now, I will calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, I will add up the total revenue from all the flowers:

Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Artie will make $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

The average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

Since one bag contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required for 180 cups. We do this by dividing the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 2 bags to cover the first 180 days.

Therefore, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[ 2 \, \text{bags} \]"
"If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does:
\[ \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in the better price (packages of 2 for $1 each) is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in the worse price (packages of 3 for $2.50 each) is $15.
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the discount amount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original cost gives:

\[ \text{Cost After Discount} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70."
"Two girls each got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, which means each girl got \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) liters. Therefore, the two girls together got \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) liters of water.

After the two girls got their share, there were \( 24 - 8 = 16 \) liters of water left.

A boy then got 6 liters of water. Subtracting this from the remaining water, we have \( 16 - 6 = 10 \) liters of water left.

The final numerical answer is 10."

"First, let's determine Alex's weight. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

To find Alex's weight:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

   \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. They won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old and has been vacationing since he was 23. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first 11 years of vacations. As he goes on four vacations a year, the number of quilt blocks per year is 4. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks he has is 11 quilt blocks per year * 4 years per vacation * 11 years = 484 quilt blocks."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, let's calculate the duration of each ring and then sum them up.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang four times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's sum up the total number of rings:
- First time: 4 rings
- Second time: 12 rings
- Third time: 6 rings

Total number of rings = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The final numerical answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.
2. Calculate the increase in her salary after five years of service, which is 10% of $600.
3. Add the increase to her initial salary to get her new salary after five years.
4. Since the company policy only applies to those who have stayed for five years, Sylvie's salary will not increase further after the initial five years.

Let's calculate the increase in her salary:
\[ \text{Increase} = 10\% \times 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Now, add this increase to her initial salary:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will remain $660."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, let's determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, 3/4 of the invited friends will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults and then by the children.

An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

A child eats half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Adding the amounts for adults and children gives the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"If Cindy has four pets, Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, which means Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets."
"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James's age = 10

From the information given:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: A = J + 5
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: A = C - 2
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: 10 = C - 1

From the third piece of information, we can find Corey's age:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now, using the second piece of information, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, using the first piece of information, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

With his improved diet, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds and then subtract it from 40 seconds.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"If the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, then the number of cats is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is:

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. The fraction of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \), so the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The fraction of girls in the girl scout is \( \frac{2}{3} \), so the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit.
- 15 minutes have passed, and we need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:

\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

This equation accounts for the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes (\( x \)), the additional 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and the 5 cars that took an exit.

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 15 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."

"To calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we multiply the volume of one box by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Wednesday: 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode, so 1.5 hours in total.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's add up the hours spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1 hour / 0.5 hours per episode = 2 episodes.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). He then realized he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked \( 2x = x + 15 \). This means \( x = 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x - 5 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 5 = 110 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 115 \]
\[ x = 57.5 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cookies Henry meant to bake, and he actually baked twice that amount, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 57.5 = 115 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 115."
"To calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas without cashback
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons of gas
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas after cashback
\[ \text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is \$28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = Width × Length = 2 × 24 = 48 roll-ups

For Marcell:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = Width × Length = 3 × 14 = 42 roll-ups

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both had:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = Beatrice's total + Marcell's total = 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average number of fruit roll-ups = Total number of fruit roll-ups ÷ Number of people = 90 ÷ 2 = 45 roll-ups

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took her to row the entire 64 seconds distance. Since her speed is 1.25 feet per second, the time to row 64 seconds (which is 64 feet) is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{1.25 \text{ feet per second}} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We need to find out how much water the boat took on in 51.2 seconds. First, we need to determine how many 10-foot segments are in 64 feet:

\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet per segment}} = 6.4 \]

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, the total amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 6.4 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson. Therefore, each teacher cleans the whiteboard 2 times a day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   - Therefore, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \( \frac{300}{50} = 6 \) birds.

The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = 100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = 80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = 180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(10 \times 10 = 100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(5 \times 16 = 80\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = 180\).

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 180 - 180 = 0 \]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(0\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total quantity used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio. The number of teaspoons of sugar used is the ratio part for sugar (7) divided by the total ratio parts (20) times the total quantity used (120).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120
\]

Now, let's perform the calculation:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, which means he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is 6 * $60 = $360.

"On the first day, the number of vehicles counted is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 on the second day. Therefore, the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day is:
30 total vehicles - 10 vehicles on the first day = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To determine the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper used per week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper used per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:

"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, which totals to 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Kael brought 10 apples and 4 oranges, totaling 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Together, Morisette and Kael brought 13 + 14 = 27 fruits in total."
"On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day than the previous day. So, on Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and on Wednesday, she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), she slept 1 hour more than the 2 days she slept 2 hours less than Monday. Since she slept 4 hours on Wednesday, she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours each on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept throughout the week:
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours
Wednesday: 4 hours
Thursday: 5 hours
Friday: 5 hours
Saturday: 5 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 33 hours

The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers while running at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the remaining time after the initial 3 hours:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie covers while running at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which means she stamps 60 letters / 3 = 20 letters.

"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia bought as \( x \).

Julia initially had some number of spoons, but after using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. This means before using the spoons, she had \( 12 + 3 = 15 \) spoons.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons she had before setting the table was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \).

Since the 20 spoons included the spoons Julia bought and the 5 spoons her husband gave her, the number of spoons Julia bought is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 15."

"To solve this problem, I will first determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as 15$.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Three times the cost of a pepper.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45\text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: 5 less than the cost of a watermelon.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40\text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying:

- **Total cost for watermelons**: 4 watermelons at 45$ each.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180\text{ dollars}
  \]
- **Total cost for peppers**: 20 peppers at 15$ each.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300\text{ dollars}
  \]
- **Total cost for oranges**: 10 oranges at 40$ each.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400\text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we sum up the total costs for all the fruits:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880\text{ dollars}

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients seen per day.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is:
\[ \text{Revenue per patient} = \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour.
- Therefore, the cost for each patient is:
\[ \text{Cost per patient} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the profit per patient:
\[ \text{Profit per patient} = \text{Revenue per patient} - \text{Cost per patient} = 60 - 200 = -140 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the hospital incurs a loss of $140 per patient. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, the total loss for the day is:
\[ \text{Total loss per day} = 500 \times (-140) = -70000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the hospital makes a loss of $70,000 from these visits. The final numerical answer is:
\[ -70000 \]"

The total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. W = 2B (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. B = 2Q (There are twice as many baby bees as queens)
3. W + B + Q = 700 (The total number of bees is 700)

From the second relationship, we can express B in terms of Q:
B = 2Q

From the first relationship, we can express W in terms of B:
W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q

Now, substituting B and W in terms of Q into the third relationship:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we have the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200
W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, he would play video games for 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours. Since he earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of nonfood items = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 15 dollars * 10% = 15 * 0.10 = 1.5 dollars

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = 15 dollars + 1.5 dollars = 16.5 dollars

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is already given without tax, so we do not need to add tax to these. The total cost of food items is:

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of food items to the final cost of nonfood items to get the total cost:

Total cost = 15 dollars (food items) + 16.5 dollars (nonfood items) = 31.5 dollars

Therefore, the total cost is 31.5 dollars."
"To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses and then subtract them from the total income.

Each client requires:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so the cost for bleach per client is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each, so the cost for cloths per client is $5.

Therefore, the total cost per client is \(4 + 5 = $9\).

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of \(3 + 5 = 8\) clients.

The total expenses for 8 clients will be \(8 \times 9 = $72\).

Given that his total income each week is $92, the profit can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = 92 - 72 = $20 \]

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we can calculate the number of harvests in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- John harvests every 3 months, so the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
- \( 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
- \( 4 \text{ harvests/year} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \).

Thus, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000."
"The first lego set has 500 pieces. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first, which means it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first, which means it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
500 (from the first set) + 1500 (from the second set) + 125 (from the third set) = 2125 pieces.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, twice that number is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive. The total number of bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees. Therefore, in the last 6 hours, all 90 bees return to the hive.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90."
"The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22. Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change received. Thus, the amount of money given to the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30."
"If Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, then Dorothy has \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) friends.

James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) friends.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet because the speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate the earnings, we need to determine the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- The cost for one bicycle is 2 tires * 25 cents per tire = 50 cents.
- For 5 bicycles, the total cost is 5 * 50 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- The cost for one tricycle is 3 tires * 25 cents per tire = 75 cents.
- For 3 tricycles, the total cost is 3 * 75 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle.
- The cost for one unicycle is 1 tire * 25 cents per tire = 25 cents.
- For 1 unicycle, the total cost is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys ten packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains six cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6.00\).

Now, let's determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.00.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00\).

The final numerical answer is:
4.00"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries initially contained 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this purpose.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls every day. Therefore, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants every day. Therefore, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day. Therefore, the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together to get the total length in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

The total number of fish caught by Anakin is:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

So, the total number of fish caught by Anakin is \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\).

The total number of fish caught by Locsin is:
- Starfish: 5
- Sea horses: 3
- Clownfish: 5

So, the total number of fish caught by Locsin is \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\).

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin together is \(19 + 13 = 32\).

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. Therefore, the price after each two-month period is 120% of the previous price.

Let's calculate the price after each two-month period:

1. After the first two months, the price is $20 * 1.20.
2. After the next two months (total 4 months), the price is the new price * 1.20.
3. This process continues until the 36 months.

We can express the price after 36 months as:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical value:
\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Then, multiply by the original price:
\[ 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. Since one red car costs $4, and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can find the cost of one action figure by dividing the cost of the doll by 3. Given that an action figure costs $5, we can verify this:

\[ \text{Cost of one action figure} = \frac{\text{Cost of the doll}}{3} = \frac{3 \times \text{Cost of one action figure}}{3} = \text{Cost of one action figure} \]

Since the cost of one action figure is $5, the cost of the doll is:

\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:

- Cost of red cars: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)
- Cost of action figures: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
- Cost of the doll: \(15\)

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour from doing her taxes herself. If we assume she works 1 hour on her taxes, the missed income is $35. If she works 3 fewer hours of freelance work, she loses $35 * 3 = $105 in missed income.

The accountant charges $90 to do the taxes. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income she would have lost if she did her taxes herself.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 105 - 90 = 15 \]

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

1. Computer: €1090
2. Scanner: €157
3. CD burner: €74
4. Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, the final numerical answer is €77."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Since she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, the number of times she needs to babysit is:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per babysitting}} = 5 \text{ times} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the information given, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, we can find Seth's current age by substituting \( B = 8 \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these five days is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these two days is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday gives us the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, which is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
- Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
- Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to multiply the number of each type of creature by the number of legs they have and then sum these products.

For the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

For the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add these together to get the total number of legs:
640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

The total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"To calculate the amount Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to determine the increased minimum payments for each of her debts.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than the minimum = $300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than the minimum = $200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than the minimum = $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, we sum up the increased minimum payments for all debts to find out how much Jessica pays each month:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1,500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
Total yearly payment = $1,500 * 12 = $18,000

Thus, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year."
"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$10 - \$25 = -\$15 \]

This negative cost indicates that the cost is actually $15, not $25. This means the cost of making the lemonade is $15. The cost of making the lemonade includes the cost of lemons and sugar. Let's denote the cost of lemons as \( L \) and the cost of sugar as \( S \). We know:
\[ L + S = \$15 \]
\[ L = \$3 \]
\[ S = \$2 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ L = \$3 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4W \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5W = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( W \):
\[ 5W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"If Jan is 30 years old, then two years ago Jan was 28 years old.

Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, so Mark was 28 / 2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean was 19 + 2 = 21 years old two years ago.

Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the first team, each runner completes their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times of the two teams:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in their probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, it is 50% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( R \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3R \times 6 = 18R \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18R + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18R + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18R = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18R = 90 \]
\[ R = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ R = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the interest accrued over that period.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is calculated on the new total:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is calculated on the new total:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.1208 after 3 months."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and it is given that the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on each of the 2 rides:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

Therefore, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John works for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he works is:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

He collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Therefore, the amount needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.
6. **Total increase in trees over 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
7. **Total number of trees before any die**: Adding the initial number of trees to the total increase gives \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
8. **Trees that die**: 30% of the trees die after 10 years. Therefore, \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees die.
9. **Number of trees left**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees gives \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Thus, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

3. **Placement on Sunday:**
   - Another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Comparison on Sunday at Noon:**
   - Number of pink flamingos: 30
   - Number of white flamingos: 6
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the crayons is 5 * $2 = $10. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. The change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10."
"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Therefore, the cost of one pen is the sum of the cost of a pencil and an eraser. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the cost of one pen is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

The final numerical answer is 12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children.
1. First, add the number of men and women: 8417 + 9092 = 17509
2. Then, subtract this sum from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we will calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

Now, we sum up the total number of cards collected over the three months:
\[
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings from Publisher A. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate his earnings from Publisher B. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
For 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum his earnings from both publishers to find out how much he makes in a week:
\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of pails he gets every day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total liters of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters."
"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary:
\[ \text{Total weekly salary for the year} = 2100 \times 52 \]

\[ \text{Total yearly salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward from the award:
\[ \text{Total yearly earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ 114200 \]"
"First, I will calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year from the entire farm.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 27."
"Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which totals to 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, which totals to 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, which totals to 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Adding the blue and red pens to the initial count, Janet now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first calculate the sum of her current scores and then determine the required score for the sixth test.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After removing the lowest score, the average of the remaining five scores will be 93. The lowest score among the first five is 71. Therefore, the sum of the remaining four scores (after removing 71) will be:
\[ 440 - 71 = 369 \]

The average of these four scores is 93, so the sum of these four scores is:
\[ 93 \times 4 = 372 \]

Since the sum of the remaining four scores is 369, the score on the sixth test \( x \) must be:
\[ 372 - 369 = 3 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 3 on the sixth test to get an average of 93. However, since test scores are typically whole numbers between 0 and 100, and a score of 3 is not possible, it implies that the average of the remaining four scores (after removing the lowest score) cannot be 93 with the given scores. But based on the mathematical calculation, the score needed is:

\[ x = 3 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.

So, the total kilometers for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \]

For the next three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately. The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding these two weights together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
Each plate costs $6000.

Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, let's find out the total cost of buying each cup. The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000.

Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can calculate the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240.

Cost of one cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

The final numerical answer is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Now, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by her earnings per mowing:
- $60 / $4 = 15.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = R + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected every day can be expressed as:

\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that is the distance he walks. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( t \) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ t = \frac{distance}{speed} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the second day, Sloane counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, I will first calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt, and then divide that total by her hourly wage.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, we need to find the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's points can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus**: It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. **Travel by Car**: It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, it takes \(6 / 2 = 3\) days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
3. **Return Trip by Car**: If Andrew returns from Rochester by car, it will also take 3 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days Andrew will travel:
- Travel by bus: 6 days
- Return trip by car: 3 days

Total travel days = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards. The total number of cards he has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and upgrades:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Now, adding the upgrade for chips and a drink:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. Therefore, the amount he still owes is:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

The final numerical answer is $9.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle and then calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so the time required to complete the puzzle in minutes is 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. Therefore, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

This means the number of watermelons not ready for harvest after the first harvest is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. The number of watermelons ready for harvest at this time is:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car sells for $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the total registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and there are 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"One-third of the penguins jump in the ocean, which means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go to the ocean.

Another one-third go inside the cave, which also means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go to the cave.

So, the total number of penguins that leave to go to the ocean or the cave is \( 12 + 12 = 24 \).

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \( 36 - 24 = 12 \).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he consumes per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
Thus, in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend is to have 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
4. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit B.
5. The remaining students are those who went out through exit C.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of 1000 students.
\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students.
\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

4. The number of students remaining after exit B is:
\[ \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

In total, Dolly and Pandora read 3 + 3 = 6 books collectively."
"Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is 3 * 10 = 30 pages. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, it will take him 30 * 6 = 180 minutes. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Thus, 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final numerical answer is 3 hours."
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the plan's total:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

"Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. After Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After Colby took his share, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries. Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked.

3. Apply the 10% discount.
4. Calculate the final amount paid.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked:
- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs it done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, calculate the total cost before the discount:
- She charges $250 per hour.
- Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, apply the 10% discount:
- The discount is 10% of $30,000.
- Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, calculate the final amount paid:
- Final amount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Jean paid $27,000."

First, calculate the total weight of the onions:
- Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
- The chef bought 4 bags.
- Therefore, the total weight is \( 50 \text{ pounds/bag} \times 4 \text{ bags} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, calculate the total cost:
- The cost per pound is $1.50.
- The total weight is 200 pounds.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \).

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this, let's first determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Her sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Her sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each ate over the two days:
- Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
- The difference is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.

Given that each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we can find the total number of boys in the first and second classes:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ boys} \]

Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 17 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's cougars are 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

5. **Final Total:**
   - Total animals killed: \( 46 \text{ (wolves)} + 27 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \)

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73."

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, let's calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Therefore, Anne went down the slide 70% of 30 times (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 \times 0.70 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

He then divides these 40 new cows equally into the 20 stalls, which means each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Now, each of the 20 stalls has 2 cows from the new purchase, and each stall originally had 20 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows in each stall is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we calculate:
\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 176 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to consider the value of each type of coin and bill.

- Pennies are worth $0.01 each.
- Nickels are worth $0.05 each.
- Dimes are worth $0.10 each.
- Dollar bills are worth $1.00 each.

Now, let's calculate the total value for each type of currency:

- Pennies: \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollars
- Nickels: \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollars
- Dimes: \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollars
- Dollar bills: \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollars

Adding these values together gives the total amount of money:

\(1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00\) dollars

So, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
5600 \text{ pounds}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Each book is $0.50 overdue.
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.

\[ \text{Cost of overdue books} = 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Cost of overdue books} + \text{Flat fee} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Since \( J_a = 44 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Total number of fruits:
\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

The total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the number of cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Given that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies. First, we find out how many dozens of cookies 66 cookies represent:
66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens.

Since 5.5 dozens of cookies require 5.5 times the amount of flour needed for one dozen:
5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
\]

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6,200}{100} = 62
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
62
\]"
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, which totals to 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

"Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400 000 = 0.03 * $400 000 = $12 000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400 000 = 0.05 * $400 000 = $20 000

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee:
Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000

Mr. Tan paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Loan amount
Net proceeds = $400 000 - $32 000 - $250 000 = $118 000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118 000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we add the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 51 \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs together:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

The final numerical answer is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, let's calculate the number of additional windows:
- Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
- Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms to the total number of additional windows:
- Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
- Total windows = 12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Collar and rosette stitches} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the stitches for the body and the sleeves together are:
\[ \text{Body and sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

Thus, each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

For the tomato seeds:
20 packets * $40 per packet = $800

For the celery seeds:
80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

Now, we sum up the lines Sean has to memorize from all parts of his role:
\[
54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines}

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and she uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the length used by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars by 5 to find the number of rows:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour. So, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, let's find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults = 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

Chocolate bars per child = 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for 3 hours in total, but she takes a 30-minute break. Therefore, she works for 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes, so the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes is 150 / 10 = 15. Therefore, she earns 15 * $5 = $75."
"To find the total points after the extra points are distributed, let's first determine the points each player has after the initial 3 rounds.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's check if any of them need the extra point in the fourth round. Since Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, he does not get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is also not over 20, so he does not get an extra point either. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

After the extra point is distributed, the points are:
- Mike: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

The total points after the extra points are distributed is:
\(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\)

The final numerical answer is 82."

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

The total count of activities he does in the two days is:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner), each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

There are 5 members in the household, so the total consumption per day is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold the following number of crates:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Next, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates (Tuesday to Thursday) + 20 crates (weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering the initial bid and the subsequent bids from herself and the other three bidders.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   Carmen's initial bid is $200.

2. **Subsequent Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.
   - Each subsequent bid increases by $50.

Let's denote the number of times Carmen bids as \( n \). Since she bids after each of the 3 other people, \( n = 3 \).

The bids made by Carmen are:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The total amount Carmen bids is the sum of these individual bids:
\[
200 + 250 + 300
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750
\]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen spends to win the antique desk is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus, then scale it up to a yearly amount.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Distance to work one way: 30 miles
- Round trip to work each day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Weeks per year: 50 weeks
- Total miles driven in a year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles driven in a year: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Now, let's calculate the total bonus paid in a year:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Months per year: 12 months
- Total bonus paid in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays in a year:
- Total cost for miles driven: $30000/year
- Total bonus paid: $1800/year
- Total amount paid in a year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year

The final numerical answer is $31800."
"On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes, and on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. Therefore, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday, so he needs to exercise for 39 * 2 = 78 minutes on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Page Arrangement**: In the given arrangement, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. This means that the pages are printed in a specific order on the two layers of the folded paper.

Since each piece of paper is used to print two pages, and there are 32 pages in total, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16."
"Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $25. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had $50 - $25 = $25 left. She then spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the amount left is $25 - $10 = $15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, in the first year, she sold \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - First year: 90 books
   - Current year: 45 books
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold in the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250 books
   - Unsold books: 50 books
   - Books sold in the three years: \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books.

4. **Calculate the number of books sold in the third year:**
   - Total books sold in the three years: 200 books
   - Books sold in the first two years: 135 books
   - Books sold in the third year: \( 200 - 135 = 65 \) books.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Books sold in the second year: 45 books
   - Total money earned in the second year: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 900 dollars."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's determine the number of days Watson works in April. April has 30 days, and he works 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of days he works in April is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours each day and earns $10 per hour. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Since he works 20 days in April, his total earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 20 \text{ days} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$2000 \]

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since he works 4 weeks in April, his total bonus for the month is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$300/\text{week} = \$1200 \]

Adding his total earnings from his hourly wage and his total bonus, we get his total earnings for April:
\[ \$2000 + \$1200 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3200 \]"

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total loaves produced each day:** 60 loaves.

2. **Morning sales:** Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves left after morning sales:** Subtract the morning sales from the total.
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and evening sales:** Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, we can calculate the weight Sandy needs to lose per week.

First, we find out how much Joey loses per week:
\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy needs to lose:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks as follows:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week."
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for the ice cream and the milk when bought at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price for one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price for one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Therefore, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted prices is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum causes an extra arm every three days. Therefore, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum causes an extra leg every five days. Therefore, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits = $600
Cost of suitcases = $150
Cost of flight ticket = $1200
Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, let's find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend on the trip - Total cost of items
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's determine the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, let's determine the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, we add the eggs consumed by both groups to find the total number of eggs consumed per day:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was half of its current population.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let the number of players on the defense be \( D \).

Then, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) and the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we calculate the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people.

Then, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments, which is \(1/4\) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. So, \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Now, we can find out how many people actually showed up for the party by subtracting the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and the number of people with previous commitments from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 8 - 2 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the store that already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, the number of marbles given by his father is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by understanding that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole.

To find the number of poles, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of poles}}{\text{Number of wires}} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Let \( P \) be the number of poles. Then,

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To solve for \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men out of the 40 people who stayed are the ones who did not leave. Therefore, the number of men who left is 40 - 22 = 18 men.

Since 10 people in total left, and 18 men left, the remaining 10 - 18 = 8 men must have left, which is not possible since only 18 men left. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement, but we can proceed with the given numbers.

"A magazine costs half as much as a book, so if a book costs $4, then a magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so a pen costs $2 - $1 = $1. 

The pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's subtract the loose pencils from the total to find out how many pencils are in the boxes:

26 total pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in boxes.

Now, we know that these 24 pencils are divided among three boxes. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we divide the number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:

24 pencils in boxes ÷ 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box.

Now we know that Jam has 8 pencils per box. To find out how many boxes Jam has in total, we divide the total number of pencils she has by the number of pencils per box:

24 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 3 boxes.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes Meg needs, we divide the number of her pencils by the number of pencils that can fit in one box. Since we don't know the capacity of one box, we assume that each box can hold the same number of pencils as Jam's boxes, which is 8 pencils per box:

46 pencils ÷ 8 pencils per box = 5.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means Meg needs 6 boxes to store all her pencils.

Now, to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need together, we add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of boxes Meg needs:

3 boxes (Jam) + 6 boxes (Meg) = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. If the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, the weakening due to the addition of cream is:
\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/15 milliliters} = 12 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream to find the total weakening:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 12 \text{ milliliters} = 857 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 857 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is 7 * 2 = 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

After buying, he has:
8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has:
36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has:
33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, to charge 40 percentage points, the time required is:

40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. If she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left."
"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer earned $1 off for every $20 spent. They spent $80, so the rewards earned are:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards, so the price of the current shopping trip is reduced by $4:
\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the coupon amount from the discounted price:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:
\[ 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

For Job A:
1. Gross pay: $15 per hour for 2000 hours = $15 * 2000 = $30,000
2. State tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
1. Gross pay: $42,000
2. Property tax: $6,000
3. Net pay before property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. State tax on net income: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay rates:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles:
   - 40 percent of 220 castles are ruined.
   - Number of ruined castles = 220 * 0.40

2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Number of unmanned ruined castles = (Number of ruined castles) * 0.50

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Number of ruined castles = 220 * 0.40 = 88
2. Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 * 0.50 = 44

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, I will first calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, to find the cost difference:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to determine the total number of guns. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Adding these together gives us the total number of guns:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people, so if we divide the total number of guns equally among them, each person would have:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we will calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

For the suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, the total sugar required is \( 8 \times 30 \) ounces.

For the fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar required is \( 1 \times 70 \) ounces.

Now, let's calculate these values:
- Sugar for 8 batches of suckers: \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.
- Sugar for 1 batch of fudge: \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Adding these together gives the total amount of sugar needed:
- Total sugar: \( 240 + 70 = 310 \) ounces.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"Initially, Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares at the end of the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares at the end of the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]"

The final numerical answer is 1."
"Let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be \( x \). Then the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

Thus, Josh starts juggling on stage with 4 balls."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of the animals based on the information given:

1. A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June.

First, let's find the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:

\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]"

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies her husband eats:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies put in the son's lunch box and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the original total cost without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the original total cost.

Step 1: The original total cost for 2 shirts is:
\[ 2 \times \$30 = \$60 \]

Step 2: The discount amount is 40% of the original total cost:
\[ 40\% \times \$60 = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24 \]

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the original total cost to find the final amount Davos paid:
\[ \$60 - \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from making silos instead of tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the annual cost for Madeline, we need to first determine the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
- Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $120.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
- Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12
- Annual cost = $120 * 12 = $1440.

Therefore, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, let's break down each activity:

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours

Now, let's sum up the hours:

1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours

The total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"April initially bought 100 plant pots. She needs 30 for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. Therefore, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90. Since she already has 100 plant pots, the number of plant pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on an $11 sweater.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

To find out how much money she saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had.

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
\[ \text{Amount saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities.

1. **Boating Time**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming Time**: He spends half the time boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.
4. **Total Time Spent on Activities**: The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is \( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \) hours.
5. **Total Time Spent**: This 15 hours is 30% of the total time spent on the vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. Then, \( 0.30T = 15 \). Solving for \( T \), we get \( T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \) hours.
6. **Sightseeing Time**: John spends 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is \( 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \) hours.

The time John spent sightseeing is 20 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both jobs to find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs:
\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. Adding the money she will earn from her jobs to her current savings gives:
\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

The total cost of the toys is:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]

Dean initially had $28, so after buying the toys, he has:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so Dean's total money is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mini-golf:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to play one round, so the cost is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the arcade tokens:
- She wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the go-karts:
- The go-karts cost $10 per ride.
- She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the cost is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these activities:
- Cost of mini-golf: $5
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5
- Cost of go-karts: $20
- Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan's total budget is $90. To find out how much money is left after these expenses, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Remaining budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since Morgan is inviting herself and her friends to the party, the remaining budget of $60 will be used for her friends. Each friend will get $5 worth of arcade tokens.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
- Number of friends: $60 / $5 = 12

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party."
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate her daily expenditure on lollipops:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
- She buys 4 lollipops each day.

Daily expenditure on lollipops:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much pocket money she receives each day:
- Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.

Now, we calculate her daily savings by subtracting her daily expenditure from her daily pocket money:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 400 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we find out how much she saves over 5 days:
\[ 400 \text{ cents/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2000 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the final answer to dollars, we know that 100 cents is equivalent to $1:
\[ 2000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \). According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \). The problem also states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as:

\[ C = 2S - 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance at which the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 0.0375 days."
"To determine the amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average of these two amounts is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know that a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing. We need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The stuffing required for the chihuahua beds is:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per chihuahua bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

The stuffing required for the collie beds is:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per collie bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time taken for John's trip to his friend's house.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken for the detour.

The detour added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance 210 miles. He drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \approx 0.143 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time taken for John's return trip.

The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for the return trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2.857 \text{ hours} + 0.143 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5.000 \text{ hours} \]

The total trip took 5 hours."
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of fourth-grade boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test: 15 points
Second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
15 + 18 = 33 points

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Points needed on the third test:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 40."
"Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. Therefore, Sara's points are 8, and Erin's points are 3 times Sara's points, which is 3 * 8 = 24 points. Since Erin scored 14 points after, it means she gained 24 - 14 = 10 points. Thus, Erin had 14 - 10 = 4 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is 4."
"To calculate the total cost, I will break down the expenses as follows:

1. Cost of picture frames for all seniors:
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + ($20 * 20%) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is $24 * 44 = $1056.

2. Cost of pins for 2 seniors:
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - There are 2 seniors receiving pins, so the total cost for the pins is $5 * 2 = $10.

3. Cost of cords for 1/4 of the seniors (which is 11 seniors):
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - There are 11 seniors receiving cords, so the total cost for the cords is $12 * 11 = $132.

Now, I will sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198."
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.
On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

The total number of pairs sold over the weekend is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs.

Six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold after returns is 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50."

Therefore, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

First, let's find the total number of pieces of equipment. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning.

Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).

The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \).

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets 15 sheep contributing 1 kg of milk each and the remaining 15 sheep contributing 2 kg of milk each every day. Therefore, the total milk collected every day is:

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to determine the number of apples she picked on each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide the total amount of money she made by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. A pair of socks consists of 2 socks.

She has washed 10 pairs of socks, which means she has washed:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 15 \]"

So, the final numerical answer is 21."
"To calculate the monthly payment for Karan, we need to use the formula for the monthly payment on a loan, which is given by:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed), which is $3,650.
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12), which is \( \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \).
- \( n \) is the number of payments (or months), which is 5.

First, let's calculate the monthly interest rate \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{0.10}{12} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Next, we calculate \( (1 + r)^n \):

\[ (1 + r)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{120}\right)^5 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 1 + \frac{1}{120} = 1.008333 \]
\[ (1.008333)^5 \approx 1.041633 \]

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times \frac{1}{120} \times 1.041633}{1.041633 - 1} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times \frac{1.041633}{120}}{0.041633} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times 0.008680275}{0.041633} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{31.98145875}{0.041633} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} \approx 769.99 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $770 per month."

\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, so the profit is $18. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the profit per hour that Millie makes running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he retained \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he had left is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

First, we calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):

\[
12.8 \times 5 = 64
\]

Next, we divide 64 by 2:

\[
64 \div 2 = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
x = 32
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[ \text{Female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we first need to determine how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. Since they need to ride all 9 rides, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, Dasha's total cost is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars per ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the total costs for David and Dasha:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's total cost from Dasha's total cost:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Therefore, the total number of gifts is:

6 (family gifts) + 4 (friend gifts) + 2 (teacher gifts) = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has individually.

Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can represent the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can write the equation:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]
\[x = \frac{165}{11}\]
\[x = 15\]

Now we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the savings from bundling.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, so together they cost $20. With a 20% savings on bundling, the savings amount is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \]

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. I will use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percentage:
- Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under both conditions and then find the difference.

1. **Initial Energy Consumption:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
   - Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

2. **Reduced Energy Consumption:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, so he now uses the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - The daily energy consumption with the reduced usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours:
     \[
     2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

3. **Energy Saved in 30 Days:**
   - The energy saved per day is:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh/day} - 2.7 \text{ kWh/day} = 4.5 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy saved is:
     \[
     4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is 135 kWh."

"To determine the cost of the meat and cheese needed for the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches required.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches needed:
- There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
- Therefore, the total number of sandwiches required is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

Next, we determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed:
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
- The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
- The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
- The total cost for the meat is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the cheese is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs of the meat and cheese to find the total amount spent:

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"At Allan's house, initially, there are twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that there are 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of corns Allan has now is:

\[ \text{Total number of corns} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

The total number of cannolis Allan has now is:

\[ \text{Total number of cannolis} = 100 \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \text{Total} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is 240."

He then took another 1,000 steps during the short walk, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. Since he had 2,000 steps left to take, the number of steps he took during his jog is 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:
\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 70 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:
\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:
\[ \text{Time to finish reading} = 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees who had contracts in June.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in May.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in June.
4. Calculate the total amount of money paid in May.
5. Calculate the total amount of money paid in June.
6. Sum the amounts from May and June to get the total amount paid.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, 1/4 of 40 employees' contracts expired, which means 10 employees' contracts expired. This leaves 30 employees with contracts in June.
2. Each employee works 40 hours per week. In May, the total number of hours worked by all employees is:
   \[
   40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} = 1600 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. In June, the total number of hours worked by the remaining 30 employees is:
   \[
   30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} = 1200 \text{ hours}
   \]
4. The total amount of money paid in May is:
   \[
   1600 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$24000
   \]
5. The total amount of money paid in June is:
   \[
   1200 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$18000
   \]
6. The total amount of money paid in the two months is:
   \[
   \$24000 + \$18000 = \$42000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold at ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

The cost of the magnets is $0.25 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $6.00
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $11.50 = -$1.50.

Since Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost, she is short by $1.50. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
-1.50"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and that 100% of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are not dangerous, meaning 1% of the candles are dangerous.

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Next, we know that 100% of the dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Therefore, all 500 dangerous candles will smell like wet dog.

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode} = 500 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples, which is 15, from the shortest trees.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( C \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"To calculate the total kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, let's break down the distances he traveled each day:

1. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - Distance traveled in the next two days = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

3. On the next day, he didn't travel at all.

4. During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Distance for the second week = 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's sum up all the distances:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next two days + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 + 240 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, the total kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, let's work backwards from the information given.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 times larger than Peter's locker.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is twice as large as Zack's locker.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"The comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet. Stanley's brother Oliver was at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3000."
"The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which means the second bank gave him $4000 * 2 = $8000. Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital, Mr. Josue now has $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000 in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break down the payments into segments based on the pricing changes.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
2. For the next 6 months (months 7 to 12), the cost is $12 per month.
3. For the next 4 months (months 13 to 16), the cost is $14 per month.

Let's calculate the total cost for each segment:

1. First 6 months:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. Next 6 months:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$72 \]

3. Next 4 months:
\[ 4 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$56 \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost for the 2 years:
\[ \$48 + \$72 + \$56 = \$176 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \$176."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the jeans Cole bought. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22, so the total cost is:
\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine the amount saved from each type of jeans. Let \( x \) be the amount saved from the jogger jeans. Then the amount saved from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - x \). Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, we have:
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
Thus, the amount saved from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's verify the savings. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 from it, so the amount he actually paid for the jogger jeans is:
\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 from it, so the amount he actually paid for the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]
The total amount he paid is:
\[ 20 + 24 = 46 \text{ dollars} \]
Since the total cost of the jeans is $50, the total savings should be:
\[ 50 - 46 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
But we know he saved $6 in total, so the savings calculation is consistent with the given information.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22 and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Finally, the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add these capacities together:
240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, while the ones she made attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30. Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see each day.

Let's calculate the total number of birds:

\[ \text{Total birds} = (3 \times 20) + (3 \times 30) \]

\[ \text{Total birds} = 60 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Total birds} = 150 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 150."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the cost of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket is $100. Therefore, the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $50, which is the amount he needs to buy the ticket.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of hotdogs prepared for the initial 36 guests. Since half of the guests were supposed to have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of guests having two hotdogs} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

\[
\text{Total hotdogs prepared} = 18 \times 2 = 36
\]

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests is:

\[
\text{Total hotdogs needed} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\text{Number of guests without a second hotdog} = 40 - 36 = 4
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
4

"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, which means her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, which totals to $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, the items are 20% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"The total cost of the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.
Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.
To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \) dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the amount of gas in gallons by 8:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending 120 cents, this means he spent 99% of his money. Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as \( M \). Since 99% of \( M \) is 120 cents, we can write:
\[ 0.99M = 120 \text{ cents} \]
\[ M = \frac{120 \text{ cents}}{0.99} \]
\[ M = \frac{120}{0.99} \text{ cents} \]
\[ M = 121.2121 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, we can verify that the amount he spent is indeed 120 cents. Now, we need to find out how much money he had left after buying the chips:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]

Since he had 1% of his money left, the 380 cents is 1% of his initial amount. We can confirm this:
\[ 0.01M = 380 \text{ cents} \]
\[ M = \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{0.01} \]
\[ M = 38000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know George initially had 38000 cents. We need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{38000 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents}} = \frac{37880 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents}} = 505.0667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, we take the integer part of the division:
\[ 505 \text{ candy bars} \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ 505 \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends. When these 20 lollipops are shared equally among four friends, each friend receives 20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops."

"Sitti and Juris together have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Including their 6 friends, there are a total of 1 + 2 = 3 people sharing the oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

56 oranges ÷ 3 people = 18.666... oranges per person.

Since we cannot split oranges into fractions in this context, each person will get 18 oranges, and there will be some oranges left over."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of onions needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount.
   - Therefore, he needs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

2. **Calculate the cost of the onions:**
   - The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
   - He needs 4 pounds of onions.
   - The cost of the onions is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock:**
   - He needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box is $2.00.
   - The cost of the beef stock is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock.
   - Total cost = $8 + $4 = $12.

5. **Determine the number of servings:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.

6. **Calculate the cost per serving:**
   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings.
   - Cost per serving = $12 / 6 = $2.00.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater.

Given:
- Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.
- Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.

Let's calculate the time for Bernadette's drive:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's drive time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave to account for her longer drive time.

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Wayne's drive time} + 5 \text{ minutes} - \text{Bernadette's drive time} \]
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = 9 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = -7 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the result is negative, it means Bernadette should actually leave 7 minutes after Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 7 minutes after Wayne.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet."
"Elizabeth bought:

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 red beads

So, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth is:
140 - 60 = 80

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Initially, the house temperature is 40 degrees. During the 3 hours of baking, the temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total increase in temperature due to baking is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after baking is:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total cooling due to the window is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened is:

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, let's first calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
- Swim: 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
- Bike: 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James takes for the run as \( R \) minutes. The total time for James is:
- Swim: 36 minutes
- Bike: 85 minutes
- Run: \( R \) minutes

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + \( R \) = 121 + \( R \) minutes

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
- James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
- 121 + \( R \) = 170 + 10
- 121 + \( R \) = 180
- \( R \) = 180 - 121
- \( R \) = 59 minutes

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money Michael has:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the question, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 17 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 17 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the original cost per balloon.

1. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
2. Therefore, the cost per balloon was $900 / 20 = $45.

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, making the new cost per balloon $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

1. The cost for 170 balloons at $65 per balloon is 170 * $65.

Let's calculate this:
170 * 65 = 11050

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 11050."
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

Thus, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. The value of the sapphires she traded is:

3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

Since she gets two rubies in return, the value of the rubies she receives is:

2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (8 - 3 = 5) and 2 rubies. The total value of her sapphires is:

5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

Adding the value of the rubies, the total value of all her jewels is:

$4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is $6400."

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

First, let's calculate the volume of one raised bed:
- The dimensions of one raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
- The volume of one raised bed is \(2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32\) cubic feet.

Next, we calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds:
- The total volume is \(32 \times 10 = 320\) cubic feet.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are needed. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil:
- The number of bags needed is \(320 \div 2 = 160\) bags.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the potting soil. Each bag costs $12:
- The total cost is \(160 \times 12 = 1920\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is $1920."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \(0.60 \times 15 = 9\).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \(15 + 9 = 24\).
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \(15 + 24 = 39\).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
- Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
- Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39

Let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies that have spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number since partial trips are not possible:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To calculate the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to first determine her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

Each aluminum can is worth two cents, and she drinks three cans a week. Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Each plastic bottle is worth three cents, and she drinks five bottles a week. Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Adding these together gives her total weekly earnings:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find her earnings over a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Thus, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is 16."
"The cost of the small pizza is $8. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much, which is 3 * $8 = $24. Therefore, the total amount Sally spends is $8 + $24 = $32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free,"" so for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost for 1 pack is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Calculating the Cost per Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $2.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per razor is \(\frac{2.00}{4} = 0.50\) dollars.

5. **Converting to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per razor in cents is \(0.50 \times 100 = 50\) cents.

Thus, the final numerical answer in cents is:
50"
"To calculate the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid.

First, let's determine the heights of the cheerleaders:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
- The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The total height of the 10 cheerleaders is:
\[ 9 \times 64 + 60 = 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

Now, let's arrange these cheerleaders in the human pyramid:
- Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): 64 inches each.
- Second layer (3 cheerleaders): 64 inches each.
- Third layer (2 cheerleaders): 64 inches each.
- Top layer (1 cheerleader): 60 inches.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer:
\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

Calculating each term:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since she has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour, we can calculate the total minutes she walks each day.

First, we find the total minutes she walks in one day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since she works for 5 days, we multiply the daily total by 5:
\[ 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, after 5 days at the office, she has walked 12000 minutes."
"Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which is 3 * 14 = 42 years old. Therefore, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is 38."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took each day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, the total number of rides per day is:
1 (morning) + 1 (afternoon) = 2 rides per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over the 14 days:
2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 rides.

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides: 28 rides * $6/ride = $168.

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2/ride = $56.

Finally, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
$168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $224."
"Ashley brought 5 boxes with ten oranges in each box, so she brought a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. Together, they brought 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 greek orange pies."
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards.
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards.

Together, they used \( 91 + 182 = 273 \) yards of yarn."
"Cherrie's 5 friends want a total of 2 friends wanting 5 gifts each and 3 friends wanting 2 gifts each. Therefore, the total number of gifts her friends want is calculated as follows:

\[2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} + 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts}\]

Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. Therefore, the total number of gifts she buys is:

\[16 \text{ gifts for her friends} + 10 \text{ random gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}\]

The final numerical answer is 26."
"If the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, then the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is 8 * 2 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Since she bought four packs of gum in total, and two of them were strawberry, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = $1 \).

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 4 piece of wood = $4
  - Number of sticks per 2 x 4 piece = 200
  - Cost per stick for 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 8 piece of wood = $6
  - Number of sticks per 2 x 8 piece = 400
  - Cost per stick for 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible within his budget of $24.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make:
- Total number of sticks = 4 pieces * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600."
"Each sled dog has four legs, and thus each dog would need one pair of snowshoes. Since Mario has 6 sled dogs, he would need 6 pairs of snowshoes.

The cost for one pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the cost for 6 pairs would be:

\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total cost without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total cost for the bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from her total cost without the bus pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, which is consistent with the farm having 30 cows, as 30 * 2 = 60, but the zoo has only 20 cows, so this information is not directly relevant to the number of animals on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

To find the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined, we add the number of cows and sheep on the farm to the number of cows and sheep on the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 20 cows + 20 sheep = 40 animals

Total: 40 (farm) + 40 (zoo) = 80 animals

The farm and zoo have combined 80 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which totals to 16 items. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can find out how many items Sophia bought by dividing the total number of items Rose bought by 4.

\[ \text{Number of items Sophia bought} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes, which totals to 8 items.

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 8."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{152 \text{ days}} \approx 690.13 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 690 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings for the week are:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]"
"To find out how much money Julie has left, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find out how much Julie has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500 = 100
   \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400
   \]

3. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
   \]

4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find out how much Julie has left.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 400 - 100 = 300
   \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let the cost of the lot be \( L \) and the cost of the house be \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write the equation:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write another equation:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $160 on her canvas bags."
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes.
2. Determine the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the average number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight.

First, the fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Joe throws 25 punches per minute. So, the total number of punches thrown in 15 minutes is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 160 = 80 \]

So, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint the house and then scale it up for 5 people.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:
\[ \frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

This means that one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, it would take:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"If Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, then she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she also has 20 sofas.

Jenna has the same number of sofas as Ophelia, which is 20.

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have together is:
Ophelia's sofas + Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's sofas + Jenna's chairs
= 20 + 22 + 20 + 66
= 128

The total number of sofas and chairs that they have is 128."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Total amount paid: $48
Cost of the CD: $4

Amount spent on the headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Amount spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4
Amount spent on the headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set.

Cost of one CD: $4

Number of CDs Tom could have bought with $44 = Amount spent on headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with $44 = $44 / $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with $44 = 11

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours for the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people.

On the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on than those who got off, which means 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
80 - 21 + 7 = 66 people.

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then Jame's cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference between them is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, which means the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.
- Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \).

The equation for the total cost can be written as:
\[ \text{Cost of computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ 300 \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share.
   - His new share is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after these additions is \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His amount after spending is \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8.
   - Let's denote the amount he saved as \( x \).
   - His total amount before tripling is \( 13 + x \).
   - After tripling, his total amount is \( 3(13 + x) \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact amount he saved, we assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact amount he saved. Therefore, we can only express the final amount in terms of his savings.

The final amount he has now is:
\[ 3(13 + x) \]

Without the specific value of \( x \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. If we assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value, we would need additional information to determine \( x \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis can save in the second half of April to meet his target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month of April would be the sum of the savings from the first and second halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

Perform the division:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. For the second half of April, he saves twice as much, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:

"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first calculate the total amount each of them earns.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. If he finishes 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. If she finishes 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Jeff walks 6 miles each day to and from work. Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan needs is \( 5 \times 80 - J \).

According to the problem, this number is also equal to \( J + 2 \). So we can set up the following equation:

\[ J + 2 = 5 \times 80 - J \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Calculate \( 5 \times 80 \):
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

2. Substitute this value into the equation:
\[ J + 2 = 400 - J \]

3. Add \( J \) to both sides of the equation to combine like terms:
\[ J + J + 2 = 400 \]
\[ 2J + 2 = 400 \]

4. Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 2J = 398 \]

5. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ J = 199 \]

Jonathan currently has 199 toys."
"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, I will first determine the cost of each item he wants to buy, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 each = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25 each = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 = $10.00

Now, I will sum these costs:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

Next, I will apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

Finally, I will subtract the discount from the total cost:
Total cost after discount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $1500 in this case), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30% already earned.

Let's calculate the commission for each part:

- Commission on the first $1000: $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300
- Commission on the amount over $1000: $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total commission:

- Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 from her sales."

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice as long as 16 minutes is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly savings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. Therefore, his weekly earnings are calculated as follows:

Thus, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact number of cups Juan must reduce, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, and we are not given a specific value for \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups."

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we sum their weights and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"The angle of the great pyramids from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour upward from the pyramid. If the sun moves for 10 hours, the total upward movement of the sun relative to the ground is:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

To find the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we add the initial angle of the pyramids from the ground to the total upward movement of the sun:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs to buy.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night, she read for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know her reading speed. She can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Adding the pages read in the second week, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

First, calculate Shiloh's age in 7 years:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N + 7 \):
\[ N + 7 = \frac{51}{3} \]
\[ N + 7 = 17 \]

Finally, solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 17 - 7 \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, the nephew is 10 years old today."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00.
   - Therefore, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.
   - So, for two teeth, the tooth fairy gave $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts given by the tooth fairy:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00."
"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we first need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Mark scored 20 fewer goals than Richie. Therefore, Mark scored \(80 - 20 = 60\) goals.
3. Anna scored 45 fewer goals than Richie. Therefore, Anna scored \(80 - 45 = 35\) goals.

Now, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.

Adding these together, the total number of goals scored is \(80 + 60 + 35 = 175\).

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate the amount of money Mitchell made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $20 on wooden action figures, Peter has:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount Peter spends on plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday. There are 4 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), and each plastic action figure costs $2. The total amount spent on plastic action figures is:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8 on plastic action figures, Peter has:
\[ 50 - 8 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's determine how many wooden action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $42. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he can buy is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]
(The floor function is used because he can only buy whole action figures.)

Next, let's determine how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining $42. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{42}{2} \right\rfloor = 21 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ 8 + 21 = 29 \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of repairing the damaged vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is $20 each, and she had 3 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of repairing the damaged vases is $12 each, and she broke 4 vases, so the total cost for repairing the vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, we add these costs together:
$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308.

Therefore, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, calculate the total amount removed over 2 years:
- There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months.
- If she removes $100 each month, the total amount removed in 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount:
- Initial amount: $3000
- Total amount removed: $2400
- Remaining amount: \(3000 - 2400 = 600\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. Therefore, the cost of bread is $3.00.
- The cost of different cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the cost of the ingredients is $30.00.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of ingredients
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. Therefore, the total revenue is:
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."
"First, I will calculate the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Next, I will determine how many crayon muffins she can make. She melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one crayon muffin, so the number of crayon muffins she can make is:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin = 24 crayon muffins

Now, I will calculate the total amount of money she can make by selling the crayon muffins at $1.50 each:

24 crayon muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $36.00."
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the cost of padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times (12 \text{ dollars/square foot} + 2 \text{ dollars/square foot}) = 216 \times 14 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11664 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ 11664 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

From the information given:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds seen = 50 (day 1) + 50 (day 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (day 4) + 120 (day 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)

Total number of birds seen = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 450 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds seen per day = Total number of birds seen / Number of days
Average number of birds seen per day = 450 / 7

Average number of birds seen per day = 64.28571428571429

Rounded to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 64.29."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result from the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe to find the correct temperature setting.

The temperature to be set is:
\[ 520 - \left( \frac{4}{100} \times 520 \right) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 499.2 degrees to achieve the desired temperature for her recipe."
"The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equivalent to 90 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes, and 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes).

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equivalent to 125 minutes (since 2 hours = 120 minutes, and 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes).

To find the total time it will take Max to watch both movies, we add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie:

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's price gives us the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes. 

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups, which is 10 more than Judy had brought. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy had brought, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups. The total number of dishes brought by Judy and her friend is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. The discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 per hour, so Jill's earnings are:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

John's total hours worked are:
\[ \text{John's total hours} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her exercise session.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{100 \times 1600}{200} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000}{200} \]
\[ x = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]
So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. The first test shows a speed of 47 WPM, and the second test shows a speed of 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by 5 words per minute for the third test, his speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have the three typing speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these speeds and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. To find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let the smallest angle be denoted as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ 90 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, I will determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, I will add up all the cents Colby has:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, I will divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 69."

- Total legs: \(20 + 8 + 20 = 48\)

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. He increases this weight by 50%, so the increase is 8 * 0.50 = 4 pounds. Therefore, the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. Since this weight is too heavy, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, which is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, let's break down his purchases and gifts year by year.

**Year 1:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought with savings: 1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5
- Total games after Year 1: 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games from Year 1: 22
- Games bought with savings: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5
- Total games after Year 2: 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games from Year 2: 51
- Games bought with savings: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we divide the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we divide the additional distance by the rate:

\[ \text{Additional time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find the hourly rate for Ruiz:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals to find the combined amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

If he originally had $100, then the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50/cup = $7.50.
- Over four hours, the total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50/hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00.
- Over two hours, the total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00/hour = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Thus, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations for 400 miles.

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 \]

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 145,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} \]

\[ \text{Months} = 72 \]

Now, we need to convert the number of months into years.

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{72}{12} \]

\[ \text{Years} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump in cents, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, 1 pump gives 60 washes.

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00, and it provides 120 washes. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:

\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\$24.00}{120 \text{ washes}} = \$0.20 \text{ per wash}
\]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1 = 100$ cents):

\[
\text{Cost per pump in cents} = \$0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the cost of each pump is 20 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.5 = 17.5 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 10.5 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.5 = 24.5 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.5 + 24.5 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from the amount of money Joe has:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the number of pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

First, calculate the total number of dozens of croissants:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

Therefore, it costs an additional \$65,560 to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial 5 months.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
   - The total cost for the extended 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial 5 months and the extended 45 months.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[ 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days it will take to sell the total amount of meat.

First, Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, the bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Thus, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he is at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving any to his sister:

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck during the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled ten cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled ten cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled in the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"First, I will convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to make the comparison easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.333 feet. The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.333 feet = 0.667 feet more to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to 2/12 = 0.167 feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 0.667 feet, I will divide 0.667 feet by 0.167 feet/year.

0.667 feet / 0.167 feet/year = 4 years.

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."

   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. **Price of a silver jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum the prices of the three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
\]
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. In total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close the gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he misses \( m \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

We need to find the maximum \( m \) such that:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Let's assume Manny misses \( m \) classes. Then the cost of the missed classes is \( 10m \) (since each missed class costs $10). The cost per class becomes:
\[ \frac{60 - 10m}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 - 10m \leq 10(10 - m) \]
\[ 60 - 10m \leq 100 - 10m \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 \]

This inequality is always true, which means the cost per class will never exceed $10 as long as he misses fewer than 6 classes. If he misses 6 classes, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60 - 10 \times 6}{10 - 6} = \frac{60 - 60}{4} = 0 \]
This is not a valid scenario since the cost per class cannot be zero.

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 5 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the weekly customers processed by both Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles.
Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

The number of miles Lynn ran is 17."
"To solve this problem, let's first find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to shovel the entire volume of the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, I will add the base price to the cost of each additional feature.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, I will sum these amounts:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the raise amount.
2. Calculate the bonus amount.
3. Add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary.
4. Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Let's start with the raise:
- Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

Next, the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- Bonus amount = 1/2 * $20000 = $10000.

Now, add the raise and bonus to the original salary:
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, calculate the annual salary:
- Annual salary = $31000 * 12 = $372000.

Therefore, Tim will make $372000 in a year."

"To calculate the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to consider the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sales from Red Hats in the First Month:**
   - Ariadne earned $400 from red hats in the first month.

2. **Sales from Green Hats in the First Month:**
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Let the total sales from green hats in the first month be \( G \).
   - Therefore, \( 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \).
   - Solving for \( G \), we get \( G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \).

3. **Total Sales in the First Month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

4. **Sales in the Second Month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \).

5. **Total Sales in Two Months:**
   - Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month.
   - Total sales in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100."

2. **Kassidy's Money**: Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. Therefore, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.
3. **Rayna's Money**: Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

If they decide to add together their money and share it equally, each person would get:
\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"The game originally had four quarters, each 12 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the four quarters is:

"First, let's determine the number of management employees in the company. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management:

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.2 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company:

\[ \text{Number of employees who oversee the company} = 10 \times \frac{30}{100} = 10 \times 0.3 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To determine the total tablespoons of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total tablespoons of dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, we multiply this amount by 16 to find the total for 16 muffins:
Total tablespoons of dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 8.25 * 16

Let's calculate this:
8.25 * 16 = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, the total tablespoons of dry ingredients needed to make 16 muffins is 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they share equally, we first need to determine the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds of candy.
Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.
Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.

Adding these amounts together:
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy in total.

Now, they want to share this 12 pounds of candy equally among the three of them. To find out how much each person would get, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:
12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

Therefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to account for the days that have already been recorded and the days that are yet to be recorded.

Christina has a total of thirty days in the month. She had twelve good days and eight bad days, which means the remaining days are neutral. The total number of neutral days is:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]

Next, we break down the days she has already recorded:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were bad.
- The last eight days were neutral.

So, the number of good days already recorded is:
\[ 8 \]

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The first of these three days was good.
- The second of these three days was neutral.
- The third of these three days was good.

So, the number of good days in the next three days is:
\[ 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \]

To find the total number of good days left in the month, we subtract the good days already recorded from the total number of good days:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

Then, we add the good days in the next three days:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let \( x \) represent the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2x + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 9 \]

Thus, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height in inches is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The difference in height needed is:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Initially, James has toys for 4 dogs. He needs one toy per dog, so he needs 4 toys. He currently has 4 toys, so he does not need to buy any toys at this point.

When he went back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left. Since he had 4 dogs when he left, there were \(4 \times 2 = 8\) more dogs in the shelter. This means there are \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs in total now. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 12 toys. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy \(12 - 4 = 8\) toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now \(12 - 3 = 9\). Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 9 toys. He already has 12 toys, so he has enough and does not need to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total amount invested by the three people is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.

"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use the value of \( M \) to find \( C \):
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now, we find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let \( x \) represent the original length of the dress in centimeters. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm to the bottom. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in turtle mode and the time it takes to mow the other half in rabbit mode, and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the times to minutes:
- In turtle mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In rabbit mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode, we need to find half of the time for each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in turtle mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.
- Time to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

Now, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Total time: \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of four candies is $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now we know that each candy costs $0.30. Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. First, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Then, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.

Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years is:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to determine how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. First, we calculate how many more coins Neil saves per month compared to Rong:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins/month} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years, the total number of coins Neil has saved is:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins both Rong and Neil have saved together in ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"To solve this, let's break down the costs:

- Each vaccine costs $20, and there are 2 vaccines, so the cost for the vaccines is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \(T\). Therefore, the heartworm check costs \(0.6T\).
- The total bill \(T\) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: \(T = 40 + 0.6T\).

To find \(T\), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (5 \times \text{Cost of one banana}) + (12 \times \text{Cost of one apple}) + (7 \times \text{Cost of one orange}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = (5 \times 1) + (12 \times 0.5) + (7 \times 3) \]

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

The total capacity of all three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck can be calculated by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - (4000 + 4800) \]
\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
dumplings. With 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he received 3 * $20 = $60.

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is 9 hours."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

Thus, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 68%."
"To calculate the total charge for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to determine the daily charge and then multiply it by the number of days in 2 weeks.

Now, we calculate the total charge for 14 days:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 168 \]"
"First, let's determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Adding the total quarts of both types of ice cream:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, considering the deal of ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per set of 3 scoops:**
   - The cost for 2 scoops is \(2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00\).
   - The cost for 1 free scoop is \$1.50.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them consumes over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area.

First, calculate the area that needs to be covered:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, calculate the number of tiles needed for this area:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \text{Area to be covered} \times \text{Tiles per square foot} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds.

The cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost he incurred from the cost at the store:

"To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price per computer.
2. Calculate the new price per computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, the original price per computer was $700. With a 10% increase, the new price per computer is:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + (700 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{New Price} \times \text{Number of Computers} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 770 \times 500 \]

"To calculate the total number of taps, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which Helga dances.

1. **With both hands at her sides:**
   - Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
   - Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.
   - For 3 minutes (since she dances for 5 minutes total and raises her arms for 2 minutes), the total number of taps is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

2. **With her arms raised:**
   - Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.
   - For 2 minutes, the total number of taps is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Adding the taps from both parts, the combined total number of taps is 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself.

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so the total cost for asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(450 + 75 = 525\) dollars.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.

So, the net cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is \(525 - 120 = 405\) dollars.

The pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it is not fixed. Therefore, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is \(450 - 405 = 45\) dollars.

"Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, so there were 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza had 12 slices, so there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices of pizza initially.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. This means they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each. Since there are three of them, they ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. This means they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each. Since there are two of them, they ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices of pizza.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows smashed by Hannah:
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, the total number of windows smashed by Hannah is the sum of the windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, let's find Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for these books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A got:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, candidate B received:
\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes received by candidates A and B is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is:

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes."
"Boris originally has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Now, Beck has 90 - 87 = 3 fewer apples than Boris."
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the cubes and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

First, calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 1/2 = 4 ounces.

Now, sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. Therefore, Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 98 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

From the information given:
- \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \) (since the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball)
- The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music.

So, we can write the equation for the total number of students as:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"Jeremy scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) birds. So, the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \) birds."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls in each class by calculating 40% of 40:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Finally, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara initially added 3 slices to the plate that already had 2 slices, making the total 5 slices. She then tripled the number of slices, which means she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices. After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Then her friend stole 5 slices, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices. Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

Melissa has:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 7 days in a week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the packs Mark bought:
Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark received:
- He gets 1 card worth $4000.
- He gets 1 card worth $1000.
- He gets 30 cards worth an average of $50 each.

The value of the 30 cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the values of all the cards together:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"To determine the savings, we first calculate the total cost for each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total costs of the two parks:
- Savings = \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

Therefore, the family will be able to save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the cost per day before the switch:
   - He used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each.
   - Cost per day = 500 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato = $250.

2. Calculate the cost per day after the switch:
   - He now buys 500 tomatoes at $0.4 each.
   - Cost per day = 500 tomatoes * $0.4/tomato = $200.

3. Calculate the daily savings:
   - Daily savings = Cost per day before - Cost per day after = $250 - $200 = $50.

4. Calculate the weekly savings:
   - Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7 days = $50 * 7 = $350.

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has \(56 \times 2 = 112\) marbles.
3. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Carl has \(56 \times 4 = 224\) marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[224 + 112 = 336\]

The final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into six groups. We then need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into twelve groups.

First, we calculate the number of students per group if there are six groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many groups are needed if there are 12 groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[ \text{Number of groups needed} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since we cannot have half a group, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means we need 5 groups to accommodate all 54 students. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups, which is simply the difference between 12 and the number of groups we can actually form, which is 4.5 rounded up to 5:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5 \]

Since we can only have whole groups, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8. Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:
\[ 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekday rental: 60 chairs per day
- Weekend rental: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs
- Total chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so Arnold took 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. After Arnold stole the bananas, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas. Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Since there are 4 roommates and they divide the cost equally, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ dollars/year}}{4 \text{ roommates}} = 300 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 27 small stickers, she has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her remaining large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and each small button is worth one small sticker, 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, she has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, 20 large stickers are worth \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 27 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - The total number of buttons is \(27 + 20 + 60 = 107\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let the number of votes against the new regulation be \( x \). Then the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Number of students needing size extra-small (XS): 11
2. Number of students needing size small (S) is twice the number needing size extra-small: \( S = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)
3. Number of students needing size medium (M) is four less than the number needing size small: \( M = 22 - 4 = 18 \)
4. Number of students needing size large (L) is half the number needing size medium: \( L = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
5. Number of students needing size extra-large (XL) is six more than the number needing size large: \( XL = 9 + 6 = 15 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of students needing each size:

"To calculate the amount to be paid after a 5% discount on a $140 item, first, we need to find the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we first need to calculate the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

The total number of songs in 20 playlists is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Each song is 10 hours long, so the total number of hours for 6000 songs is:

Thus, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the big race. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"Let P represent the number of Pomeranian puppies. According to the information given, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one third of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. We know that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, we can set up the equation based on the information that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{number of Pomeranian puppies} = 6 \]

To find the total number of Pomeranian puppies (P), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \text{number of Pomeranian puppies} = 6 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{number of Pomeranian puppies} = 18 \]

Since the Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{total number of puppies} = 18 \]

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ \text{total number of puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ \text{total number of puppies} = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

The third house needs \( x \) cases, which is 100 cases. Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the total from eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, let's add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the number of wheels left will be 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find the amount of the discount:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies in series and the number of older movies.

Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these are in series:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies} \]

The remaining movies are:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies} \]

40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies} \]

The rest of the remaining movies are not older:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the normal movies is $10 each, while the older movies cost $5 each.

The cost for the series movies is:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the older movies is:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the normal movies is:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ 4400 \]"

$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- So, their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score is calculated as \( 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score is calculated as \( 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for Ava's and Emma's actions, we get:
- Emma's score: \( 10E_e + 5B_e \)
- Ava's score: \( 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \)
\[ = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Therefore, the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, the combined cost of the other two pizzas must be:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is:
3 times/day * 5 days = 15 times.

On two other days, they ride twice as many times as they do on usual days. So, on these two days, they ride:
3 times/day * 2 = 6 times/day.
For these two days, the total number of rides is:
6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

Adding the rides from all days of the week, we get:
15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

Therefore, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. The sales assistant at the pet store took 17 fish, which included both orange and white fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding the 17 fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We already know that \( o = 17 - w \). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 20 - w = 8 + 2w \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2w + w \]
\[ 12 = 3w \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, if Bob bought 4 white fish, he must have bought \( 17 - 4 = 13 \) orange fish. After adding these to his pond, the number of orange fish became \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish became \( 4 + 4 = 8 \). Indeed, 16 is twice 8, which satisfies the condition of the problem.

The number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week.

**Step 1: Total distance traveled in a week**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

For 5 days, the total distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Amount of fuel consumed in a week**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Cost of the fuel consumed in a week**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200

Carrie also received 140 quarters, which is:
140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
$200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is:
3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties

The amount spent on the twenties is:
6 twenties * $20/twenty = $120

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is:
$35

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
$120 (from twenties) + $35 (from quarters) = $155

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales are 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"To determine Jamie's pay for working 11 hours on last Tuesday, we need to calculate her earnings from both her regular hours and her overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ \text{Regular hourly rate} = \$20 \]
\[ \text{Regular pay for 8 hours} = 8 \times 20 = \$160 \]

Next, we calculate the number of overtime hours she worked:
\[ \text{Total hours worked} = 11 \]
\[ \text{Regular hours} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Overtime hours} = 11 - 8 = 3 \]

Now, we determine her overtime hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate:
\[ \text{Overtime hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = \$30 \]

Then, we calculate her overtime pay for the 3 hours:
\[ \text{Overtime pay for 3 hours} = 3 \times 30 = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total pay for the day:
\[ \text{Total pay} = \text{Regular pay} + \text{Overtime pay} \]

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the monthly total salary by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Number of employees after three months**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Monthly total salary**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. The total salary paid to all employees in one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Total salary paid after three months**

To find the total salary paid after three months, we multiply the monthly total salary by three:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants one tree, so the number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the number of trees planted by the teachers is:

- Fourth graders: 40 passed.
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \) passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, Milo has two bags of glass chips. Since each bag contains 72 chips, the total number of chips is:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Therefore, the total area of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for the length:
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ 4 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he sold more than he had. To correct this, he would need to return 50 candies. After returning the 50 unsold candies, he would have 50 candies left. Then he ordered 100 more candies, so he now has 50 + 100 = 150 candies. Since he started with 100 and sold 150, he needs to sell 150 more candies to have all of his candy sold. Therefore, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is 150."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made this amount of money during the week, which consists of 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"John and DeSean together made 9 S'mores + 9 S'mores = 18 S'mores.
They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3, so they have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 32 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.
To find out how many S'mores each can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are two people):
32 S'mores / 2 = 16 S'mores per person.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack and his two significantly worse friends can play for 20 minutes each. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times 20 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

The total play time for Jack and his two significantly worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The play time for the friend who is significantly better is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these together gives the total play time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 4 hours, we convert 4 hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + F + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S + F = 10 \]

Since \( F = C \) and \( S = C \), we can replace \( F \) with \( S \):
\[ 6S + S = 10 \]
\[ 7S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{7} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{10}{7} \right) = \frac{20}{7} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[ \frac{20}{7} \text{ ounces} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{20}{7} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by its respective cost and then add the totals together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the totals:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

Therefore, John spent $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he should buy, we add the cupcakes he already has and subtract that sum from the total number of cupcakes needed.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After selling and giving away cars, the number of cars Joe remains with is:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time in hours:
- First day: 8 hours
- Second day: 4 hours

Total time in hours = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert this total time into minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
- Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"During the lunch break, half the number of cars that were in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class had gone. Initially, there were 50 cars in the morning and 20 more cars arrived during the first break, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70 cars. When he got out of class for the lunch break, half of these 70 cars had gone, which means 70 / 2 = 35 cars remained in the parking lot. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate John's earnings for a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of tasks John completes in a day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Number of tasks John completes in a day:
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks.
So, the number of tasks John completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings:
Each task pays $1.20.
So, the daily earnings are:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings:
There are 7 days in a week.
So, the weekly earnings are:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final numerical answer is:

"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game to the points from the second game: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

The total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, I will first calculate the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food, and then find the difference.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins of cat food} \]

Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins of dog food} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, I subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is 153."
"Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, which means she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, which means she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. Altogether, Cindy had 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars

Second week production: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars

Third week production: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

Fourth week production: Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \) and the distance of the highway as \( d \).

The distance \( d \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
For the kangaroos:
\[ d = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ d = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( d \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Using the formula for time again:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
For the turtles:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{54v}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} \]
\[ \text{time} = \frac{54v}{2v} \]
\[ \text{time} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway."

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, we subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English to find the total number of students good at math:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then add the intermission time. The total time for one group is:

2 minutes (setup) + 6 minutes (performance) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to add the 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total time available for performances is:

120 minutes (concert duration) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the total available performance time by the time required for one group:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."
"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars.

- There are 40 white shirts in total.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with and without buttons.

- There are 50 floral shirts in total.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
- Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
- The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.

The difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Thus, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5/\text{tray} = \$75 \]

Thus, the farmer will earn:

\[ \text{Final numerical answer} = \$75 \]"
"Initially, Farm X has 55 goats and Farm Y has 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45 goats. From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he sold from Farm X, which means he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25 goats. The total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 45 + 25 = 70 goats."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food**: Each basket costs $25.
2. **Cost of Red Food**: Each basket costs $18.
3. **Discount on Red Food**: For each basket of red food, you get $2 off.

First, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of red food before any discount:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Now, apply the discount of $2 per basket of red food:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
Subtract the total discount from the original cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food to find the total amount to be paid:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total amount to be paid is:
\[ 123 \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned: One-half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms: Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, it would take \(45 \times 20\) minutes to clean 45 rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

Let's do the calculation:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.

In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes built each year: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to provide at least 54 glue sticks, given that each pack contains 8 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, 7 packs contain:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

This is more than enough to provide 54 glue sticks, and it will leave him with 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles from the original amount. Therefore, the amount of water on the second day is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount on the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Now, there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Now, there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, after Day 3, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:
\[ 3430 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ 1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. The number of oranges Jennifer remained with is 12 - 9 = 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 12 badges in a year, as there are 12 months in a year.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns \(12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6\) badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy earns \(12 \times 3 = 36\) badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns:
\[36 - 6 = 30\]

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige baked:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the total number of banana bread loaves she baked:
- Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour.
- In 5 hours, she bakes \( 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from the 10 loaves:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, \( 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, \( 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the total amount raised is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

First, we can express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From the second equation, we have \( A = F - 12 \).
- Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation, we get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[ \text{Cost of the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000."
"Micah sold half the number of glasses that the boys sold together. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, they sold a total of 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

\[
\text{Total cost for the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Sarah will use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to know how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = \$40 - \$40 = \$0
\]

Since Sarah has no money left after selling the original rope, she cannot buy any new rope. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[
\text{Money left over} = \$0

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

Given that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, so we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age.

1. The cost of bacon:
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. The cost of chicken:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - 6 packets of chicken cost = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. The cost of strawberries:
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - 3 packs of strawberries cost = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. The cost of apples:
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - 7 packs of apples cost = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Kelly's budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"Let \( x \) represent the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts in minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the concert duration and the encore duration, which is given as 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 15 = 65
\]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x = 50
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 25
\]

Thus, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, which is 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many microphones won't fit into pairs. If 20% of the microphones won't fit, then 80% of the microphones will fit into pairs.

The total number of microphones is 50. Therefore, the number of microphones that won't fit is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

This means that the number of microphones that will fit into pairs is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. Therefore, the number of birds flying overhead is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of birds in the three groups feeding. Each group has 8 birds, and there are 3 groups. Therefore, the total number of birds feeding is:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we can find the total number of birds Jerry counts by adding the number of birds nesting, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding:

\[
6 + 4 + 24 = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[
34
\]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She placed these 50 cookies equally into five jars, so each jar contained 50 / 5 = 10 cookies."
"To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each African daisy has 10 petals.

Total petals for African daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, find the difference in the number of petals between the African daisies and the orchids:
Difference = Total petals for African daisies - Total petals for orchids
Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is 25%."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Let's break down the costs:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Mark used to make $10 an hour and his pay was raised by $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour. He works 8 hours a day, so his daily earnings are 8 * $12 = $96. Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are 5 * $96 = $480. Therefore, the final numerical answer is 480."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe is \( x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
- Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6x \) (since Joe paid $6 per lawn)
- Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \)
- Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 5x \times 6 = 30x \)

The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns is $54x, and the earnings from selling lemonade is:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

Since the earnings from mowing lawns are $54x, we can set up the equation:
\[ 54x = 54 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can find the earnings from selling lemonade:
\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"Carl’s weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month:
10 times a month * 3 hours each time = 30 hours a month

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns in a month from renting his car:
30 hours a month * $25 an hour = $750 a month

Now, let's calculate the profit John makes in a month by subtracting his car payment from his monthly earnings:
$750 a month - $500 a month = $250 a month

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is $250 a month."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.
Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had, so Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
Martha now has 7 notebooks.
The difference between the number of notebooks Martha now has and the number Joseph has is 7 - 6 = 1.

The final numerical answer is 1."
"Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed \(1 + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{5}\) times the distance Dijana rowed. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, Anis rowed \(\frac{6}{5} \times 50 = 60\) miles.

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is the sum of the distances each rowed, which is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles."
"Susan initially had 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, she had 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. She was going to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. Therefore, each nephew would get 96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday, which means she read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Daniel was not able to read any pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we add the pages Denise read yesterday and today, and then subtract the total pages Daniel read (which is just the pages he read yesterday):

Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 pages

Difference = Denise's total pages - Daniel's total pages
Difference = 28 - 13 = 15 pages

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, the pot can be divided into 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means the pot can serve 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

If the pot is filled to serve 4 adult bowls, then it can also serve 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 people in total, the pot can serve 4 adult bowls, which means it can serve 8 child bowls. This is because the pot's capacity is the same regardless of the number of adult or child bowls it can fill.

Now, we need to determine how many times the pot can be refilled with the 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 children and each child gets one bowl, the pot can be refilled 8 times to serve all 4 children one bowl each.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 8 times from the leftover soup."
"To calculate the total amount William spent, we need to multiply the cost of the notebooks by the number of notebooks he bought and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, the material required is 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards.

For large masks:
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, the material required is 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards.

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day. Therefore, the total time he spends on work and walking his dog is 8 + 1 = 9 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is 24 - 9 = 15 hours."
"Tim originally has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoe boxes, then he has:

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

From the information given, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, I will determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \) acres. 

Adding 100 acres to this, Farmer Smith's farm is \( 400 + 100 = 500 \) acres. 

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, I will add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm: 

\( 200 + 500 = 700 \) acres. 

Therefore, the two farms together have 700 acres.

"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Determine his hourly earnings.
3. Calculate his daily earnings for an eight-hour workday.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate his hourly earnings. He gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes:
\[ 40 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20 \text{ per package} = \$8.00 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, we calculate his daily earnings for an eight-hour workday:
\[ \$8.00 \text{ per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = \$64.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$64.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. Therefore, the time spent on an extreme sudoku is:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 minutes by 30:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in the time he spends on the extreme sudoku puzzle. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6."
"Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
- The cake costs $11.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons:
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons.
- The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- Therefore, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25.
- The total cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream:
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
- The total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of the cake + Cost of the balloons + Cost of the ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Therefore, each one of them received half of this amount:
- Amount each received = $28 / 2 = $14.

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.
In total, Larry has 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has already used \( 9 \) cups in each of the 3 rows, she has used \( 9 \times 3 = 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups for chamomile and mint tea. This confirms that the remaining 15 cups are indeed for cinnamon tea.

Now, to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we note that each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea.

The final numerical answer is:
4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and the total number of berries it needs to collect.

First, let's break down the information given:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to collect berries, we can calculate the number of berries it can collect in one hour:
\[ \text{Berries per hour} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 6 \text{ berries per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours per trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours and it collects 6 berries per hour, the total number of berries collected in 8 hours is:
\[ \text{Total berries} = 2 \text{ trips} \times 6 \text{ berries per trip} = 12 \text{ berries} \]

However, the sloth needs to collect 24 berries. Since the sloth can only collect 12 berries in 8 hours, it needs to make more trips. The number of trips required to collect 24 berries is:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{6 \text{ berries per trip}} = 4 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth can only make 2 trips in 8 hours, it needs to make 2 more trips to collect the remaining 12 berries. Therefore, the total number of berries the sloth can collect in 8 hours is 24, and the number of berries it picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{4 \text{ trips}} = 6 \text{ berries per trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 6."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56

Total cost of these items:
$16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) + $50 (Friday/Saturday movies) + $56 (other days movies) = $120

Colby's total budget for the month is $150. After spending $120, his remaining budget is:
$150 - $120 = $30

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $30. Since each movie ticket costs $10, he can see:
$30 / $10 = 3 movies

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs per day. Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed \(78 + 78 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[39 + 156 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299. To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 5:
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 59.8."
"The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance the bus travels is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance the car travels is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys Sophie has for her nephew.

The total number of other toys is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys for her nephew. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years."
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ water balloons} \]

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself, so the total number of water balloons before her mom gave more is:
\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ water balloons} \]

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ water balloons} \]

Adding these to the initial total, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They also have 10 boxes already: \(10\) boxes
- Total boxes: \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes

Next, let's determine how many tables they can fit with the total number of boxes:

- They can fit 2 boxes per table: \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:

- Tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15\) tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables."

Sydney spits a total distance of 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.
The total distance spat by both is 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.
The average total distance spat is 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The final numerical answer is 410."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\text{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron's stay is from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which totals 7 hours after the initial 12-hour stay. For the additional 7 hours, he pays 70 pesos per hour. Therefore, the cost for the additional hours is 70 * 7 = 490 pesos. The total cost for Cameron's stay is the initial 12-hour stay plus the cost for the additional hours, which is 1600 + 490 = 2090 pesos.

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option, he would have paid 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours is 1600 - 2090 = -490 pesos. However, since the question asks how much money Cameron would save, and he would actually spend more, the answer is that he would not save any money, but rather spend 490 pesos more. 

The final numerical answer is:
-490"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times \text{Hay per goat} - 3 \]

Given that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats and 12 sheep.

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money After Buying Pencils} = \text{Money After Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\text{Money After Buying Pencils}}{\text{Cost of One Pen}} = \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

For each school:
- Number of children in a row = 8
- Number of rows = 7
- Therefore, children per school = 8 * 7

For 5 different schools:
- Total children = (8 * 7) * 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of children.
```plaintext
Total children = (8 * 7) * 5
               = 56 * 5

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts to find the total charge:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, he gets them for 40% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $150:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

5 CDs * $15/CD = $75

Since he sells these 5 CDs for $40, he loses:

$75 - $40 = $35

Therefore, the total amount of money he was out is the cost of the 5 CDs he doesn't like plus the discount he didn't get:

$35 + $60 = $95

So, the final numerical answer is $95."
"To calculate the total earnings, I will multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, I will add these amounts to find the total earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time James spends swimming:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time swimming} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining distance} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time swimming} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time for remaining distance}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, and then subtract 40 from that number.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. Therefore, seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, subtract 40 from 490 to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers. Then she receives 5 more stickers, so she has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers. Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

Commission from New York Times = 10% of $5 * 6
= 0.10 * $5 * 6
= $3 * 6
= $18

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

Commission from Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 * 10
= 0.08 * $15 * 10
= $1.20 * 10
= $12

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
= $18 + $12
= $30

The total commission Cayley will earn is $30."
"Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Bahati scored the most points, so \( B > A \) and \( B > D \).
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \( B = A + 20 \).
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \( B = D + 10 \).

We also know the total points scored by the three individuals is 45:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

Since \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \), we can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
\[ A = D - 10 \]

Now, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points."

"Vince starts stapling at 8:00 AM and continues until 11:00 PM. The total time he worked is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 5 hours and 0 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5 hours is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 300 minutes, we divide 300 by 15:

300 minutes / 15 minutes per 30 reports = 20 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

20 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 600 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 600 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On that particular day, Kim woke up at 6 a.m. but was 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at:
\[ 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \]

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time she was not sleeping on her bed is 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 5 minutes (waking up early) = 28 minutes.

Subtracting this from her total sleep time:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

1. Two dozen measuring cups is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.
2. The number of measuring spoons is 2/3 of the number of measuring cups, so:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, we account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. Given that 1/5 of the beds are occupied, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

During the 2 weeks, there are 14 days. Each day, 50 patients are admitted, so the total number of patients admitted over 14 days is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding these 700 patients to the initially unoccupied beds gives:

\[ 800 + 700 = 1500 \text{ beds} \]

However, the hospital only has 1000 beds, so the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 1000 - 700 = 300 \text{ beds} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number and this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we have:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \).
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it's reasonable to assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as 7.25 would imply a fractional hole, which is not practical in this context).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 29 + \text{holes dug on the fourth day} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 = -1 \]

This calculation indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the number of holes at the end of the third day. If the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7, then the number of holes at the end of the third day should be:
\[ 7 + 10 + 13 - 2 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 = -1 \]

This indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct interpretation should be that the number of holes at the end of the third day is 28, and the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 = -1 \]

However, since the number of holes cannot be negative, the correct interpretation should be that the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 = -1 \]

The correct answer should be:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Therefore, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person received:
70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"The cost of the supplies is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the travel tickets, I will calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the original cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"To solve this, let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode.

It is also stated that the number of episodes is half as many as the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, we can write:
\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the number of minutes per episode:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"To determine the number of individual brownies Greta had left over, let's calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
2. At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, let's convert all the quantities to individual brownies:
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, let's sum up the total number of brownies received:
- Brownies from herself: 12
- Brownies from the office: 6
- Brownies from the friends' party: 48
- Total received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten:
- Brownies eaten: 18

Therefore, the number of brownies left over is:
- Brownies left over: 66 - 18 = 48

The final numerical answer is 48."
"Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.
The total age of all three family members is Nani's age + his brother's age + his sister's age, which is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
"To calculate the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, I will calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For synthetic gut:
3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

For polyester string:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For hybrid sets:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, I will add these times together:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To calculate the total cost for John and his family to buy phones, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of phones each person gets.

1. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each.
2. Each additional phone costs half the price of $600, which is $300.

John, his 2 kids, and his wife make a total of 5 people. So, they get 2 phones at full price and 3 phones at half price.

The cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The cost for the additional three phones is:
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, John paid $2100 for the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Combined, both teams have 13 + 20 = 33 players."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times P \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

Thus, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. Therefore, she kept 12 - 4 = 8 boxes of oranges.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she kept is 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges.

She sold the rest, which is 12 boxes - 8 boxes = 4 boxes of oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, we calculate half of the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

Half of the number of states in the USA is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Adding 4 to this number gives us the number of states in India:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, I will calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"If Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, then Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Together, Richard, Jerry, and Robert have 60 cherries. Since Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries, Jerry must have 60 - 20 - 30 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Saturday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

2. **Sunday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
   - Apple pie: 15 boxes

3. **Total Sales:**
   - Saturday's total: (10 boxes of gingerbread * $6) + (6 boxes of apple pie * $15)
   - Sunday's total: (15 boxes of gingerbread * $6) + (15 boxes of apple pie * $15)

4. **Calculating the Earnings:**
   - Saturday's earnings: (10 * 6) + (6 * 15) = 60 + 90 = $150
   - Sunday's earnings: (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = $315

5. **Total Earnings for Two Days:**
   - Total earnings = Saturday's earnings + Sunday's earnings = $150 + $315 = $465

Therefore, Sunny earned $465 for two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour and is outside for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means the red car costs 60% of the price of the blue car. 

To find the price of the red car, we calculate 60% of $100:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad and his brother when Emil is 24 years old.

1. When Emil is 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now (24 - 19 = 5).
2. At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old.
3. At that time, Emil's brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old.

According to the problem:
- When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
  \[
  24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5)
  \]
  Solving for \( D \):
  \[
  24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \implies 48 = D + 5 \implies D = 43
  \]
- When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
  \[
  24 = 2 (B + 5)
  \]
  Solving for \( B \):
  \[
  24 = 2 (B + 5) \implies 12 = B + 5 \implies B = 7
  \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:
- Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
- Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

The sum of their current ages is:
\[
43 + 7 = 50
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads} \]

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne has:
\[ 20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:
\[ 90 \]"
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught from Thursday to Saturday is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is 21 / 3 = 7 servings."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2:

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth and spacing. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each flower grows to be 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 1.5 feet is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

The total space required for one plant and the space next to it is 12 inches (for the plant) + 18 inches (for the space) = 30 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant and space:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants.

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds per sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds per carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound per rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.

First, Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck:
\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy each month is:
\[ \text{Pairs per month} = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs per month.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Pairs per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and sauteing the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.
- Therefore, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp:
- Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, to saute 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since Emily needs to do both peeling and sauteing, we add the time for peeling and sauteing:
- Total time = time to peel + time to saute = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Thus, it will take her 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour, so it cooled the room by:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, it was turned to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour, so it cooled the room by:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room would warm up by 2 degrees per hour, so it warmed up the room by:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees} \]

The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old.
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, meaning it will appear again in 75 years from the time Bill saw it for the first time.
   - Therefore, if Bill was 90 years old when he saw it for the second time, he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw it for the first time.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
15"

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to France is the same as the number of flights to Germany.

The number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4}F \]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F \]

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

So, we have:
\[ F = 88 \]

The number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, let's calculate the duration of each wolf's howl first.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous's howl is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total duration of their howls:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total duration in seconds is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his mother and father, and then subtract this from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is:
\[6 + 12 = 18\] dollars.

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[30 - 18 = 12\] dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"To find Wilfred's age, let's first determine the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
\]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
\]

Now, let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(A_s\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(A_s = 4\)
- \(H = 10\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + A_s + H + W = 20\).

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
17 + W = 20
\]

Solving for \(W\):

\[
W = 20 - 17 = 3
\]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to donate $200, which is the amount that will trigger the lawyer's donation.

Since the lawyer will donate three times the amount of what everyone else donates, the lawyer's donation will be:

$200 * 3 = $600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600."
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.
3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door based on the number of cookies given.

First, calculate the total number of cookies:
- There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\).

Next, determine how many cookies were given to the church next door:
- The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.
- Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is \(1500 \times \frac{1}{2} = 750\).

Finally, calculate the number of people in the church next door:
- Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.
- Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is \(750 \div 15 = 50\).

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on inpatients is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the total time at the clinic to find the remaining time:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining time back into hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

The cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes they sold together and then divide the total number of chocolate bars by this number.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a week and in a month:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month is: 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40/session * 12 sessions = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

First, let's find the number of female porcupines. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population of 50 porcupines.

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the babies born in a year to the initial population:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to find the volume of the pool and then multiply it by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed. After that, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

The volume \( V \) of the pool can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting the values:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Then, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet. Now, we need to convert this volume into gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \]

Next, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Matteo traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance Matteo traveled is:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Shandy traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the distance Shandy traveled is:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"Bethany runs 10 laps in one hour.
Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.
Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.
To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda, so Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be represented as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge after the first 5 hours. Mathematically, this can be represented as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical value:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536C = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.522 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.2%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and then find out how much she needs to save each week.

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:
   - Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours = $400
   - Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours = $600
   - Total weekly earnings: $400 + $600 = $1000

2. Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment:
   - The down payment is 20% of $10000, so:
     \[
     0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
     \]

3. Determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000:
   - She earns $1000 per week, so:
     \[
     \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks}
     \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * 0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * 0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * 1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * 0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
Remaining amount = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept two packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that were given to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate.
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."

"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
\[ 100 - 24 = 76 \]

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
\[ 76 - 15 = 61 \]

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

So, 30 new guests checked in:
\[ 61 + 30 = 91 \]

After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
\[ 91 + 7 = 98 \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
   - Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, each category has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
     - Easy questions: 24
     - Correct easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
   - Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct.
     - Average questions: 18
     - Correct average questions: 18 / 2 = 9 questions
     - Difficult questions: 18
     - Correct difficult questions: 18 / 2 = 9 questions

3. **Sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = $4 \) and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( 2x \) (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \)."
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines twice as much as with an iron pickaxe, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(12 \times 1.5 = 18\) pounds per day. However, this contradicts the information given that a steel pickaxe allows twice as much as an iron pickaxe, so we will use the information that a steel pickaxe allows twice as much.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 24 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine \(40 \times 24 = 960\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine \(960 \times 30 = 28800\) pounds in a month.

The final numerical answer is:
28800"
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich and then apply that to the 8-sandwich package.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package (with 8 sandwiches) will also be $1.5. Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is:
\[
8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys the new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Since 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Since there were 12 yellow balloons initially, the number of yellow balloons released is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. The number of blue balloons added is:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ blue balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ red balloons} + 6 \text{ yellow balloons} + 6 \text{ blue balloons} = 27 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios that prevent him from having to turn it in.

1. The probability that the substitute teacher will not collect the homework is 50%, or 0.5.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension, or 0.4.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and does not give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension, or 0.2.

The probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the following scenarios:
- The substitute teacher does not collect the homework (0.5).
- The normal teacher gives an extension (0.4).
- Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment (0.2).

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability. Let's calculate it step by step.

First, calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:
\[ P(\text{no homework}) = P(\text{substitute teacher}) + P(\text{extension}) + P(\text{personal extension}) \]
\[ P(\text{no homework}) = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 1.1 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to recognize that the sum of the probabilities of all mutually exclusive events (the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework) should be less than or equal to 1. Here, the sum is 1.1, which indicates an overlap or error in the interpretation. However, for the sake of this problem, we can consider the maximum possible overlap, which is 1. Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ P(\text{homework}) = 1 - P(\text{no homework}) = 1 - 1 = 0 \]

This indicates that the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 0, meaning it is impossible for him to avoid turning it in under the given conditions.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

The total number of seats available is 6000. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950, and the number of seats reserved for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of tickets that need to be distributed to the graduates and their guests is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

This 4750 tickets are to be split equally among the graduates. Assuming each graduate will give one ticket to a friend or family member, the number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Thus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
3. Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:
   \[
   150 \times 3 = 450
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is 450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
$15/day * 3 days = $45

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
$3/day * 3 days = $9

Subtracting her expenses from her earnings gives us her net earnings:
$45 - $9 = $36

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:
$36 / 18 hours = $2/hour

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted spends 3 books * 16 dollars/book = 48 dollars on books.
Ted spends 3 pencils * 6 dollars/pencil = 18 dollars on pencils.

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between each bottle}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next one, he will need to make 7 trips (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh to the eighth).

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Time per trip} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"There are 40 apples in one box, and Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples in total. He plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack, so the number of packs he can make is 80 / 8 = 10 packs."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mo buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mo buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Mo starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after her purchase:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

Therefore, the amount of money Mo will have left to buy meat is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he borrowed and the total income he lost.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed:
- Jim took 4 years to finish college.
- He borrowed $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total amount borrowed is \(4 \times 50,000 = 200,000\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim lost while in school:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- After college, his income tripled, so it became \(25,000 \times 3 = 75,000\) dollars a year.
- The income lost per year is the difference between his post-college income and his pre-college income, which is \(75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000\) dollars.
- Since he was in school for 4 years, the total income lost is \(4 \times 50,000 = 200,000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total amount borrowed and the total income lost:
- Total amount borrowed: $200,000
- Total income lost: $200,000
- Total amount to be earned: \(200,000 + 200,000 = 400,000\) dollars.

Finally, we need to determine how long it would take to earn $400,000 if Jim earns $75,000 per year after college:
- The amount of money Jim earns per year after college is $75,000.
- The time required to earn $400,000 is \(400,000 \div 75,000 = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33\) years.

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece: \( 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
- Total area: \( 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \)

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 102 \]

Then, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 209 \]

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

From the problem, we know:
- On the first race, he lost $5.
- On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $1 + 2 * $5 = $11.
- On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (he won, so this is a gain, not a loss)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Now, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races (3) to find the average amount lost per race:
Average amount lost per race = $21.5 / 3 = $7.16666666667

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
7.17"
"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

Therefore, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days they worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the value of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Value in 2008} = \text{Initial Value} \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Next, we calculate the value of the car in 2009:
\[ \text{Value in 2009} = \text{Value in 2008} \times 0.79 = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522 \]

Finally, we calculate the value of the car in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = \text{Value in 2009} \times 0.79 = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9825.18 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9825.18."

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already traveled. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The distance remaining can be calculated by subtracting the distance she has already traveled from the total distance to New York City. 

Total distance to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance already traveled: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance already traveled
Distance remaining = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

Thus, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, the additional cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the total cost with the increased insurance is:

\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 2304."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total loads per year = Total loads per week * Weeks per year
- Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

First, let's find out how many movies they watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies on Sunday.} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend. They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so in one weekend they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies.} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies.} \]

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 24. \]"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is 150 + 100 = 250.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so there are a total of \(4 \times 8 = 32\) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices (since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake).
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices they ate:

- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we sum up all these costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily response count by the number of work days in a week.

First, we know that James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of those emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, which is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

Therefore, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which means they ate \(20 \times 0.70 = 14\) pizzas. Therefore, the glee club has \(20 - 14 = 6\) pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which means they ate \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) pizzas. Therefore, the football team has \(40 - 32 = 8\) pizzas left.

The total number of pizzas left is the sum of the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team, which is \(6 + 8 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we first need to calculate the number of each type of coupon and then the cost for each type.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \text{ coupons} \times 5 \text{ cents/coupon} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \text{ coupons} \times 15 \text{ cents/coupon} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is calculated as follows:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ate 4 of these meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 meatball sub sandwiches is:

3 * 4 = 12 meatballs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 12."
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means:

1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

These 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser, so the remaining trucks that could deliver the fertiliser were:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Next, we need to apply the promotion:
- The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many pounds Dennis will actually pay for, we can divide the total pounds needed by 2:
- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- For every 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound.
- Therefore, for 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 pounds (since 6 divided by 2 is 3).

Now, we calculate the cost:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Dennis will pay for 3 pounds.
- Therefore, the total cost is 3 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $12.00.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Now, let's subtract the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 41 guests are more than 20, we need to calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Total cost = Rent fee for 20 guests + Additional cost for extra guests
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The party will cost $251."
"Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. Therefore, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. Therefore, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

The final numerical answer is 85."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week and then find out how many are left for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the number of bananas left for the third monkey is:
   \[
   315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. The third monkey eats the remaining bananas in a week. Therefore, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle. Teddy then finished another 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, during that hour, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the roses:
- Jenny bought 15 roses.
- The cost of one rose is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.

Next, determine the cost of a dozen roses:
- A dozen roses cost $15.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, which is more than a dozen, we need to calculate the cost of the additional roses beyond the dozen:
- The cost of a dozen roses is $15.
- The cost of 5 additional roses (since 15 - 12 = 3, and 3 roses is less than a dozen, we consider the next dozen as 12 roses) is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the cost of the additional 3 roses is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for 15 roses is \( 15 + 6 = 21 \) dollars.

Now, calculate the amount of money Jenny has:
- Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars.

Determine the change Jenny receives:
- The total cost is $21.
- The change she receives is \( 25 - 21 = 4 \) dollars.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Therefore, 4 dollars is equivalent to \( \frac{4}{0.25} = 16 \) quarters.

Thus, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

The total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule of the trains:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the second train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train arrives. Since the third train leaves immediately, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the first train arrives.

Now, let's calculate the arrival times of each train:
- First train: 10 minutes
- Second train: 30 minutes
- Third train: 30 minutes
- Fourth train: 50 minutes

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives 50 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train, which arrives 50 minutes after the first train arrives. Therefore, Paul will wait for 50 - 10 = 40 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, which totals to:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

First, let's calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received. The friend paid $1800 for a watch that originally cost $2000.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the discount percentage, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount amount}}{\text{Original price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours.

First, let's understand the rate at which jellyfish are created by one spring:
- One spring creates one jellyfish per second.

Next, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- For 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

Now, if one spring creates one jellyfish per second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:
- \(14400\) jellyfish.

Since we have 5 springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
- \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72000"
"Binkie's score was 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, so Frankie's score was 180 + 15 = 195.

So, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 45

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * (1/2) * $500 = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 45 * $500 = $22,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $22,500 = $101,250

Thus, Marcel earned $101,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the farmer will make:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the truck will pick up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

The total number of bales made minus the total number of bales picked up will give us the number of bales left in the field:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. John has 6 periods in a day, but he takes 2 extra classes, making it 8 classes per day.
2. Each class is 40 minutes long.
3. He goes to class for 5 days a week.
4. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class each day:
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total minutes he spends in class each week:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, let's calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

So, the total minutes John spends learning each week is:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Finally, let's convert the total minutes into hours:
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{170}{6} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball reaches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child who is 6 feet tall is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ 144 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up. Therefore, the combined speed at which they are separating is 60 mph + 30 mph = 90 mph.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we multiply their combined speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 90 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply that by the number of people he can help per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.

Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days:
\[ 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps in 40 days:
\[ 40 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ people/day} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people Billy helps is:
\[ 240 \]"

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide:
Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"Bobby's total break time per day is 30 minutes for lunch plus 2 times 15 minutes for breaks, which is 30 + 2 * 15 = 60 minutes. Over 5 days, the total break time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60, so 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours."

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, I will follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the discount.
5. Add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance.
6. Provide the final balance.

Step 1: Initial charge
Initial charge = $85.00

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the returned item
Cost of returned item = $15.00
Remaining balance after return = $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the discount
Original price of frying pan = $20.00
Discount on frying pan = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Cost of frying pan after discount = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the discount
Original price of set of towels = $30.00
Discount on set of towels = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Cost of set of towels after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Step 5: Add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance
Cost of frying pan = $16.00
Cost of set of towels = $27.00
Total cost of purchases = $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
New balance on credit card = $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Since the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

2. **Determine Lauren's retirement savings goal:**
   Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. We need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings} = 20,000 \times 20 = 400,000
   \]

3. **Determine Lauren's annual living expenses:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lauren's annual net savings for retirement:**
   Lauren's net savings for retirement each year is her annual savings minus her annual living expenses.
   \[
   \text{Annual net savings} = 20,000 - 40,000 = -20,000
   \]
   Since the annual net savings is negative, Lauren is not saving enough to cover her living expenses. Therefore, she cannot save for a retirement period of 20 years with her current salary and living expenses.

Given the negative net savings, Lauren cannot save for a retirement period of 20 years with her current salary and living expenses. Thus, the question as posed does not have a valid numerical answer."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

   \]

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts is divided into 5 equal parts. The length of each of these final parts is:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 centimeters."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike and the total number of days she will be on vacation.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days, so she will be hiking for 30 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we determine the total number of miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike per day from the number of miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours} \]

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 22 hours."
"To determine the number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance for a one-way trip.
2. Multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the round trip distance.

First, we calculate the distance for a one-way trip. The formula for distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

So, the distance for a one-way trip is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Adding the production rates of all four workers, we get:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Over a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by all four workers is:
\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, we calculated that the four workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker worked for the entire 10-hour shift, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."

2. Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris. So, before giving any to Kris, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, before giving any to Luis, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, I will calculate the total weight of the M&M in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, I will determine the total number of M&M in these 30 ounces. Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M, the total number of M&M is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, I will find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, let's find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. The problem states that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

\[ \text{Speed of the faster car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."

Vince is 9 years old now."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, the total painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). The total painted by Camden and Sarah is:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We already know that Arnold and Madeline painted \( 2A \) eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is:
\[ 56 - 30 = 26 \]
Since \( 2A = 26 \), we have:
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, I will calculate the length of the logs John can make from the tree.

The tree is 80 feet tall, and he can make logs out of 80% of it. Therefore, the length of the logs is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, John cuts these 64-foot logs into 4-foot logs. The number of 4-foot logs he can get from the 64-foot logs is:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Then, from each of these 4-foot logs, he cuts 5 planks. The total number of planks he gets is:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

He sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes is:
\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 96 \]"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, the combined salary of Valerie and her brother is:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile and her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \):
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

She aims to save a total of $60. The additional amount she needs to save is:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Therefore, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, I will add the birds from each tree together.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can determine the initial number of marbles Bob has by subtracting 24 from 60.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left.

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the remaining water in both mugs is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug after pouring 4 ounces:
- Initial temperature of the 33-degree mug: 33 degrees
- Temperature of the water poured out: 33 degrees
- Remaining water in the 33-degree mug: \( 33 - 33 = 0 \) degrees

Since the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is now 0 degrees, it is no longer relevant to the problem.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the remaining water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce:
- Initial temperature of the second mug: \( T \) degrees
- Temperature of the water poured out: \( T \) degrees
- Remaining water in the second mug: \( T - T = 0 \) degrees

Again, the remaining water in the second mug is now 0 degrees, which is not relevant.

However, we need to ensure that the water in the second mug, after the pouring, is at least 40 degrees. Since the second mug has been poured 1 ounce, the remaining water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 41 degrees.

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 41 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
41"
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks and then add that to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- For three weeks, they bring \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- For three weeks, they bring \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

The final numerical answer is 700."
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. Calculate the cost per bagel:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 18 scoops is 9 times 2 scoops (because 18 divided by 2 is 9), we need 9 times the number of potatoes required for 2 scoops. Therefore, the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Given:
- Total number of jellybeans = 60
- Number of green jellybeans = 17
- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

Let's calculate the number of red jellybeans:
Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To determine the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a decade.
2. Multiply the number of lemons from one tree by the number of trees Tim grows.

First, since each tree yields 6 lemons per year, in a decade (which is 10 years), one tree will yield:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Tim grows 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in a decade is:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets over the 3 days.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets:
- Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \) bouquets.
- Over 3 days, the number of bouquets sold is \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) bouquets.
- Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets over 3 days is \( 21 \times 12 = 252 \) sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) sunflowers.
- Over 3 days, the number of sunflowers sold is \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) sunflowers.

Adding the sunflowers sold from both bouquets and individual sunflowers over 3 days, we get:
- Total sunflowers sold = 252 (from bouquets) + 39 (from individual sunflowers) = 291 sunflowers.

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is 291."
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Determine how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the cost of the rocks he bought.
5. Determine the profit or loss.

First, Adam can buy rocks for $5 each with $100. Therefore, he can buy:
\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, he sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:
\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

The cost of the 20 rocks he bought is:
\[ \text{Cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

The loss Adam incurs is the difference between the cost and the revenue:
\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene and then sum these times.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For the small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the probability of winning for the second lottery ticket. If the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.20, then the second ticket, being three times more likely to win, has a probability of \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket being a winner. Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

The final numerical answer is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among the three of them. Therefore, each person gets:

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, for the weekend, he eats:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten during the weekdays and the weekend, we get:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it is 5 * 0.60 = 3 minutes longer. Therefore, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long. The total time for the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs, which is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes."
"To determine the profit Linus earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Calculate the total cost of the mobile devices bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, the selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price:
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices bought. Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of 6 devices:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Since he sold each of the 6 devices for $40:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Next, we subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- Therefore, the additional bottles needed are \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

The final numerical answer is 7300."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham sold.

He initially owned 80 square meters of land.

He sold half of the land:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]
He sold this land for $50.

He then sold another 1/4 of his land:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]
He sold this land for $30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned from the first two sales:
\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left to sell:
\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 (total hidden) - 27 (found) = 9 eggs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
   - 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
   - Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes:**
   - The total number of apartments is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

3. **Calculate the number of garbage collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex.
   - Therefore, the total number of collections per week is \(3 \times 1040 = 3120\).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week:**
   - John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

The final numerical answer is 1248."
"To calculate the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which is \(200 \times 10 - 200 = 1800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 1800 + 0 + 1000 = 3350 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 3350."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars. Therefore, Rissa initially has 15 dollars and Ronnie has 5 dollars.

Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]
\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12\]
\[x = 3\]

Now, we know that Rissa gave 3 dollars to her sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his sister, he also gave 3 dollars. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:
\[5 - 3 = 2\]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The red, white, and purple parts are equal in size.
3. The yellow part is half the mural.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

From the information given:
- \( R = W = P \)
- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{total mural} \)
- \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) pints

Since \( R = W = P \), we can say \( R + R + R + Y = 12 \) pints, which simplifies to \( 3R + Y = 12 \) pints.

Given that \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{total mural} \), and the total mural is 12 pints, we have \( Y = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Substituting \( Y = 6 \) into the equation \( 3R + Y = 12 \) pints, we get:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints."
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the remaining area of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 puffs.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 puffs.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 puffs.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.

To find the total number of puffs of clouds she counts from Monday to Friday, we add the counts for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:
\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling the number of bills means he has:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

bills. Since he has 60 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 60 \times 20 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by 5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

4 + 7 = 11 teeth

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is:

4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth

Now, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

To find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes, we calculate:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{1 \text{ hour}} \times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{20}{15} \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes} \]

So, in 15 minutes, Jay makes \(\frac{4}{3}\) snowballs. In an hour (which is 4 intervals of 15 minutes), he makes:
\[ 4 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of hours} \times \frac{16}{3} = 60 \]

Solving for the number of hours:
\[ \text{Number of hours} = 60 \times \frac{3}{16} = \frac{180}{16} = 11.25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 11.25 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, then 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. At that time, Jim was half of John's age, so Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices they all ate is:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the usage and ordering of bandages day by day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After ordering, they had \(38 + 50 = 88\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had \(88 - 28 = 60\) bandages left at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had \(60 + 100 - 25 = 135\) bandages at the end of the third day.

However, we are told that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was an error in the calculation. Let's correct it:

- They had 60 bandages at the end of the second day.
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(60 + 100 - 25 = 135\) bandages.
- But since they ended up with 78 bandages, the difference must be due to an error in the usage or ordering. The correct usage and ordering should be adjusted to fit the final count.

Let's re-calculate the usage and ordering to fit the final count of 78 bandages:

- They had 60 bandages at the end of the second day.
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they should have \(60 + 100 - 25 = 135\) bandages.
- But since they ended up with 78 bandages, they must have used fewer bandages than 25 on the third day. Let's denote the number of bandages used on the third day as \(x\). So, \(60 + 100 - x = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[60 + 100 - x = 78\]
\[160 - x = 78\]
\[x = 160 - 78\]
\[x = 82\]

This means they used 82 bandages on the third day, which is not possible since they only ordered 100 bandages. This indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 38 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting 2 inches.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60 \]

The cost for the color is $40.

Adding the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color together:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and the color is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate the earnings, I will add up the earnings from each task Jason completed.

For doing laundry: $3.00
For cleaning his room: $1.50
For taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, I will sum these amounts:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00 in a two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we will add the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered the restaurant by evening.

Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice the 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, which means she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the second day was \(1/4\) more than the first day, which is \(40 + (1/4 \times 40) = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we add the trees planted on each day:

- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\)."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Fred's wife, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Fred's friend Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons."
"Let the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge be denoted by \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be expressed as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

First, let's find the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of the fish have red stripes:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. Five-ninths of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which totals to:
\[2 \times 4 = 8\] colors.

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, which totals to:
\[3 \times 6 = 18\] colors.

So, before her sister steals one palette, Amy has:
\[8 + 18 = 26\] colors.

Her sister steals one palette, reducing the total to:
\[26 - 4 = 22\] colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\] colors.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\] colors."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Calculate the height of the second floor.

First, let's find the height of Mattison's house. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The first floor is three times as high as Mattison, so:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 280 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas found theirs.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 252 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of shells that team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"Let's denote the distance the last dog needs to walk as \( x \) miles.

The total distance the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the distances each dog needs to walk:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average distance the four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To determine how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount John gets.
2. Determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts.
3. Calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off the debts from the loan amount to find out how much money John has leftover.

\[
\text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

The price per kilogram is $0.50, so the total earnings will be:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

"To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, the profit is the selling price minus the cost price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, the profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day at each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed: \(3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\).

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will return to his sister, which includes the original $300 and an additional 2% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will return:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + (300 \times 0.02) = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months:
\[ \text{Amount paid over 11 months} = 11 \times 25 = 275 \]

Now, we find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month by subtracting the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the volume of the jar, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar, and then the number of red jelly beans based on the given efficiency and percentage.

First, calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar based on the given efficiency:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of the jar}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} \times \text{Efficiency} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.8 = 3600 \times 0.8 = 2880 \]

Now, calculate the number of red jelly beans:
\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = \text{Total number of jelly beans} \times \text{Percentage of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.3 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. Therefore, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Tim was 36 jelly beans off his guess."
"Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:

20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60 people.

At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. So, the number of people who entered at the second station is:

3/4 * 40 = 30 people.

Adding these to the bus, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:

60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90 people.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the third station is:

90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people currently on the bus from the bus's capacity:

200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of people) = 20 people.

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits over the 8 years.

First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase:
- The original cost of one visit is $2.
- The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
- 150% of $2 is \(0.15 \times 2 = 0.30\).
- Therefore, the new cost of one visit is \(2 + 0.30 = 2.30\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- The cost per visit is $2.30.
- The total cost for one year is \(3 \times 2.30 = 6.90\) dollars.
- For 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6.90 = 34.50\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:
- The cost per visit remains $2.30.
- The total cost for one year is still \(3 \times 2.30 = 6.90\) dollars.
- For 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 6.90 = 20.70\) dollars.

Finally, we add the total costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost for 5 years: $34.50
- Total cost for the next 3 years: $20.70
- Total cost for all 8 years: \(34.50 + 20.70 = 55.20\) dollars.

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so the number of groups needed is:
   \[
   \lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \rceil = \lceil 3.75 \rceil = 4 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, so the total time required is:
   \[
   4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

"Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
10

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of both a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:
- The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
- The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
- The total cost without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
- With a 20% discount, the total cost is reduced by 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $75, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15.
- Therefore, the discounted cost of both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers:
- Karen has 10 fingers (5 on each hand), and the cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- The total cost for nail art is 10 nails * $3/nail = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
- The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all."

1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues

Now, let's calculate the number of issues she receives from the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:

6 issues/magazine * 4 = 24 issues

Now, let's add up all the issues:

36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is 66."
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Shelley has as:
\[ K + 8 = 27 + 12 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ K + 8 = 39 \]

To find \( K \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"
"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, I will calculate the price step by step.

1. **November Price**: The toy was $40.
2. **December Price**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, I calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72
3. **January Price**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, I calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25% for veterans).
- The reduced rate is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
- Total earnings = Earnings from standard lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = \(320 + 120 = 440\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is 440 dollars."

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes Madeline ate, the grapes her brother used, and the grapes their mother used for the pies:
6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (brother's grapes) + 48 (mother's grapes) = 84 grapes.

The final numerical answer is 84."

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours in an 8-hour workday:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, we can calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning by dividing the total cleaning time by the total workday time and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{20}{40} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

This means Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = Water for half a cup plants + Water for 1 cup plants + Water for quarter cup plants
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we first need to calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and he needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes required.

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10. There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the cost for the four additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40. Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $20 + $40 = $60.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June. June has 30 days, and Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts each day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen doughnuts equal 120 doughnuts. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen/day} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue from selling 3600 doughnuts is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
\[ 7200 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos uploaded per day.
2. Divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day to find the number of days required.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day. She uploads 6 batches each day, and each batch contains 7 photos. Therefore, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

For one week:
- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

For 5 weeks:
- Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed:
- His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (Words Per Minute).
- His new speed is 2.5 times faster than his normal speed.

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages:
- Each page has 450 words.
- Therefore, 10 pages have:
\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Words Per Minute}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen each day over the week was 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \]

The total number of people seen over the first three days is:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 \]

The total number of people seen over the entire week is the sum of the people seen over the first three days and the people seen over the last four days. Let's denote the total number of people seen over the last four days as \( 4x \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 260 + 4x = 420 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 420 - 260 \]
\[ 4x = 160 \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is 40 each day. The total number of people seen over the last four days is:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Adding the number of people seen over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of people seen over the week:
\[ 260 + 160 = 420 \]

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial count:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ 210 \]"
"For 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 cups of fresh lemon juice. Since 1 cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons, 4 cups of lemon juice will require \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons for the 4 gallons.

Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs to make an additional 1 cup of lemon juice for the extra gallon. Since 1 cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons, Tim will need 6 lemons for the extra, twice as tart gallon.

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(24 + 6 = 30\).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption is \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding the legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

To find the number of pairs of legs:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

Thus, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The equation representing the total number of blocks is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance traveled west:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled west = 5 hours
- Distance west = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled east = 8 hours
- Distance east = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, find the net distance from the starting point:
- Distance west = 90 miles
- Distance east = 144 miles
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

Given:
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Total of red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
- Pink candies = Total candies - (Red + Orange + Yellow) = 232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider both the hotel and bus expenses.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, then before dropping the marbles, Dallas had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie initially had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any from the number of marbles he had after:

\[ 25 - 4 = 21 \text{ marbles} \]

This means Dallas received 21 marbles from Mazie. Since Mazie started with 52 marbles and gave 21 to Dallas, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \text{ marbles} \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 31."

"To calculate the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she meditates for 30 minutes each day.
- She meditates 5 days a week.

So, the time spent on meditation per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) each day.
- She practices yoga 5 days a week.

So, the time spent on yoga per week is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga per week:

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, I calculate 36 * 0.5 = 18 seeds.

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower, the large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, I add the seeds of the small sunflower and the large sunflower together: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is 90."

The price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.40) = 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to calculate the cost of their individual purchases and then sum them up.

Ellen's total cost:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
- Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's total cost:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Bathrobes: $100 each, and she bought two, so $100 * 2 = $200
- Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals:
- Total spent: $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

For one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 per jar = 10 * $50 = $500

Profit = Revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, I will calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
2. Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
3. Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
4. Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, I will sum these values to find the total dollar amount:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To calculate Josh's earnings in 2 weeks, we need to determine how many days he works in a week and then calculate his earnings based on the number of cars he services and his daily pay.

Josh works from Monday to Saturday, which is 6 days a week. He services 3 cars a day and is paid $4 per car.

First, calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Number of cars serviced per day} \times \text{Number of days worked per week} \times \text{Pay per car} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 3 \times 6 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 72 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks:
\[ \text{Earnings in 2 weeks} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Earnings in 2 weeks} = 72 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Earnings in 2 weeks} = 144 \]

Therefore, Josh makes $144 in 2 weeks."
"Randy initially has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

After eating 3 cookies, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

After these actions, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

In total, Randy has:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

Therefore, the total number of cookies he has now is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to break down the collection into two halves and calculate the earnings from each half separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
6 toy soldiers * $5/toy = $30

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
6 toy soldiers * $7/toy = $42

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we calculate 3/4 of the enrollment at Norman High School. 

The enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students. Therefore, the enrollment at Butler High School is:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students} \]

To find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 5400 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. Igor gathered 14 Petri dishes, but he gathered two more than requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. The total number of items gathered by Igor, including the beakers, is 29. 

To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to subtract the number of test tubes and Petri dishes from the total number of items placed on the lab bench.

Number of test tubes gathered = 8
Number of Petri dishes gathered = 16
Total number of items placed on the lab bench = 29

Number of beakers gathered = Total number of items placed on the lab bench - (Number of test tubes gathered + Number of Petri dishes gathered)
Number of beakers gathered = 29 - (8 + 16)
Number of beakers gathered = 29 - 24
Number of beakers gathered = 5

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is the number of beakers requested minus the number of beakers gathered.

Number of beakers requested = 7
Number of beakers gathered = 5

Number of beakers lost = Number of beakers requested - Number of beakers gathered
Number of beakers lost = 7 - 5
Number of beakers lost = 2

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the number of screws he has.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- James is putting together 4 tables.

Total number of legs = 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- There are 16 legs.

Total number of screws needed = 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

Screws left over = 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is 8."

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let the distance Aaron ran be \(d\) miles.
   - Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's speed is \(v\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \(2v\) miles per minute.
   - Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation for the distance Aaron ran as:
     \[
     d = 16 \times 2v = 32v
     \]

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can write:
     \[
     4 = 2d
     \]
   - Solving for \(d\):
     \[
     d = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Verify the consistency of the distances:**
   - From the first step, we have \(d = 32v\).
   - Substituting \(d = 2\) miles:
     \[
     2 = 32v
     \]
   - Solving for \(v\):
     \[
     v = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate Vanessa's time to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \(\frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.
   - Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the time \(t\) she took to complete her part is:
     \[
     t = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

He already has 6 feet of new line, so the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the profit and then add it to the cost price.

Profit = Cost Price * Profit Percentage
Profit = $80 * 25/100
Profit = $20

Total Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
Total Selling Price = $80 + $20
Total Selling Price = $100

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
Selling Price per Watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling Price per Watermelon = $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine the current age of James and Dora.

James is now twice as old as his sister Dora. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, let's find out how old John is now. John had James when he was 19, so John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is now \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange. In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Ana can peel is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. In one hour (60 minutes), the number of oranges Jane can peel is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5."
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:
